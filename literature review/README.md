# Literature Review Data Wrangling

This folder contains scripts and files for preprocessing raw exported literature data. The data have been screened and selected using Rayyan, and these scripts transform the cleaned datasets into formats compatible with Biblioshiny for bibliometric analysis.

## Purpose

- Convert and clean raw export files from literature databases.
- Prepare screened datasets for import into Biblioshiny.
- Enable efficient bibliometric and systematic review analyses.
