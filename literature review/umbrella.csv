rayyan-218255703,A review of LCA greenhouse gas emissions results for advanced biofuels: The use of meta-regression analysis,2013,10,,RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS,1364-0321,26,,108-134,"Menten, F and Chèze, B and Patouillard, L and Bouvart, F",,,,,"This article presents the results of a literature review performed with a meta-regression analysis (MRA). It focuses on the estimates of advanced biofuel Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions determined with a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The mean GHG emissions of both second (G2) and third generation (G3) biofuels and the effects of factors influencing these estimates are identified and quantified by means of specific statistical methods. 47 LCA studies are included in the database, providing 593 estimates. Each study estimate of the database is characterized by (i) technical data/characteristics, (ii) author's methodological choices and (iii) typology of the study under consideration. The database is composed of both the vector of these estimates-expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of biofuel (g CO(2)eq/Mn and a matrix containing vectors of predictor variables which can be continuous or dummy variables. The former is the dependent variable while the latter corresponds to the explanatory variables of the meta-regression model. Parameters are estimated by means of econometrics methods.        Our results clearly highlight a hierarchy between G3 and G2 biofuels: life cycle GHG emissions of G3 biofuels are statistically higher than those of Ethanol which, in turn, are higher than those of BtL. Moreover, this article finds empirical support for many of the hypotheses formulated in narrative literature surveys concerning potential factors, which may explain estimates variations. Finally, the MRA results are used to address the harmonization issue in the field of advanced biofuels GHG emissions thanks to the technique of benefits transfer using meta-regression models. The range of values hence obtained appears to be lower than the fossil fuel reference (about 83.8 in g CO(2)eq/MJ). However, only Ethanol and BtL do comply with the GHG emission reduction thresholds for biofuels defined in both the American and European directives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the relation between biofuels and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), seeking to present the main challenges, perspectives, and current developments discussed about them. A systematic review was performed to explore, specifically, the positive and negative impacts of the biofuels production on SDGs. The results show that biofuels contribute to achieving mainly SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), but they also cause negative impacts in other SDGs that vary according to generations. Third-generation biofuels become promising alternatives to increasing sustainable development in this sector. However, they require more research development to reduce production costs and facilitate their commercialization. The gathering of limitations and perspectives highlights a range of opportunities to the research areas that can contribute even more to increasing sustainability in biofuels production and, therefore, in the achievement of the SDGs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10668-020-01110-4,"",,

Biosequestration by microalgae has been suggested as a potential method for climate change mitigation due to its environmentally friendly nature and ability to produce high-value compounds. However, the large-scale application of microalgal biorefineries faces significant challenges, particularly in the harvest and processing stages, which are often costly and energy-intensive. This study aims to benchmark value-added fractions that can be produced via microalgae-based biorefineries against their commercially available counterparts. A systematic review was conducted using the Web of Science™ database to identify current commercial sources of proteins, lipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and pigments, this study identified key sectors and applications for each fraction, as well as potential market competitors. The results highlight substantial cost differences across production systems, with traditional agricultural sources demonstrating lower CAPEX but greater environmental challenges. Meanwhile, microalgal systems, although associated with higher CAPEX, offer advantages such as reduced land and water dependency, potentially leading to long-term economic resilience and environmental sustainability. By pinpointing research trends, key sectors and optimization opportunities, this work offers valuable insights into the profitability and competitiveness of microalgal systems, providing a benchmark for future optimization efforts. The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive comparison of microalgae-based and traditional production systems, establishing a clear benchmark for microalgal production and suggesting focus areas for enhancement. © The Author(s) 2025.","Export Date: 04 May 2025; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s13068-025-02633-6,Benchmarking and optimization;Life cycle assessment;Microalgal biorefineries;Techno-economic assessment;Value-added compounds;Abiotic;Biotic;Life cycle assessment;Microorganisms;Polyunsaturated fatty acids;Alternative to fossil fuels;Benchmarking and optimization;Biorefineries;Micro-algae;Microalga;Microalgal biorefinery;Optimisations;Production system;Techno-economic assessment;Value-added compound;benchmarking;climate change;fatty acid;life cycle analysis;microalga;mitigation;sustainability;Microalgae,,

The inherent uncertainties of US-based algal biofuels production were investigated by eliminating modeling uncertainty via comprehensive harmonization through a meta-analysis. Following harmonization, the cumulative fossil energy consumption (MJ/MJ), global warming potential (g CO2-eq/MJ) and water consumption (m3/MJ) of different algal biofuel process trains were investigated through a stochastic life cycle model. By focusing on the inherent differences of current technologies, this study identified (1) the differences in impact results between different process trains (i.e., different combinations of technology choices along the fuel production life cycle), (2) high impact hotspots, and (3) possible low impact process trains, all of which are crucial to further improve the sustainability of algal biofuels. The median (range) values of the three indicators for the most common algal biodiesel process train are 3.5 (2.9-4.2) MJ/MJ, 99 (55-151) g CO2-eq/MJ and 0.08 (0.07-0.09) m3/MJ, with corresponding inter-quartile ranges being 63%, 46% and 43% less than the literature values, respectively.

Although enormous research works have been carried out to identify microalgae species with high biomass and lipid productivities, genetic modification of strains as well as optimization of cultivation conditions, however, the progress is yet to be fully satisfied. Based on the present lipid yield and extraction methods, it is still not feasible to commercialize the microalgae biodiesel. One of the promising approaches to elevate lipid accumulation by microalgae is through tuning the cellular mechanisms and metabolic pathway by exposing microalgae cells to various abiotic stress environments such as nutrient starvation, high salinity level and strong light intensity. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis of quantitative influences of critical abiotic stress on both microalgae biomass and lipid profile is still limited in the literature. Hence, the present paper aims to deliver insights into selections of single and multiple abiotic stress factors for simultaneous enhancement of microalgae biomass and lipids (polar and non-polar) which could improve the techno-economic viability in the microalgae processing chains and biorefinery industries.

The present study aims to render an inclusive knowledge map of the BSC-related scientific production. In this vein, a systematic review, supported by a keywords co-occurrence analysis and qualitative content analysis, was carried out on a total of 1,975 peer-reviewed journal articles in the target literature.

Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) can contribute to feedstock diversification and improved biomass conversion efficiencies along supply chains, although concerns arise about their actual viability and competitiveness. A systematic review of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and related process-based approaches is carried out to evaluate the sustainability of advanced bio-based technologies, defined as those that use either non-food feedstock or circularity principles –or both– for delivering diverse products. A classification scheme is proposed to categorise KETs based on the feedstock employed (plant residues and perennials, designer crops, algae, or biological waste) or the underlying technological configuration (enzyme/microbial assisted processing or biorefineries). Results show that producing biofuels and biochemicals from perennial plants, lignocellulosic residues and algae has advantages in terms of greenhouse gas emissions relative to their fossil counterparts, while trade-offs occur with other environmental impacts and sustainability dimensions. Cradle-to-cradle systems can deliver additional sustainability gains, but their implementation poses technical and socio-political challenges.

Biological treatment of industrial and domestic wastewater using Activated Sludge Nutrient Removal (ASNR), the conventional process, is well known; however, it is relatively expensive due to the requirement for high energy inputs. Microalgal applications have been gaining interest as they offer potential cost-effective measures for the treatment of wastewater in the peri-urban and rural areas. Such systems provide an interesting tertiary biological treatment method where valuable biomass is produced with simultaneous uptake of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous with reduction in coliform bacteria, heavy metals, chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (COD & BOD) and the removal/degradation of xenobiotic compounds etc. This paper provides a systematic review on the current microalgal applications (phycoremediation) for wastewater treatment with advanced information on their role towards nutrient recovery and energy (biogas) production under the third generation biorefinery concept.

Nevertheless, its reported climate impacts in the scientific literature vary significantly. This article describes and synthesizes the range of results found in the life cycle assessment (LCA) literature regarding microalgae biodiesel studies to investigate whether particular parameters, e.g. technologies, were associated with higher or lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions so that a best practice can be inferred from currently available LCA data and thereby recommended. Methods: A systematic literature review and meta-regression analysis (MRA) of 36 LCA studies that report on the GHG emissions of microalgae biodiesel was conducted. An assessment of key aspects, including modelling choices and technologies, was performed. Furthermore, MRA models were formulated considering several variables of interest describing both technical and modelling choices to identify the main causes for the variability in GHG emissions per MJ of biodiesel. Variables chosen include: microalgae species; culture medium; cultivation system; source of CO2; extraction technology; conversion technology; system boundary; geographical scope; inclusion or exclusion of capital goods; and how multifunctionality was handled. Results and discussion: The reviewed studies altogether reported 308 results ranging from −0.7 to 3.8 kg CO2 eq. MJ−1biodiesel, portraying 19 different system configurations. Despite the comprehensive range of variables assessed, the models generated could not plausibly explain that the variability in GHG emissions depends either on the technologies considered or on the methodological choices adopted. However, the following relationships could be observed: location in Europe and high oil productivity were associated with lower emissions, whilst dry extraction should be avoided for leading to higher GHG emissions, on average. Conclusions: There is a large degree of variability within the technologies considered, as well as the methodological choices adopted, so that no robust conclusions could be drawn from the MRA. Notwithstanding, average GHG emissions reported were more than twice as high as fossil diesel and, while there are some studies showing large benefits, none of the various algae technologies performed consistently better than fossil diesel, questioning the climate-mitigation potential of microalgae biodiesel. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 04 May 2025; Cited By: 36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11367-020-01780-2,Algae;Biodiesel;Greenhouse gas emissions;Life cycle assessment (LCA);Meta-regression analysis;Review;biodiesel;oil;Article;Europe;extraction;greenhouse;life cycle;life cycle assessment;microalga;nonhuman;priority journal;technology,,

This review aims to compare different microalgae production systems that are used to produce microalgae for human nutrition in different climatic zones. A systematic literature review according to the systematic review checklist STARR-LCA was performed using ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. The studies were included that utilized primary data, used a functional unit based on dry algal biomass and were modeled cradle-to-gate. Only the studies conducted in real pilot and experimental plants were considered. The data for the life cycle inventory were recorded and harmonized, and the environmental performance of the different microalgae species and their cultivation methods were then modeled in SimaPro according to ISO 14040/44 using the ecoinvent database v3.4. Sixteen different production scenarios were examined with cultivation plants located in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States and Singapore. Open raceway ponds were compared to horizontal, vertical and bubble column photobioreactors. Five different microalgae species were investigated: Nannochloropsis sp., Scenedesmus dimorphus, Heterosigma akashiwo, Alexandrium minutum and Karlodinium veneficum.

In addition, microalgae offer several environmental benefits, and do not compete with food production for land, fresh water, and nutrients. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to provide a quantitative, systematic and harmonized assessment of current bio-energy potential. The analysis is conducted by considering all the main steps in detail, from cultivation to biodiesel production, and by deriving an overall estimation of energy consumption for biodiesel production. Energy consumption uncertainty is also quantified and discussed. A systematic review of all the main technologies available for all the main processing steps towards the production of biodiesel from microalgae is presented, focusing on the derivation of the Net Energy Ratio (NER) of each combination of technologies, complemented by an uncertainty analysis of the data used and those obtained in the present work. A wide scatter in the data available in the literature has been identified, highlighting the need for an uncertainty analysis. If the average overall energy consumption per unit of biodiesel mass is considered, all the routes adopting a raceway pond have a lower energy consumption, but if the uncertainty on the overall energy consumption is also considered, the minimum value of the range of NER values for some of the routes adopting a photobioreactor is comparable to the NER value obtainable by using raceway ponds. Thus, the present framework proposes a harmonized and comprehensive methodology to compare and contrast technologies for the production of biodiesel from microalgae, and is applied in this paper to identify, with an appreciation of the uncertainty, the most promising combinations of technologies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 04 May 2025; Cited By: 22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.rser.2018.11.024,Biodiesel;Bioenergy;Microalgae;Net energy ratio;Uncertainty;Biodiesel;Bioethanol;Energy utilization;Lakes;Microorganisms;Uncertainty analysis;Bio-energy;Biodiesel production;Energy-consumption;Energy-potentials;Fast growth rate;Micro-algae;Net energy ratios;Raceway pond;Systematic assessment;Uncertainty;Microalgae,,

This work describes the state of the art of microalgae production from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), its potential to generate electricity and the scale in which it is possible. The methodology used was a systematic review of the gasification of microalgae from 49 articles selected. Based on the review, a conceptual scenario for microgeneration in WWTP using as feedstock microalgae for thermal gasification was developed. The most consistent assumptions for a real scale microgeneration are microalgae production in open ponds using domestic sewage as a nutritional medium; the use of the flocculation process in process of harvesting; microalgae to energy through thermal gasification process using a downdraft gasifier. Considering a WWTP with a 3000 m3/d flux capacity, 860 kg/d of dry microalgae biomass might be produced. For which, gasification has a production potential of 0.167 kWh/m3 of treated sewage, but the energy balance is compromised by the drying process. However, when the biogas produced in anaerobic treatment enter in the model, it is possible to add a surplus of electricity of 0.14 kWh/m3 of treated sewage. Finally, a cost estimate is made for the acquisition of drying and gasification-electricity generation systems.

The perceived benefits provide the underpinning rationale for much of the public support directed towards micro-algae research. Here we examine three aspects of micro-algae production that will ultimately determine the future economic viability and environmental sustainability: the energy and carbon balance, environmental impacts and production cost. This analysis combines systematic review and meta-analysis with insights gained from expert workshops. We find that achieving a positive energy balance will require technological advances and highly optimised production systems. Aspects that will need to be addressed in a viable commercial system include: energy required for pumping, the embodied energy required for construction, the embodied energy in fertilizer, and the energy required for drying and de-watering. The conceptual and often incomplete nature of algae production systems investigated within the existing literature, together with limited sources of primary data for process and scale-up assumptions, highlights future uncertainties around micro-algae biofuel production. Environmental impacts from water management, carbon dioxide handling, and nutrient supply could constrain system design and implementation options. Cost estimates need to be improved and this will require empirical data on the performance of systems designed specifically to produce biofuels. Significant (>50%) cost reductions may be achieved if CO2, nutrients and water can be obtained at low cost.
