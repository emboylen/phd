## Methodology

### BERTopic Algorithm

BERTopic is a topic modeling technique that leverages transformer-based language models and class-based TF-IDF to create dense clusters and extract meaningful topics.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Document Embedding:** Papers converted to semantic embeddings using sentence transformers
2. **Dimensionality Reduction:** UMAP used to reduce embedding dimensions
3. **Clustering:** HDBSCAN algorithm groups similar papers
4. **Topic Representation:** Class-based TF-IDF extracts representative keywords

### Dataset Alignment

- **Original BERTopic analysis:** 223 papers
- **Original bibliometric dataset:** 222 papers
- **Aligned dataset (this analysis):** 207 papers

Only papers present in BOTH datasets are included to ensure consistent bibliometric metadata (publication year, citations, funding) for temporal analysis.

### Quality Metrics

- **Average Topic Probability:** 0.605
  _(Higher is better; >0.5 indicates strong topic assignment)_

- **High Confidence Assignments (>0.5):** 101 papers (48.8%)
