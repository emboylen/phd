Among various solutions microal gae emerge as a promising zero-carbon alternative addressing both biofuel produc tion and carbon sequestration. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of cultiva tion methods for microalgae biofuel conver sion techniques bioethanol and biodiesel and their role in reducing eliminating green house gas GHGs emissions. Recent develop ments in cultivation methods such as photobioreactors and open-pond cultivation have shown encouraging results regarding the CO2-capturing potential of microalgae. Specific microal gal strains such as Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sp. exhibit high biomass productivity 0.4 and 1.21 g L d respectively and CO2 fixation rates 0.49 and 0.25 g L d respectively standing out as the most viable for biofuel synthesis.

Introduction Rapid urbanization and industrial development such as power plants process industries and oil refineries are prone to the widespread use of nonrenewable energy sources and have flooded the environment with carbon and other pollutants Burrington 2024 . Over the last century all coun tries have had a large influx of ozone-depleting substances and increased CO2 concentration approximately 75 of ozone-depleting greenhouse gases GHGs de_Richter et al. 2017 . Table 1 shows the significant contributors to CO2 emissions worldwide along with the amount of CO2 emissions and megawatt hours of energy capacity. Among the notable contributors China has made significant investments in renewable energy sources and the United States has passed legislation promoting green and renewable energy advancement. To better balance economic development and sustainability India Germany Russia and Japan have focused on increasing energy efficiency and researching more environmentally friendly energy sources Chien et al. 2021 Zhang Kong 2022 . The nonrenewable fossil fuels and the increased use of petroleum products have led to a massive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations thus a transition is required to absorb the atmospheric CO2 Wang et al. 2023 . Similarly global fossil fuel consumption exceeded 500 g t of CO2 by November. To maintain stable atmospheric CO2 concentrations until 2050 carbon-neutral energy sources must be adopted to reduce harmful fuel emissions by 50 Rochedo et al. 2021 . Therefore sustainable developments are expected to reduce adverse outcomes for which research ers are working throughout the control cycle to help reduce environmental problems caused by CO2 emissions. To alleviate the effects of climate change carbon capture utilization and storage CCUS objects can be used to reduce carbon in the environment by sequestering it into an insoluble structure or completely transforming it into a usable configuration Yan et al. 2021 . In this regard microalgae have great potential as cheap feedstock for developing zero-carbon solutions and biofuel production. Consequently using microalgae to capture CO2 could be an economic shift to facilitate the commercialization of these frameworks while reducing high global CO2 concentrations Goswami et al. 2024 . These studies have driven attention to numerous aspects of biofuel production via microalgae-based routes to obtain carbon-free fuel production Samartha et al. 2022 . Additionally Table 1.

Efforts have been made to supply low-cost feedstocks such as CO2 and toxic water streams from industrial sources Abdel-Raouf et al. 2012 Goveas et al. 2022 R. Kumar et al. 2020 . Therefore by the integration of carbon capture and utilization techniques to produce microalgae-based biofuel a closed-loop carbon cycle can be obtained Onyeaka et al. 2021 . With an assumption of absorption capacity of 1.83 kg CO2 kg microalgae the growth of microalgae can be said to be progressive Sajjadi et al. 2018 . Hence an ongoing focus on microalgae as raw materials for bioenergy production is vital. They are the most prom ising raw materials for balancing and regulating the growing demand for biofuels as cheap feed stocks to produce biofuels and other bioproducts by fixing atmospheric CO2 Sadvakasova et al. 2023 . The applicability of microalgae for biofuel production and CO2 sequestration has been reported in the literature. However the reported study focuses on either of these applications lacking an integrated evaluation of these processes. This review aims to fill this gap by offering a compre hensive overview of the current state and understanding the opportunities and challenges asso ciated with a particular focus on the potential of microalgae for zero-carbon applications. Furthermore a comparative techno-economic assessment of various cultivation techniques offering insights into cost-effectiveness and industrial applications is not reported to the best of our knowledge . This review therefore aims to provide a thorough and critical assessment of the existing knowledge and recent developments in utilizing microalgae for biofuel production and carbon sequestration while addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with the technical and economic feasibility and its life cycle. 2. Chemistry of microalgal CO2 fixation O Leary 1988 revealed the mechanism of carbon dioxide CO2 absorption by microalgae. The CO2 absorption involves passive diffusion of CO2 molecules across the microalgal cell membrane which are then driven by concentration gradient into the cytoplasm of cells and fixed in two ways through the C3 and C4 pathways. Most algae use the C3 pathway also known as the Calvin cycle. In this pathway CO2 and a 5-carbon compound ribulose-1 and 5-bisphosphate combine to produce two 3-carbon compounds S. Li et al. 2022 . As part of their photosynthetic cellular activity the key enzyme in the C3 carbon fixation process which is produced by microalgae is ribulose-1 5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase RuBisCO . This enzyme starts the CO2 conversion into a 6-C organic compound from the atmosphere followed by splitting into two 3-carbon compounds 3-phosphoglyceeric acid . Certain microalgae species diatoms and plants like corn sugar cane and millet utilize the C4 pathway for CO2 fixation. The C4 plants use CO2 and three-carbon compounds to produce a single 4-carbon compound oxaloacetate via photo respiration which increases CO2-dependent productivity. The 4-carbon compound is later trans ported to specialized bundle sheath cells releasing CO2 for the Calvin cycle. The overview of carbon capturing mechanisms CCM is vital in understanding the capabilities of microalgae in the field of carbon capture and storage. The role of numerous intracellular and extracellular carbonic anhydrases CAs in microalgal cells is also reported in the literature Zieliński et al. 2023 . With the decrease in the quantity of inorganic carbon in the atmosphere the role of CA becomes interestingly significant. Active transport of bicarbonate ions HCO3 into the cell is another important aspect of microalgae CCM. In their respective cell membranes the bicarbonate transporters are controlled by microalgae which when the levels of CO2 are comparatively low take up the bicarbonate ions in the environment Jensen et al. 2020 . Through these mechanisms within the chloroplast envelope microalgae can produce significant compounds such as polysaccharides lipids pigments proteins nutrients bioactive compounds and cell enhancers as shown in Fig. 1. 1252 M. A. RASHAD ET AL. 3. Microalgae cultivation systems In recent times attention has been diverted toward microalgae systems because of their capa bilities toward sequestering CO2 and for producing biofuels. These microalgae are typically microscopic photosynthetic organisms Jalilian et al. 2020 Kassim Meng 2017 . Because of their various characteristics i.e. ease of cultivation high photosynthetic efficiency rapid growth rates and nutritional requirements microalgae are highly efficient at carbon sequestration Siddiki et al. 2022 . The sequestration of CO2 through microalgae is carried out through photosynthesis i.e. using CO2 water and sunlight to produce organic compounds primarily carbohydrates while releasing oxygen. As microalgae continue to grow through photosynthesis the accumulation of carbon-rich organic matter within their cells results in carbon sequestration from the atmosphere and nutri ents nitrogen and phosphorus from farmland run-off water Peter et al. 2021 . Culturing microalgae in contaminated environments such as wastewater ponds polluted industrial water streams and absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere presents a solution for environmental remediation by sequestering maximum nutrients and CO2 thereby reducing GHG concentrations and limiting global warming and its associated impacts Comley et al. 2024 . The cultivation of microalgae is carried out either in a photobioreactor system heterotrophic or in an open pond system photo-autotrophy which is demonstrated in Fig. 2 Zhu et al. 2019 . To synthesize energy-rich compounds from inorganic carbon sources such as CO2 H2CO3 HCO3 and CO3 2 photo-autotrophy permits them to make use of the sunlight K. Kumar et al. 2011 R. Kumar et al. 2024 . The characteristics of photo-trophy cultivation consist of its ability to tolerate naturally varying temperatures salinity absorption independence from land resources and maintenance of pH. Despite being cost-effective open ponds possess various disadvantages i.e. significant contamination percolation and sand suspension. Due to variations in environ mental conditions and susceptibility to contamination open-pond cultivation is restricted to a limited number of species considering specific soil and environmental conditions Devi et al. 2024 . The open-pond system was designed with various shapes sizes and construction mate rials. It slopes like a paddle wheel undeveloped lagoons round swing arm lagoons and overflow decks with gently sloped beds. Mixing and circulating water at a typical depth of 15 50 cm in the open pond system helps maintain the microalgae cells in suspension. CO2 supply is met naturally at the air water interface but it can also be supplemented by submerged aerators to circumvent carbon limitations Verma et al. 2020 . In contrast photobioreactor systems are closed heterotrophic systems in which a part made of light-transmitting material is specifically allocated to photosynthesis under controlled condi tions Bibi et al. 2022 . Different types of photobioreactors are used for heterotrophic cultivation considering the optimization of the process and maximum yield such as batch systems used in a defined medium volume. Within photobioreactors an air bubble mechanism or mechanical pump circulates the microalgal culture facilitating the exchange of O2 and CO2 between the FIG. 1. Cellular chemistry of CO2 utilization by microalgae. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology 1253 medium and gas phases Kanna Dasan et al. 2023 . The researchers R. N. Singh Sharma 2012 used different photobioreactor systems such as annular and tubular photobioreactors in which the batches of microalgae pass through long cylinders where mechanical hoods or air droplets generate siphon forces to ensure the maximum exchange of O2 and CO2 between liquid and gaseous media. Flat panel photobioreactors provide higher photosynthetic efficiency and are thus the most valuable type of photobioreactor Kanna Dasan et al. 2023 . Typically the oper ational and maintenance costs of different photobioreactors are high. However increased pro ductivity increased CO2 absorption capacity reduced risk of contamination and the practical scale required for biofuel production can offset these negative factors P. Cheng et al. 2022 . The term mixed hybrid system under photoautotrophic conditions corresponds to two dis tinct approaches a culture system that couples photobioreactors and open ponds or basins that can be either open or transitioned into a closed culture mode based on the amount of CO2 available Chauton et al. 2015 . Mixotrophic development cannot rely solely on photosynthesis because light is not a fully limiting variable as light or natural substrates are available for the product. Besides this fermenters are used for industrial production typically with a large reactor volume allowing biomass production of 20 100 g L compared to 0.5 1.0 g L biomass produced in open systems Condor et al. 2022 . Within this system microalgae can capably grow under controlled growth conditions with maximum CO2 fixation however the costs and availability of microalgae used in the fermenter increase the cost-ineffectiveness of the process. However different microalgal species exhibit variable tolerance to CO2 concentrations Varshney et al. 2020 . In a study involving Chlorella vulgaris optimal growth occurred at 5 v v CO2 whereas a higher concentration of 15 v v CO2 exhibited inhibitory effects C.-T. Li et al. 2021 . The higher levels of CO2 hinder microalgal growth due to acidification within the chlo roplast resulting in the inactivation of enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle and consequently growth is inhibited. It is essential to recognize that an optimal CO2 concentration does not ensure maximum biomass production for all microalgae species. For example Chlorella vulgaris Scenedesmus obliquus and Nannochloropsis oculata exhibited high tolerance to varying CO2 levels 100 80 and 45 respectively however their maximum biomass productivity was observed at 10 10 20 and 5 CO2 respectively Ganesh Saratale et al. 2022 . The 10 15 concentration range of CO2 is significant as certain microalgal species thrive within this range. This CO2 concentration range is often encountered in flue gases from cement FIG. 2. Schematic of different configurations for microalgae cultivation. 1254 M. A. RASHAD ET AL. and coal-fired power plants and constitutes a significant source of GHG pollution Barati et al. 2022 . The production of 100 tons of microalgal biomass allows for the fixation of approximately 180 tons of CO2 Patricio et al. 2017 . Among the major sources of CO2 emissions industrial processes play a key role. Furthermore CO2 sequestration primarily regulates the pH in microal gae cultures. pH of the culture medium increases due to CO2 absorption by microalgae and thus can be used as an indicator of moderate inflows of CO2. This could serve as a promising CO2 control parameter for microalgal cultivation offering potential opportunities for effective carbon capture Vale et al. 2020 . 4. Biofuel and biochar production potential of microalgae At present the energy requirements of the world are met mostly through fossil fuels which are not only limited and nonrenewable but also harmful to the environment by producing GHGs. Microalgae have a promising future as raw materials for producing bioethanol and biodiesel which are considered third and fourth-generation biofuels as well as biochar. Microalgae provide a sustainable economic and feasible solution to cope with the ever-increasing energy demands Malla et al. 2022 . The next part of this article includes an examination of existing literature on biofuels and biochar synthesis from microalgae. 4.1. Bioethanol Bioethanol production has significant potential as a renewable energy source because it can be used as a substitute for gasoline or blended with gasoline to reduce GHG emissions Sydney et al. 2019 . In comparison to traditional crops e.g. sugarcane corn wheat etc. bioethanol production from microalgae has considerable advantages i.e. fixation of CO2 from microalgae at a comparatively faster growth rate than traditional crops therefore within a short span of time bioethanol can be produced. Bioethanol production involves several processes cultivation pretreatment saccharification fermentation and distillation as shown in Fig. 3. The choice of cultivation method for bioethanol production depends on the cost of production the type of microalgae being grown and the desired scale of production. Considering the selection criteria photobioreactors are suitable environments for growth on a commercial scale to fix the maximum amount of CO2. FIG. 3. Process flow for bioethanol production from microalgae with CO2 fixation. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology 1255 It should be noted however that this procedure frequently involves a vital pretreatment step. This phase is particularly important for breaking down the microalgae s thick cell walls and increasing intracellular glucose availability. Following pretreatment more efficient saccharification of carbohydrates and fermentation of suitable sugars occur resulting in higher bioethanol yields. Chemical pretreatment of microalgal biomass using acids such as H2SO4 HCl and HNO3 or bases such as NaOH KOH and Na2CO3 is efficient because of its rapidity cost-effectiveness and ease of application Saravanan et al. 2023 . However their reliance on high temperatures pressure and acid concentrations is the drawbacks of these treatments. Some carbohydrates from degraded microalgal biomass generate toxic compounds and inhibit yeast metabolism during fermentation for bioethanol production Kusmiyati et al. 2023 . Therefore optimization of the chemical pretreatment conditions is essential for this process. Enzymatic pretreatment is one of the prominent methods of biomass pretreatment. In this method enzymes hydrolase and cellulose act on biomass to convert it into reducing sugars which then include glucose Constantino et al. 2021 . Enzymatic pretreatment has several advantages over chemical pretreatment since it does not leave toxic byproducts does not operate under extreme conditions and yields a higher conversion rate. Temperature pH and inhibitor effects need to be correlated with opti mum enzyme operating conditions to maximize enzyme activity. For chemical and enzymatic pretreatments hydrothermal electric pulse wet oxidation microwaves or ultrasonic techniques can be utilized Agarwalla et al. 2023 . A study on bioethanol production from the biomass of the carbohydrate-rich Chlorella vulgaris FSP-E strain Ho et al. 2013 reported a glucose yield of 90.4 0.461 g ethanol g biomass after pretreatment with 1 sulfuric acid at 140 °C for 30 min and a glucose yield of 93.6 after pretreatment with 3 sulfuric acid at 160 °C for 15 min. After the enzymatic reaction the theoretical yields were 90 and 79 respectively indicating enhanced growth parameters. Using either separate hydrolysis and fermentation SHF or simultaneous saccharification fermentation SSF it is possible to obtain the fermentation of microalgae-based sugars Kusmiyati et al. 2023 . To initiate the fermentation in the SHF process the sugars that is achieved from pretreatment are supplied to the fermenter Huang et al. 2020 . However there are various parameters that can reduce the effectiveness of fermentation processes i.e. high temperature pressure and the presence of inhibitors. On the other hand maintaining a neutral pH can optimize the fermentation process. Followed by fermentation the distillation of the product is conducted to achieve high-purity 99 mol ethanol and for microalgae cultivation the byproduct CO2 gas is reused. For microalgal bioethanol production via the SHF method various studies have been reported identifying the different yields of ethanol from different microalgal species. The researchers Jeyakumar et al. 2022 obtained 0.29 g of ethanol per gram of microalgal biomass. Zymomonas mobilis bacteria were used to convert Scenedesmus obliquus into bioethanol yielding 0.213 g ethanol g biomass and higher growth rates Condor et al. 2022 . Furthermore because of the high carbohydrate content in various strains owing to the absorbed CO2 microalgae are a potential low-cost feedstock. Different microalgal strains have diverse growth conditions Chlorella is best known for its high CO2 absorption and grows in a wide range of temperatures Ashour et al. 2024 . However it is typically grown at a temperature of 20 30 °C and a pH of 7 8. Scenedesmus grows more efficiently in open ponds than in photo bioreactors because in open culture they absorb more CO2 at a temperature of 20 30 °C and a pH of 7 9 Arun et al. 2022 . Spirulina Dunaliella and Nannochloropsis are other dominant strains with high CO2 sequestration used to produce bioethanol. Moreover many studies have used rotary bioreactors with a vertical axis developed to increase the light flux and CO2 absorp tion to deliver the product Han et al. 2022 . Considering the commercialization need for clean cost-effective and robust technologies modified reactor configurations have been used in various studies to lower costs while enhancing yield. Regardless of the advantages discussed earlier there are numerous challenges that are asso ciated with the use of microalgae for bioethanol production. Production cost and delivery to the end user through commercialization are key challenges which need further research to 1256 M. A. RASHAD ET AL. optimize the efficiency of fermentation processes and lipid extraction methods to make them more economically feasible Wiatrowski et al. 2022 . Owing to growing concerns regarding the environmental impact of fossil fuels bioethanol production is estimated to increase significantly despite the limitations in the potential capacity. Bioethanol production capacity from microalgae of 15 and 8 billion gallons from the USA and Brazil respectively are reported de Souza Abud de Farias Silva 2019 . Similarly China India and the European Union are cutting their dependency on fossil fuels by enhancing bioethanol production capacity eventually producing green energy. 4.2. Biodiesel Biodiesel production from microalgae by sequestering CO2 depends on various parameters 1 the efficiency of the conversion process in different process configurations 2 the volume of CO2 utilized from the atmosphere and 3 the strain of microalgae grown. The efficiencies of transesterification and lipid extraction are vital parameters in determining the processes involved in biodiesel production Deshmukh et al. 2019 . Transesterification is also dependent on the molar ratio of the reactants using an alkaline catalyst such as KOH or NaOH which also influences the estimated yield Mittal et al. 2022 . For efficient biodiesel production the potential of various fast-growing microalgal strains each having growth characteristics and a unique lipid profile is also reported in the literature. Their study provided criteria to select the most appropriate species based on the type of reactor and reaction kinetics which significantly affected the scalability of the biodiesel production process. The reaction kinetics can be controlled by 1 using catalysts and 2 adjusting the mixing intensity to increase the potential yield B. Kim et al. 2019 . Furthermore specific microalgal strains must be considered to understand their potential CO2 uptake rate. Some strains with advanced CO2 uptake like Chlorophyceae Cyanobacteria and Euglenophyceae have considerable carbon sequestration potential. Chlorella vulgaris is best known as a promising strain for biodiesel production because of its high lipid accumulation Durvasula et al. 2015 . In another study different strains were used depending on the culti vation technique Scenedesmus obliquus grew well under both mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions allowing for high productivity with toxic CO2 concentrations Lee et al. 2015 . Likewise Nannochloropsis oculate exhibited a fast growth rate whereas Haematococcus pluvialis produced higher levels of astaxanthin. In another study Neochloris oleoabundans and Nannochloropsis spp. accumulated the highest oil content when exposed to different concentra tions of sodium nitrate Patel et al. 2021 . The researchers Kawale Kishore 2019 reported the pyrolysis results of Oscillatoria to investigate the behavior of the products obtained. In their research TiO2 and ZnO were used as catalysts in a 1 1 ratio in a nitrogen atmosphere at 1 bar and 550 °C. This resulted in a gas-liquid separation that separated the non-condensable gas producing an 87 biodiesel yield through catalytic action. Recent studies have shown that Scenedesmus obliquus can absorb CO2 with better lipid pro duction. Researchers have successfully improved the overall performance of Scenedesmus obliquus using a combination of procedures and strategies that enhanced growth and increased CO2 sequestration which greatly benefits biodiesel production and CO2 removal. In another study researchers targeted biorefining methods for the simultaneous production of biodiesel from different microalgae species. In this regard an exceptional pretreatment strategy using acid hydrolysis was employed to validate the most curative polysaccharides from Scenedesmus sp. to achieve a 90 biomass yield. The researchers Chia et al. 2021 in their study to improve the growth of microalgal strains to produce biodiesel using CO2 from flue gas and wastewater as a nutrient source reported that microalgae have a high capacity to produce biodiesel with an overall efficiency of 87 under the growth conditions of their study. Biodiesel production from microalgae using hydrothermal liquefaction was modeled followed by commercial-scale catalyst upgradation with the extracted biodiesel having a persistence Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology 1257 comparable to that of naphtha and jet fuels. The application of ultrasound in biodiesel produc tion from microalgae has recently been attempted Shrikhande et al. 2021 . On a large scale sonication improves all-switching properties shortens response times and lowers production costs Khan et al. 2021 . However further consideration is required in terms of technical and economic feasibility. The researchers Chang et al. 2020 investigated the continuous production of biodiesel from Chrysophyta and Chlorella sp. in combination with supercritical CO2 extraction lipids were extracted and then processed for final biodiesel production. After decompression the residue could be reused as a raw material for pharmaceutical and nutritional supplements. Observations from these experiments demonstrated that particle size temperature pressure the molar ratio of methanol to oil CO2 absorption capacity and n-hexane affected the trans-esterification bio diesel synthesis process. Another study stressed the strength of the large-scale integration of CO2 fixation sequestration and uptake within microalgal cultivation for biofuel production and environmental benefits in evaluating the economic feasibility of valuable co-product generation Yaashikaa et al. 2023 . 4.3. Biochar Microalgae are considered highly versatile feedstock for producing biochar as they are rich in organic matter. Biochar finds its applicability in various aspects 1 capacity to hold water 2 to enhance the fertility of soil and 3 for retention of nutrients. Thermal conversion processes are involved in the biochar production process. Microalgae must be exposed to high tempera tures typically between 400 and 600 °C when treated in pyrolizers Rajesh Banu et al. 2020 . To produce biochar gasification is a vital process. In this process microalgae are subjected to high temperatures ranging from 600 to 800 °C converting biomass into biochar and gases Aliyu et al. 2021 . The gases produced during the gasification process are effectively used as fuel sources with applicability in transportation processing industries energy production. For thermal conversion of microalgae to biochar the microalgae must be dried to a moisture content of about 10 20 Sarwer et al. 2022 . The optimal time to harvest microalgae is when they have reached maturity under optimal growth conditions and thermal treatment is applied after mois ture content is minimized by centrifugation and filtration as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover an important key step in identifying the suitability of microalgae to produce biochar is their characterization and comparison with biochar derived from terrestrial biomass SundarRajan et al. 2020 . The researchers Bird et al. 2011 provided essential data to evaluate the physi cochemical properties of biochar made from different microalgae strains from fresh brackish and marine environments. Their research used repeated elemental analyses to determine the carbon nitrogen and hydrogen contents using the dry combustion method. The carbonate content was determined by heating at 1000 °C for 1 hr and the organic content was determined at 550 °C for 2 hrs. Additionally the pH cation exchange capacity CEC extracted phosphorus by extraction with bicarbonate electrical conductivity exchangeable bases Na K Mg and Ca and total phosphorus were analyzed. These results were compared with previously published literature and the obtained data was useful to obtain maximum yield conversion on a commercial scale Bora et al. 2024 . Studies have shown that different microalgal strains such as Dunaliella can produce up to 10 g L and Chlorella and Spirulina can produce up to 20 30 g of dry biomass L culture in large-scale production which produces significant quantities of biochar followed by thermal processing Cuevas-Castillo et al. 2020 . In another study various microalgal species were ana lyzed for biochar production. All the species were shortlisted based on various important criteria 1 bioprocessing potential 2 ease of cultivation and 3 adaptability to different environments. Based on these parameters Cladophora Coelothrix Kützing Chaetomorpha Linum Cladophora Patentiramea Cladophoropsis sp. and Chaetomorpha Indica were selected for their study Binda et al. 2020 . All the samples were washed squeezed dry and oven-dried at 65 °C for 48 hrs. 1258 M. A. RASHAD ET AL. After pretreatment at 105 °C microalgae feedstock was loaded into a tubular-type vessel sealed inside a furnace and allowed to cool for 20 min after holding for 60 min. At each temperature three replicates of the microalgae-derived biochar demonstrated more than 3 induced weight loss in all microalga types. They indicated considerable potential for biochar production because it constantly demonstrated desirable characteristics under varying conditions Law et al. 2022 . Recently it was recognized that the CO2 sequestration potential of microalgae-derived biochar is at least 25 greater than that of biochar obtained from other sources of biomass Mona et al. 2021 . By considering the carbon sequestration potential of biochar it was found that biochar pyrolyzed at 500 °C can mitigate up to 380 g L of carbon Mohit Remya 2023 . Low-temperature- derived biochar decomposes faster than high-temperature-derived biochar although the former sequesters more CO2 through decomposition. According to research approximately 10 25 kg of microalgal biomass yields 23 kg of biochar in 1 hr of pyrolysis using a combination with ammo nium bicarbonate. Therefore they are perfect substitutes for fertilizers because they provide a substrate for enhancing microbial activity De Bhowmick Sarmah 2020 . 5. Microalgal potential for capturing carbon dioxide Given the current state of the environment worldwide finding ways to mitigate CO2 emissions which contribute significantly to global warming and climate change is vital. Microalgae used for capturing CO2 sequester enormous amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere and help reduce the overall atmospheric concentration of CO2. Microalgae can capture CO2 from soluble car bonates air smokestacks and industrial exhaust because they adapt to different conditions Sanchez et al. 2015 . 5.1. Factors affecting microalgal absorption of CO2 The researchers Verma et al. 2020 concluded that photoautotrophic strains of microalgae accumulate CO2 10 50 times more efficiently than terrestrial plants because of their extraordinary FIG. 4. Microalgal CO2 sequestration different production processes and products obtained. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology 1259 ability to fix CO2. This capacity of microalgae to absorb CO2 can be exploited for preventing environmental emissions by introducing CO2-rich flue gas from industrial facilities or power plants into ponds or photobioreactors using flue gas bubbling systems designed to mix the flue gas with microalgal cultures H. M. Singh et al. 2019 . CO2 tolerance varies from species to species Chlorella vulgaris shows the highest growth at 5 v v CO2 concentration but its growth is inhibited at 15 v v CO2 Mittal et al. 2022 . The most promising microalgal strains for CO2 sequestration are Nannochloropsis oculata Chlorella vulgaris Botryococcus braunii and Scenedesmus obliquus Kandasamy et al. 2022 . In addition to the influence of microalgal cul tivation systems CO2 fixation by microalgae is affected by physicochemical parameters during growth. Usually microalgae growth at moderate CO2 concentrations is inhibited by acidification. Many microalgal processes cannot be scaled up efficiently because of the failure to recycle resources by reusing wastewater phosphates and nitrates during the cultivation stage Chu et al. 2021 . Another factor is the energy and resources required for microalgal cultivation such as water nutrients and light which can strain local resources and contribute to environmental degradation. The pH of the microalgae cultivation medium significantly regulates nutrient uptake photo synthetic efficiency and carbon sequestration with pH 6.5 8.5 being optimal for satisfactory growth Herold et al. 2021 . However a slightly alkaline pH benefits higher CO2 absorption because an alkali increases the CO2 supply within the cultivation medium. Bicarbonate HCO3 is also a carbon carrier within the inorganic cultivation medium. By carbonic anhydrase HCO3 can be converted to OH increasing pH and eventually changing the equilibrium of various inorganic carbon species Kupriyanova et al. 2023 . It is well known that exhaust gas containing excessive CO2 10 20 vol. acidifies the algal cultivation and suppresses algal growth. Temperature is an essential element for increasing and improving photosynthesis in organ isms. The optimum temperature for growth varies from species to species and the optimal temperature for Nannochloropsis is 293 K and Chlorella vulgaris is 303 K Brindhadevi et al. 2021 . Low temperatures inhibit carbon sequestration in microalgae by decreasing the enzymatic activity of carboxylase five-bisphosphate Rubisco and ribulose-1 these enzymes play an essential role in photorespiration and photosynthesis. However high temperatures alter photo respiration and metabolic activity Shan et al. 2023 . The adverse effects of temperature on microalgae are visible above 313 K which includes partial inactivation of oxygen-evolving potential. Temperature is inversely related to CO2 dissolution inside the liquid medium whereby an increase in temperature reduces CO2 dissolution in the algal cultivation medium Y. W. Cheng et al. 2021 . In addition low- and high-light intensities alter photosynthetic mechanisms. Table 2 presents details of several microalgae strains and their responses to CO2. Two strains Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis oculata have shown high CO2 fixation rates 0.49 g L d and 0.39 g L d respectively contributing to their strong CO2 removal efficiency 92.1 and 67 . In contrast Chlorococcum littorale and Haematococcus pluvialis demonstrated lower fixation rates 0.13 g L d and 0.143 g L d because of limitations in their growth. The available data Table 2 demonstrates the necessity of enhancing less successful strains and the ability of some microalgae to sequester CO2 efficiently. 5.2. Challenges Despite the significant progress in using microalgae for CO2 capture several limitations must be overcome to fully realize the potential of this technology. One of the primary limitations of microalgal technology is the lack of economically viable commercial methods for harvesting microalgal biomass at a steady-state scale. Various biological contaminants such as predators along with parasitic fungi and other microorganisms diminish sustainable microalgae cultivation by causing significant reductions in biomass. Recent studies focus on developing techniques which address these problems in microalgae cultivation. Studies have shown that sodium 1260 M. A. RASHAD ET AL. dodecylbenzene sulfonate SDBS applied at 10 mg L concentration effectively controls predatory flagellates alongside ciliates populations in Chlorella mass cultures Nordio et al. 2024 . The implementation of synthetic chemicals is associated with various problems i.e. they harm the environment as well as pose risks to unintended species. The increasing interest in plant-derived pesticides occurs because these substances represent a sustainable alternative to conventional synthetic pesticides El-Sheekh et al. 2025 . Pulsed electric fields PEF represent one of the multiple physical methods which researchers are testing to eliminate protozoan contaminants specifically. PEF treatment of industrial photobioreactors decreased active protozoan numbers by 87 during 6 hrs of operating time before eliminating all protozoa within several days without affecting microalgal growth rates Paladino Neviani 2025 . There are also some chemical barriers to the utilization of CO2 streams Chia et al. 2021 . Both sulfur dioxide SO2 and nitrogen compounds such as oxides NOx can be unfavorable to microalgae growth productivity and even the pH of the microalgal growth medium. The streams of CO2 also contain other chemical factors such as Pb Cd and Hg which can alter algal metabolic pathways Chia et al. 2018 . The wastewater streams containing heavy metals and nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing compounds such as nitrite NO2 ammonia NH3 and nitrate NO3 alongside various industrial effluents pose a serious risk toward the quality of water and can even suppress some microorganisms Ahmed et al. 2022 . Not all the metals are harmful as they can assist in cell growth but the media in which these cultures are grown possess a certain concentration of these heavy metals to aid in growth which can be challenging Cheah et al. 2015 Zhao et al. 2023 . The high cost of producing and maintaining photobioreactors and the associated equipment to provide sufficient light and nutrients to support microalgal growth can limit their use in certain regions Zuccaro et al. 2020 . Additionally the photosynthetic processes of microalgae depend on mass transfer temperature regulation and natural reactions Mohamadnia et al. 2022 Wu et al. 2023 . Currently various approaches are used including physical and organic shift methods each under specific conditions for CO2 fixation Sarwer et al. 2022 . The impact of temperature pH and light on CO2 fixation rates particularly under foaming conditions has been investigated with a focus on CO2 absorption in various experimental conditions. A note worthy gap exists between thermodynamic and kinetic studies Sathya et al. 2023 . This defi ciency undermines the empirical basis of the experimental results impeding industrial design and control efforts which is a major commercial challenge. Table 2.

Life cycle assessment LCA Concerning microalgal biofuels the LCA discussion focuses on large-scale energy generation especially nutrient supplies cultivation resources energy inputs water use nitrogen and phos phorus constraints and the life cycle of other materials products and by-products involved in the process of biofuel production by sequestering carbon Moradiya Marathe 2023 . By examining the environmental implications of biofuels produced from microalgae and their effec tiveness for utilization as zero-carbon solution several LCAs have assessed cultivation and inventories S. Li et al. 2023 . A comprehensive life cycle analysis is conducted by Saranya and Ramachandra from cradle to grave Saranya Ramachandra 2020 . The cradle-to-grave analysis demonstrated that GHGs can be reduced to 80 by using microalgal biofuels instead of using conventional fuels. However this efficacy is linked with higher energy requirements for culti vation and processing. Cultivation harvesting and conversion processes play a key role while doing the life cycle assessment LCA of biofuels based on microalgae for important parameters i.e. energy and CO2 sequestration. S. Li et al. 2023 . Microalgae play a vital role in the uptake of nutrients and to produce energy and their nutritional requirements are affected by stressors that affect carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Across different strains and under ambient normal conditions the phosphorus and nitrogen requirements vary ranging from 2.5 2.6 to 11 70.7 g kg respec tively Gumbi et al. 2022 . To increase these nutrients and to minimize the requirements of energy partial or complete utilization of wastewater can also be made Maktabifard et al. 2023 . Various parameters affect the results produced from life cycle analysis 1 cultivation location 2 species 3 methodologies etc. de Assis et al. 2023 . Through specialized cultivation setups production rates can reach remarkable levels ranging from 100 to 1536 g m3 per day Wimmerova et al. 2022 . Various methods are used to supply CO2 for microalgal cultivation which are aimed at saving energy Kazemi et al. 2023 . The direct injection of flue gas into the culture medium without prior enrichment or pressurization with substantial gas compression impacts efficiency with lower energy requirements. This method reduces the utilization of gasoline or fuels for trans portation and eventually the environmental impacts and costs associated with gas purification and transportation. This method involves drying the biomass to a moisture content ranging from 50 to 98 of the dry mass before co-burning S. Li et al. 2023 . The environmental impact of this approach depends on whether the heat required for biomass drying is derived from flue gas recovery Braud et al. 2023 . A comparative LCA study using two cultivation methods showed that net energy gain and CO2 sequestration efficiency were higher for the photobioreactor cultivation 3.12 MJ MJ as compared to the open pond 2.26 MJ MJ Pankratz et al. 2020 . The total energy input for cultivation is about 2476 MJ m2 y less than the energy requirement for ethanol production from corn 3335 MJ m2 y Mat Aron et al. 2020 . Besides studies have revealed lower land require ments for microalgal culturing compared to other biofuel crops due to their high productivity. In this context the researchers Morales et al. 2019 reviewed renewable sources of electricity like wind and solar which can be a considerable source of reduction in environmental impacts. The study indicates the fact that net energy gain from biofuel production is more likely than that in the case of renewable electricity use. It can help diminish GHGs and fossil fuel depletion by 70 Shelare et al. 2023 . Different microalgal strains have altered features such as growth rate nutrient requirements lipid content among others. This means that the comprehensive bioenergy and CO2 analysis of the biofuels is different. In a study six strains were analyzed and LCA was done. The net energy gain was observed to be 0.24 3.72 MJ MJ while CO2 cap ture efficiency was 0.11 0.23 kg CO2 kg biodiesel performing better than fossil fuels Collotta et al. 2017 . The researchers Xue et al. 2021 scrutinized LCA using Chlorella sp. Scenedesmus sp. and Nannochloropsis sp. They found that the energy consumption and environmental impacts of cultivation and conversion were higher for Nannochloropsis sp. than for Chlorella sp. and 1262 M. A. RASHAD ET AL. Scenedesmus sp. However the CO2 capture efficiency was higher for Chlorella sp. than for Nannochloropsis sp and Scenedesmus sp. 7. Techno-economic analysis TEA The techno-economic assessment of microalgae-based biofuels is of utmost importance since it measures the economic value of various methods of biomass growing harvesting and converting into fuel. The researchers Hoang et al. 2023 argue that significant capital and operational expenses pose major boundaries toward the TEA of microalgae biofuels. As shown in Table 3 various researchers have demonstrated that microalgae cultivation comes with a heavy infra structural cost. The energetic region of cultivating water-harvesting and processing of microalgae and biochar adds up to the total productive cost thus creates an economic challenge. In turn bioeconomic viability is largely reliant on how inexpensive these practices are and how profitable enhanced co-products like protein and biochar fertilizer from microalgal biomass are Venkata Subhash et al. 2022 . More recently biochar derived from microorganisms has been demonstrated to serve as an organic soil amendment synergistically with other biofertilizers and as food sup plementation. Further it contributes to economic benefits while making investments through the use of microalgae-based biofuel economically feasible Arora et al. 2021 Llamas et al. 2021 . Several TEA approaches have been proposed including deterministic models sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations Batan et al. 2016 Das Kumar 2022 Van Schoubroeck et al. 2021 . The researchers Lim et al. 2022 suggested that deterministic models help evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different biofuels as alternatives to conventional fossil fuels and their production. At the same time Monte Carlo simulations were reported to be more appropriate for assessing the overall economic risk associated with large-scale commercialization Bhatt et al. 2022 Gutiérrez Ortiz 2020 . One of the critical prospects for improving economic feasibility is the development of biorefineries for large-scale production. Several innovative approaches have been proposed including using wastewater as a nutrient source using photobioreactors for high-density cultivation and using flocculants for low-cost harvesting. In addition the availability of substructures such as storage facilities and transportation networks and economic factors such as the price of feedstock and energy inputs affect the economics of biofuel production. The researchers Roles et al. 2021 used commercial and pilot plant data to study biofuel production s economic provisions. A distinct model was used to calculate productivity and an alternative model was used to calculate the energy efficiency of the three selected facilities from 1 to 4 with a maximum potential of 9 . The coefficient of direct energy consumption was 0.06 whereas that of indirect energy consumption was 0.74. In their study the supply of CO2 harvest pump energy nitrogen supply costs total capital costs and overheads were calculated which affected the energy consumption and ultimately increased the cost of the end product. However potential improvements to reduce energy consumption costs are vital increased annual productivity direct flue gas use wastewater use reduced equip ment size installation costs and reduced labor and management costs. Researchers pointed out that biofuels from microalgae face economic hurdles and the pro duction process becomes less economically viable yet combining valuable bioproduct outputs makes the production system financially viable Stephy et al. 2025 . The production of biofuels biohydrogen and various high-value products from microalgae supports the development of a circular bioeconomy system. Scientists are applying synthetic biology advancements to upgrade microalgae strains with improvements in the cultivation processes increasing revenue streams to fulfill the market potential beyond economic hurdles Novia et al. 2025 . According to the latest study the U.S. could maximize microalgae biomass production to 152 million tons annually while effectively using 268 million tons of CO2 per year for biofuel production at scale. The combination of biofuels with high-value compound extraction through a biorefinery method clutches for increasing microalgae-based biofuels economic sustainability Kashif et al. 2025 .

Several TEA studies have been conducted to compare the feasibility of biofuels derived from microalgae with those derived from other biomass and conventional fuels Fu et al. 2023 Kargbo et al. 2021 Ranjbari et al. 2022 . A U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory report estimated the average price of algal biodiesel to be 2.11 L significantly higher than that of soybean biodiesel and corn bioethanol Nagarajan et al. 2013 . However promoting renewable energy and achieving carbon reduction goals can positively affect the viability of these ventures. Furthermore biodiesel production rates would be more competitive than petroleum diesel if renewable energy could be used in parallel with solar power for harvesting and lipid extraction Severo et al. 2019 . The cost-effectiveness of studying the potential of 288 microalgal farms in producing biodiesel and bioethanol within the European Union was examined. The results indi cated that biofuels have the lowest nonpublic value for road transport in Europe and given that CO2 sequestration in growing algae is a significant burden the risks of equity issues were raised at a high price Moreira et al. 2021 . 8. Conclusions and future implications After a thorough analysis of microalgae as a low-carbon feedstock for carbon sequestration and biofuel production it was evident that it has the potential to aid in reaching a zero-carbon solution while also supporting a sustainable and renewable bio-circular economy. Nonetheless efficient cultivation and processing techniques must be developed to make microalgae-based biofuels profitable. Microalgae are classified as a high potential source for GHG mitigation because of their high lipid content high growth rate and carbon capture utilization and storage abilities. The financial viability of industrial production of biofuels is determined by the capital costs production costs and the biofuels market. The microalgae biofuel environmental sustain ability should also address the impacts of the cultivation and processing methods employed. The adoption of a bio-circular economy model where the waste from microalgae-based fuel production and carbon capture processes is used for other industrial processes can mitigate environmental impacts and create new revenue streams. Furthermore the necessity to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change should not be ignored. More benign and ecolog ically sound solutions are possible due to advanced technologies that involve the use of microalgae as carbon sinks during biofuel production. However further developments and improvements are necessary to make these options low-cost and long-term. High-yield cultivation techniques genetic engineering strain development bioreactor design isolation technologies and metabolic engineering are significant advancements that require further focus. Further research and devel opment in this area can pave the way for a sustainable zero-carbon future and reduce the impact of climate change on the economy environment and current and future energy systems.

Primary causes are the high reliance on fossil fuels for power generation transportation manufacturing and the intensive land usage deforestation . The current share of renewable biofuel production in the overall fuel demand has been found insufﬁcient to replace fossil fuels. Microalgae can deliver a sustainable and complementary biofuel platform with some important advantages. This review aims to offer a state-of-the art review of algal biomass conversion methods into various biofuel products including biodiesel syngas biogas bioethanol. Emerging more sustainable biofuel bioenergy production technologies are highlighted.

Introduction The interference of anthropogenic activities in biogeochemical cycles and the extensive use of fossil fuels are the primary cause of the imminent global climate change. This scenario is expected to further deteriorate in the coming years since the human popula- tion is expected to increase up to 9 billion by 2050 Godfray et al. 2010 . Goli et al. 2016 recently reported that around 87 of the global CO2 emitted by anthropogenic activities result from the us- age of fossil resources with coal oil and natural gas contributing 43 36 and 20 respectively. It has therefore become crucial to reduce the carbon emission by using sustainable energy resources on a global scale but integrated at local scale. Over the last decade biomass has drawn increasing attention in our society as a source of bioenergy and bioproducts. Various biomass sources including ﬁrst second third and fourth generation feedstocks such as edible and non-edible energy crops wood agricultural residues and algae have been exploited so far for the development of bioenergy pro- duction methods. 1.1. Microalgae vs. plants Microalgae derived biomass exhibits some important advan- tages over plant derived biomass Naik et al. 2010 Lam and Lee 2012 Rawat et al. 2013 . Most importantly microalgae do not depend on fertile land availability and in many cases they can be grown in wastewater or in seawater. Typically the production of 1 kg of microalgae biomass requires 1.83 kg of CO2 Chisti 2007 . Compared to plants microalgae have in general higher photosyn- thetic efﬁciencies. They convert ca. 3e8 of the solar energy during cellular metabolism against 0.5 typically for terrestrial crops. Microalgae can exhibit exceptional fast growth rates and can be produced more continuously as compared to plants. Microalgae derived biomass is typically enriched in lipids ca. 4.5e7.5 ton ha 1 y 1 Tsukahara and Sawayama 2005 compared to soybean 0.4 ton ha 1 y 1 rapeseed 0.7 ton ha 1 y 1 Chisti 2007 and jatropha 4.1 ton ha 1 y 1 Lam and Lee 2011 .

In these aspects microalgae bioreﬁnery can clearly contribute to environmental social and economic more sustainable biofuel production systems. 1.2. From ﬁrst to fourth generation biofuels Most of the current biofuels are produced from the grains of edible crops via a wide range of processes which include Brown and Brown 2013 Lee and Wilson 2015 fermentation using yeast strains bioethanol bio catalytic transesteriﬁcation bio- diesel and chemical solid acid base catalysts. Lü et al. 2011 demonstrated how the cultivation of edible crops for ﬁrst genera- tion biofuels can have detrimental effects on food security induce deforestation and show poor energy balances. They also require fresh water fertilizers and a vast area of arable land area for their cultivation. This can even result in a further increase of net carbon emissions Gonz alez et al. 2015 . Besides the excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers in such open cultivation systems arable land can lead to the accumulation of harmful contaminants into the atmosphere volatile organic compounds ammonia and nitrous oxide and in groundwater non-volatile organic compounds ni- trates and phosphates . Lignocellulosic materials as second gener- ation feedstock can address this fuel vs. food dilemma. Still especially at large scales biofuel production the transport of biomass and the development of cost-effective pretreatment and conversion methods make that today s commercial second gener- ation biofuel production remains limited. The third and fourth generation biofuel production entails algae-to-biofuels technol- ogy whereas the former deals with the conversion process itself from microalgae to biofuels the latter sets the focus on the development of microalgal biotechnology via metabolic engineer- ing of microalgae genomes Lü et al. 2011 Dutta et al. 2014 in which genetic material is altered in a speciﬁc and selective manner to co-opt photoautotrophic algal strains which may lead to the maximization of the biofuel yield and or minimization of the associated process costs. Currently various studies demonstrated promising results related to increased carbon capture capacity biomass production and lipid accumulation after successful incor- poration of the adapted genomes in microalgae cells Dutta et al. 2014 Levitan et al. 2014 Beacham et al. 2017 Shumbulo and Ki 2018 . The role of algae based biotechnology may become very important for biofuel production and to make the overall conver- sion more cost-effective and sustainable. In addition recently solid waste particularly municipal solid waste MSW often containing solid materials such as plastics paper food scraps textiles card- boad and wood materials has been considered by Boesch et al. 2014 and Arena et al. 2015 as a potential source for sustain- able energy production and recovery of valuable resources. The main advantage of using MSW is their wide and abundant avail- ability throughout the year and they are very low cost Aracil et al. 2017 . 1.3. Microalgae bioreﬁnery Analog to lignocellulose microalgae based bioreﬁnery aims to develop sustainable production technologies of bioenergy and bioproducts including chemicals fuels and even food or animal feed and is actually Gonz alez et al. 2015 a very attractive research ﬁeld Fig. 1 . Microalgae are rich in lipids carbohydrates and proteins primary metabolites but also can contain consid- erable amounts of secondary metabolites and minerals. That is why actually different bioreﬁnery schemes are considered Rizwan et al. 2015 depending on the target product. Ruiz et al. 2016 recently demonstrated how important to is to distinguish production sys- tems at high scale bio-energy and biofuels and at low scale high added-value products HVPs . Techno-economic assessment studies have shown better projections for the near future for the production of high-value products in optimized conditions pro- teins and secondary metabolite production as compared to large scale biofuel production scenarios lipids in optimal growth con- ditions. An important technical constraint is the fact that up-scaling of microalgae cultivation methods often occurs in modular units which means that the cost reduction is rather low economy of scale effect . Data on production costs on larger scale are rather limited and the uncertainty on the projections is high as demon- strated already some time ago by Sun et al. 2011 and addressed again more recently by Laurens et al. 2017 . Further decreasing the algae biomass production costs cultivation is one of the chal- lenges for the near future. Biomass production efﬁciencies highly depend on algae strain CO2 supply light regime and nutrient feeding Vanthoor-Koopmans et al. 2013 Aravantinou and Manariotis 2016 . Further studies in this research ﬁeld similar to Doucha et al. 2005 Langley et al. 2012 and Wilson et al. 2014 are highly desirable to locate the optimal distance from the ﬂue gas point source to maximize the carbon capture capacity and the biomass production yield while sustaining the stability of the algal culture in function of the pollutant nutrient concentrations tem- perature pH and light intensity proﬁles and minimizing the transport puriﬁcation and storage costs of the ﬂue gases. Recently many efforts are reported to use municipal agricultural and in- dustrial wastewater sources to recover valuable nutrients from these streams especially phosphor and nitrogen nutrients for the production of fourth generation algal biofuels Cho et al. 2011 Kesaano and Sims 2014 Komolafe et al. 2014 Chen et al. 2015a Quiroz Arena et al. 2015 Luo et al. 2017 . Next to algae cultiva- tion itself harvesting the biomass produced in suspension is also part of the bottleneck as it contributes considerably in the overall biomass production cost Naghdi et al. 2016 . The harvesting and dewatering of microalgae biomass reaches up to 50 of the total biomass production cost Mata et al. 2010 Sahoo et al. 2017 . The key methods currently used in the harvesting of microalgae include ﬂocculation centrifugation ﬁltration gravity sedimentation elec- trophoresis ﬂotation and combinations of these. So far Vandamme et al. 2013 proposed aggregation through ﬂocculation and coag- ulation as the most cost-effective microalgae harvesting alterna- tive. Centrifugation should be considered as a ﬁnal stage dewatering step as centrifugation technologies face large initial capital investments and considerable operational costs Dassey and Theegala 2013 . Aggregation through the production of microbial Fig. 1. Microalgae bioreﬁnery concept for bio-energy and biofuel production. A. Raheem et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 181 2018 42e59 43 pellets in cultivar consortia with fungi and bacteria bio- ﬂocculation is another route considered to enable efﬁcient sepa- ration of microalgae cells Zhou et al. 2012 Muradov et al. 2015 . Moreover the development of such microbial consortia can enable higher biofuel production yields through metabolic symbiosis be- tween respiring bacteria fungi yeasts and photosynthesizing microalgae and also important could open the pathway to the use of lignocellulosic feedstocks which are not available for pure algal cultures Gomez et al. 2016 . Despite these important advances natural harvesting methods such as simple gravity ﬁltration and solar drying should be further optimized on larger scales to make microalgae harvesting and drying more environmentally friendly and more cost-effective. Other important contributors in the cost breakdown analysis are pretreatments required to improve sub- sequent extraction steps . Conventional pretreatments such as milling pressing sonication homogenizers mechanical and os- motic shock or cell lysis with acid base chemical can result in high costs especially when multiple steps are required Rizwan et al. 2015 Ruiz et al. 2016 . Also important in bio-reﬁnery schemes are the development of valorization methods for co-products. The applications of mild separation methods which do not imply high pressure and solvents are signiﬁcant for the production of the desired compounds without damaging other fractions Vanthoor- Koopmans et al. 2013 . 2. Research methodology This review aims to resume the up-to-date progress on micro- algae conversion methods and recent developments in the ﬁeld of fourth generation biofuel production systems. In the ﬁrst stage of the research insight was attained in all aspects of microalgae bio- reﬁnery based on reviews from the past and on recent works which report signiﬁcant progress in different areas. This in-depth study of the literature available on microalgae has showed us very clearly on a cost breakdown analysis basis that improvements are needed in nearly all bioreﬁnery areas including cultivation harvesting extraction and conversion methods. Nevertheless it was also concluded that new emerging strategies are currently being considered to overcome some limitations and to provide more sustainable production systems. These ﬁndings are the guideline of this review. The ﬁrst part describes thermochemical and biochemical conversion technologies for the production of bio- energy and biofuels. The second part describes emerging biofuels and technologies. Special attention is also paid to wastewater treatment and bioremediation to capture CO2 phosphorus P and nitrogen N from industrial agricultural and municipal sources. Finally the importance of microalgae biotechnology for the development of microalgae bioreﬁnery is highlighted. 3. Microalgae biofuel production Microalgae derived biomass can be converted into biofuels via four pathways thermochemical conversion Raheem et al. 2015 biochemical conversion transesteriﬁcation and photosynthetic microbial fuel cell processes Naik et al. 2010 . Thermo-chemical conversion technologies utilize heat and catalysts to convert algal biomass into intermediate products which are further converted into biofuels via chemical and biological routes. Biochemical con- version technologies involve the utilization of micro-organisms or enzymes for the hydrolysis of pretreated biomass to obtain fermentable sugars. Biochemical processing of biomass to biofuels is often more selective and greener but is associated with higher production costs as compared to thermochemical processing Brennan and Owende 2010 . The development of a suitable con- version approach is one of the key challenges for the economic viability and the sustainability of biofuel production. 3.1. Thermo-chemical conversion Thermo-chemical conversion involves a combination of thermal breakdown and chemical reformation of the organic constitutes into biofuels via gasiﬁcation pyrolysis hydrothermal liquefaction and combustion. Table 1 resumes the operating conditions of thermo-chemical conversion methods. Next to a conversion method for whole algae feedstocks thermo-chemical technologies also hold an important valorization way for co-products in biofuel production systems. One example is the valorization of defatted residue remaining after conversion to biodiesel via trans- esteriﬁcation Mutanda et al. 2011 . This residual algae biomass is mainly comprised of proteins carbohydrates and unutilized lipids which can be utilized to produce gaseous and liquid biofuels and biochar depending on the experimental conditions used Pradhan et al. 2017 . 3.1.1. Pyrolysis The pyrolysis of algae biomass is usually done at elevated tem- peratures ranging from 300 to 700 C but may accomplished at lower temperatures when a catalyst is present. To isolate the oils the generated vapours need to condensed by cooling leaving behind a solid residue char . The amounts of gas oil and char isolated from algae biomass can vary considerably Table 2 . Recent studies pointed out that algae based pyrolysis oils may have slightly lower caloric values but higher stability than lignocellulose derived oils Babich et al. 2011 Campanella et al. 2012 Chaiwong et al. 2013 Chiaramonti et al. 2017 Du et al. 2011 Wang et al. 2013a . But it still contains chemically dissolved water solids and substantial amounts of nitrogen containing compounds which requires catalytic upgrading via cracking and hydrogenation to remove them. The heating rate is an important parameter during pyrolysis. Common methods include slow pyrolysis 0.1e1 C s 1 fast pyrolysis 10e200 C s 1 and ﬂash pyrolysis 1000 C s 1 . Slow pyrolysis is easier to carry out but in general lower oil yields with some exceptions are obtained and with different composi- tions Campanella et al. 2012 Chaiwong et al. 2013 Wang et al. 2013a . Important amounts of long carbon chain compounds with an oxygen content ca. 30 wt were found in the bio-oil with a Table 1 Operational conditions of thermo-chemical conversion methods Brennan and Owende 2010 Naik et al. 2010 Raheem et al. 2015 .

The gaseous product consists mostly of CH4 and CO2 Vardon et al. 2012 . Heat exchangers can be used to recover en- ergy from the gaseous product to dry the algae feedstock or for heating the pyrolysis chamber which both demand a considerable energy input. Fast pyrolysis can reduce the amount of biochar Dickerson and Soria 2013 . Important differences were found between algae biomass from phototrophic and heterotrophic C. prothothecoides cultures. While in the former a bio-oil with 12 MJ kg 1 HHV was isolated a 3.4 times higher HHV value was measured for the heterotrophically grown algae derived bio-oil Miao and Wu 2004 . Demirbas also used C. prothothecoides biomass and found the bio-oil yield to increase with temperature 6e55 from 255 to 500 C with HHV 40 MJ kg 1 Demirbas 2006 . Flash pyrolysis drastically increases the amount of liquid product even exceeding 90 . 3.1.2. Gasiﬁcation Gasiﬁcation is a versatile chemical technology that accepts a wide range of carbon feedstocks. The process involves partial oxidation with controlled amounts of air oxygen or steam at 700e1000 C producing a mixture of gases known as syngas mainly composed of H2 CO CO2 and CH4 . Syngas has a low caloriﬁc value of 4e6 MJ m 3 and is mainly suitable as a fuel for heating gas engines and turbines electricity generation . It can also be rearranged to produce hydrogen via water-gas-shift WGS reaction and liquid hydrocarbon fuels via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis such as methanol gasoline and diesel fuels Sanchez-Silva et al. 2013 Sutton et al. 2001 . The WGS reaction can be optimized to produce H2 enriched syngas by employing sorption enhanced reforming Naik et al. 2010 Raheem et al. 2017 . Hirano et al. 1998 gasiﬁed Spirulina at 850e1000 C and obtained up to 0.64 g methanol g 1 biomass. The overall energy balance was ca. 1 1 ratio of methanol energy produced to the total required en- ergy . When using steam for the gasiﬁcation of Nannochlorophsis gaditana the product got enriched in H2 CO and CO2 and depleted in CH4 as the WGS process shifted and methane reforming became prominent Sanchez-Silva et al. 2013 . Microalgae biomass can also be co-feeded with coal for gasiﬁ- cation Kucukvar and Tatari 2011 Qadi et al. 2017 . However microalgae with high ash content are not recommended to avoid accumulation. Yang et al. 2013 compared the co-gasiﬁcation of Spirulina platensis pellets with wood pellets using a bubbling ﬂu- idized bed reactor. Closer to 1 1 feed ratios the product became enriched in CO2 and CO. The ash content in microalgae pellets were found to be higher as compared to woody biomass pellets which may cause sintering in the gasiﬁcation Asadullah 2014 . In some cases ash can contain catalytic active particles. L opez-Gonz alez et al. 2014 studied the steam gasiﬁcation of Scenedesmus almer- iensis Nannochloropsis gaditana and Chlorella vulgaris at analytical scale TGA-MS . The main products from the gasiﬁcation were CO2 H2 CO and smaller amounts of CH4 C2H2 and C2H5. Scenedesmus almeriensis showed the highest gasiﬁcation yields attributed to its higher content of catalytic elements such as K and Mg. The gas mixture was entriched in H2 favored by the WGS reaction and steam reforming. In the presence of Ru TiO2 catalyst C. vulgaris was completely gasiﬁed at 700 C Chakinala et al. 2009 . The gas mixture was enriched in H2 ca. 10 mol per kg algae at a gasiﬁcation efﬁciency of 85 . Nickel based catalysts dolomite and potassium carbonate are other examples of catalyst assisted gasiﬁcation Patil et al. 2008 . Finally air is by far the cheapest gasifying agent but it causes increased tar formation. Khoo et al. 2013 gasiﬁed Nanno- chloropsis sp. in a ﬁxed bed gasiﬁer at 850 C and obtained 59 wt char tar 28 wt syngas and 14 wt bio-oil. By increasing the ﬂow rate char tar formation can be surpressed to some extent. An overview of results obtained from co- gasiﬁcation of algae is shown in Table 3. 3.1.3. Hydrothermal liquefaction HTL After the cultivation the obtained microalgae slurries are designated for harvesting. These slurries have high moisture con- tent ca. 70e80 which is one of the key obstacles in algae based processing related to the high energy input for pumping dew- atering e.g. centrifugation and drying of the biomass Chen et al. 2015b . As hydrothermal liquefaction HTL occurs in water extensive dewatering processes are avoided Chiaramonti et al. 2017 . This advantage has led to a tremendous expansion in HTL research for the last 5 years Elliott 2016 Saber et al. 2016 . Table 2 Oil gas and char yields from pyrolysis of different algae species.

During liquefaction some compounds are extracted from the biomass others are depolymerized to oligomers and monomers followed by further decomposition through cleavage dehydration decarboxylation and deamination to produce small unstable fragments which rearrange by condensation and cyclization to form new com- pounds. Carbohydrates can rearrange to aromatics and proteins to piperidine pyrrole and amide compounds while TAG are mostly hydrolysed to fatty acids Raza 2014 . Although Duan and Savage 2010 achieved higher HTL oil yields compared to pyrolysis bio- oil the product mixture is very complex containing numerous compounds from which some of them are illustrated in Fig. 2 Sudasinghe et al. 2014 .

Journal of Cleaner Production 181 2018 42e59 46 diesel and has similar characteristics such as HHV cetane number ﬂash point and kinematic viscosity Azadi et al. 2014 Singh and Olsen 2011 . The standards used for biodiesel quality are ASTM D6751 American and EN 14 214 European . FAME can be pro- duced from oleo rich crop derived oils with yields ranging between 5 and 100 m3 oil ha 1 year 1. They can also be produced from FA rich waste streams e.g. cooking oils. High oil yields can also be isolated from microalgae with minimum land usage as illustrated in Table 5. At ﬁrst sight the high lipid content in microalgae makes them a potentially appealing source for biodiesel production. However high microalgal biomass production cost e.g. depending on the type of photobioreactor scalabality limited growth rates and the need of applying environmental stress to enhance lipid production are the key bottlenecks for industrial scale biodiesel production from algae Lü et al. 2011 . The stress control is typically established by monitoring the growth parameter conditions such as temperature pH phoshate and nitrogen contents etc. to regu- late microalgal cells from growth regime to stress regime to induce high lipid secretion for their adaption to the varying environment Savage et al. 2008 . Two main microalgae cultivation systems exist open ponds OPs and photo-bioreactors PBRs . PBRs inherently offer better control and highter productivity compared to OPs. Nevertheless PBRs incur higher cost in terms of installation operation and maintenance compared to OPs. Albeit OPs are cost- effective easier to construct and to operate they have to deal with poor light utilization evaporative losses and susceptibility to microbial contamination. Advances in microalgal cultivation sys- tems may not only improve the quality composition and produc- tivity of the algal biomass upstream but also may have profound effects on downsteam process technology and its associated costs . A recent technoeconomic study has shown that bringing down the biodiesel production costs to a level that would facilitate commercialization is exceptionally challenging Ruiz et al. 2016 . Future research and development will not only persuade im- provements in down-stream processing but also upstream wards e.g. through enhancing biodiesel production yield via recombinant DNA technology . Some algae species contain signiﬁcant amounts of TAG varying between 25 and 77 on dry cell weight which is remarkably higher than that of oleo enriched terrestrial crops Chisti 2007 . The TAG feedstocks with chain length of C15-C22 and low unsaturation level are most suitable for biodiesel production. The FA composition of many microalgae species exhibit this chain length however the extent of unsaturation can be an obstacle in certain species as it can negatively affect oxidative stability heat of combustion and cetane number Williams and Laurens 2010 .

A. Raheem et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 181 2018 42e59 47 transesteriﬁcation in supercritical methanol Patil et al. 2011 Wahlen et al. 2011 while in conventional homogenous biodiesel production polar lipids can affect the processing and quality of the biodiesel Liu et al. 2011 . Biodiesel production with acid or base catalysts in homogeneous phase employs a two-step method oil extraction using solvents followed by transesteriﬁcation resulting in high water consumption and energy input. Table 6 shows the process conditions catalyst and yields obtained from biodiesel production in homogeneous phase from various algae species via transesteriﬁcation. Acid-catalyzed transesteriﬁcations are less sensitive to the presence of water and free FA and therefore mitigate saponiﬁcation and emulsiﬁcation risks enhancing the product recovery Xu and Mi 2011 . Though acid catalysts have these advantages they are currently not preferred due to their lower activity compared to alkaline catalysts. Higher temperatures and longer reaction times are therefore generally required. Nevertheless acid catalysts are more applicable to the transesteriﬁcation of different lipid feed- stocks. For this reason heterogeneous acid catalyts are currently being developed. Sulfated and non-sulfated zirconia as Lewis acids and sulfonic groups as Br onsted acid groups are among the most active catalyst centers for both TAG hydrolysis and FA esteriﬁcation Lee and Wilson 2015 Luque and Clark 2011 . Heteropolyacids such as H3PW12O40 also have shown promising results as solid acids while Mg-Al hydrotalcites and doped transition metal oxides as solid bases. Recently the focus is set on the development of porous hierachical ordered catalysts due to the bulky and viscous character of the substrates for operation at lower temperatures. Progress in the use of plug-ﬂow reactors using heterogeneous catalysts have shown recently their advantage compared to conventional ﬁxed bed column reactors especially in the use of multiple feedstocks for the production of biodiesel Dimian and Rothenberg 2016 . In situ transesteriﬁcation in contrast is a single-step concept which avoids the costly dewatering drying or oil extraction steps from living algal cells. The supercritical extraction process of lipids can be coupled with a transesteriﬁcation reaction to enable a one-pot approach. Supercritical methanol or ethanol is employed as both the oil-extraction medium and the transesteriﬁcation reagent Vieitez et al. 2008 . In the case of catalyst-free supercritical ethanol positive effects from water were observed up to 10 wt which is encouraring as water plays an important role in the saponiﬁcation process lowering the yield. Finally the use of bio- catalysts such as lipase for the transesteriﬁcation of TAG offers an environmentally more attractive option to the conventional pro- cesses reduces the energy-input and facilitats the removal of glycerol Cantrell et al. 2008 . Recently many researchers have explored the potential of lipase biocatalysts for producing diesel fuel via transerteriﬁcation Antczak et al. 2009 Guldhe et al. 2016 . The application of lipases as biocatalyst for trans- esteriﬁcation eliminates the need for separation recovery of by- products including glycerol soaps and diacylglyceroals which are the main by-products when chemical catalysts are used for industrial biodiesel production but also algae derived lipophilic compounds including pigments Antczak et al. 2009 . Lipases are capable of catalyzing both esteriﬁcation of free fatty acids and transesteriﬁcaiton of TAG. Together these features make lipase biocatalsyts a promising alternative to conventional chemical ones Antczak et al. 2009 Khan et al. 2009 . The design of a suitable co- solvent system and low operational temperature are essential to prolonge their activity Su and Wei 2014 . 3.3. Fermentation 3.3.1. Biogas Biogas is mainly composed of CH4 and CO2 with traces of other gases such as H2S. Organic feedstocks and waste streams with high moisture content 80e90 are suitable for anaerobic digestion AD Demirbas 2010 . This is a very important advantage as drying of algae slurries is very energy intensive. The conversion to methane occurs via hydrolysis to soluble sugars followed by fermentation to alcohols volatile fatty acids acetic acid and gaseous products. These are then converted by a complex microbial ecologic system methanogenesis to H2 and CO2 which in turn are partially metabolized to CH4 65e75 and CO2 25e35 Ward et al. 2014 . The biogas yield and quality composition depend on the feedstock composition temperature pH solid and hydraulic retention time and feeding rate. An overview of biogas yields from various microalgae is available in Table 7. The C N ratio plays a crucial role for an effective and stable AD process. The optimal C N ratio for biogas production ranges between 20 1 and 30 1 whereas the lower C N ratio causes nutritional imbalance and lower biogas production Hidaka et al. 2014 . Too low C N ratio can be by-passed via co-digestion of algae biomass with a nitrogen poor organic substrate such as paper waste and sewage sludge. Yen and Brune 2007 found the CH4 production rate to be doubled from 0.6 to 1.2 mL L 1 day 1 when algae biomass was co-digested with paper waste as compared to the pure algae biomass feedstock. Likewise Costa et al. 2012 reported a 26 CH4 production rate increase by co-digesting Ulva sp. with manure and sewage sludge. The micro- algae cell wall is a complex structure and is typically composed of cellulose hemicelluloses and pectin which limits the accessibility to bacteria. Pretreatment to deconstruct the microalgae cell wall structure could speed up the digestibility and in principle also the bacterial methanogenesis activity.

The maximum yield of 307 mL biogas g 1 VS was achieved at optimal microwave conditions compared to 172 mL biogas g 1 VS without any pretreatment Passos et al. 2013 . In addition microalgae cultivation designated for the production and isolation of proteins or peptides goes in hand with AD of the residue obtained after protein extraction as the latter presents a more optimal C N ratio Bravo-Fritz et al. 2016 . AD of algae biomass residues to energy and bio-fertilizers is an important option to be considered as the energy-input is much lower compared to other conversion methods Naik et al. 2010 . Recently Criddle et al. demonstrated the conversion of methane to poly hydroxybutyrate blends as a way to increase the biogas value Myung et al. 2015 . Further research on carbon rich substrates for co-digestion and on effective pretreatments is indispensable to make the AD process more valuable and cost-effective. 3.3.2. Bioethanol While in the last 10 years the focus was set on the lipid fraction for biofuel production more recently research is being conducted for the conversion of microalgae carbohydrates e.g. to ethanol Fig. 3 Laurens et al. 2015 . Bioethanol production from algae biomass typically occurs over 3 stages 1 recovery of fermentable starch stored in the algae cells which requieres the deconstruction of the cell walls 2 starch hydrolysis using a-amylases and 3 fermentation of released sugars to ethanol using yeast strains. In the ﬁnal stage ethanol separation and puriﬁcation is done usually by distillation-rectiﬁcation-dehydration of the diluted alcohol product 10e15 ethanol McKendry 2002 part 2 . The puriﬁed ethanol ca. 95 is then extracted and condensed. As the feedstock cost represents ca. 55e80 of the ﬁnal alcohol market price it is important to valorize the biomass residue e.g. by gasiﬁcation to syngas Lam and Lee 2011 Petrou and Pappis 2009 . Microalgae contain a wide range of polysaccharides Chen et al. 2013 Markou et al. 2012 . Still it remains not completely under- stood which of them can be fermented to ethanol. Micro-organisms capable of fermenting laminarin and mannitol have been identiﬁed and partially characterized by Horn et al. 2000a b . Alginate brown algae is less suitable for ethanol fermentation because the redox balance favors formation of pyruvate and biogas as the end product Bird and Benson 1987 . This was the case for Laminaria hyperborea and Ascophyllum nodosum which are commercial spe- cies cultivated in Norway. Although the digestion of these algae occurred in very smooth conditions as the cell walls of these species do not contain lignin and cellulose polyphenols did hamper the yields signiﬁcantly. Algal biomass extracted in supercritical me- dium can be used as a substrate for ethanol production as demonstrated by Harun et al. 2010 . Bioethanol titers and yields have been reported between 3.6 and 11.7 g L 1 and 197e260 mg ethanol g 1 dry cell. In 2013 Aikawa et al. 2013 achieved 6.5 g L 1 and 350 mg g 1 using glycogen containing cyanobacteria. This corresponded with 1.1 L bioethanol L 1 medium day 1 and a theoretical bioethanol yield of 86 . Several algae such as red and green algae contain both starch and cellulose which can be exploited together for ethanol production after succesful hydrolysis John et al. 2011 . Kim 2009 fermented red algae Gelidium amansii for bioethanol production on commercial scale with sul- phuric acid and obtained 89 theoretical bioethanol yield after 72 h.

Fig. 3. Production of carbohydrate derived bioethanol via fermentation. A. Raheem et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 181 2018 42e59 49 3.3.3. Photobiological hydrogen production Hydrogen H2 is a substantial energy carrier and has minimal environmental impacts Hosseini and Wahid 2016 . In recent years photobiological H2 production from algae biomass has become a novel research ﬁeld. Note that dark H2 production is classiﬁed as a fermentation. H2 is a respiration metabolite formed by hydroge- nases Fan et al. 2016 Hosseini and Wahid 2016 . Several micro- algae species can modulate their genetic enzymatic and metabolic expression to produce H2 Ghirardi et al. 2000 . In photosynthet- ically grown microalgae water molecules are converted to oxygen O2 protons Hþ and electrons e by means of solar energy Fig. 4a and recombines the derived Hþ and e into chemical en- ergy by assimilating them in metabolic systems such as hydroge- nase Fig. 4b or nitrogenase enzymes to produce H2 Fitch and Kemker 2014 Trchounian 2015 . H2 production from water via solar energy proposes the maximum theroretical photon conver- sion effeciency. However attaining high efﬁciency in converting the electrons in water to electrons in H2 is practically challenging due to the high O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase system. Co-production of O2 is considered as a limiting factor as it inhibits the hydrogenase pathway Fan et al. 2016 Su and Wei 2014 Zhang et al. 2012 . A customized cell lines and production system may allow a simulta- neous but separated production of H2 and O2 to overcome the aformentioned drawbacks Melis et al. 2000 . Otherwise micro- algae cultures need to be grown in anaerobic conditions for H2 production Antal et al. 2015 . Scoma et al. 2012 and Volgusheva et al. 2013 have reported the highest bio-H2 production efﬁ- ciencies for microalgae. As shown in Fig. 4a microalgae capture solar energy via light-harvesting complex LHC proteins during the photosynthesis process. Those proteins are categorised as LHCI or LHCII based on their prevalent interaction with either photosystem I PSI or II PSII respectively. The excitation energy transmitted to PSII by LHCII Fig. 4a runs the photosynthetic water splitting re- action which transforms H2O into Hþ e and O2. One way to accelerate the H2 production is to cultivate the microalgae in me- diums deprived from oxygen and or sulfur phosphor or nitrogen Philipps et al. 2012 . This approach gradually decreases the photosynthetic capacity due to inactivation of the photosystem PSII as the respiration is upheld Fig. 4b . It causes the depletion of O2 the expression of hydrogenase genes and ﬁnally the release of H2. Another approach employs carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhy- drazone CCCP to drive the equilibrium to H2 production Yang et al. 2014a . But by suppressing the PSII activity of algae the light conversion efﬁciency decreases and subsequently the supply of electrons is cut which in turn limits the hydrogenase catalyzed H2 production. Research on hydrogenases Ghirardi 2015 Zhang et al. 2012 and oxygen tolerance Fan et al. 2016 Flynn et al. 2002 of hydrogen-producing algae species has been published. Recently signiﬁcant progress was demostrated in this ﬁeld Das et al. 2015 . The authors reported a 20 times higher H2 produc- tion from immobilized C. reinhardtii microalgae in continous ﬂow regime as compared to previously reported batch production. This way the microalgae do not need to be replaced for prolonged times with possible applications as artiﬁcal leaf systems in sheet-like devices. 4. Emerging microalgae biofuels and integrated technologies 4.1. Renewable diesel and naphtha Considering the relative high amount of ashes in microalgae and the composition of their lipids FA unsaturation degree and carbon number and presence of other lipids such as sterols as compared to plant vegetable oils the manufacturing of biodiesel results more challenging with respect to the quality standards and the cold ﬂow properties Stansell et al. 2012 . The hydrocarbon analog of bio- diesel is renewable or green diesel Fig. 5 which is a non- oxygenated parafﬁnic fuel produced by hydrotreating of bio- derived fats or oils through reduction of unsaturated bonds and hydrodeoxygenation of carboxyl groups. Algal lipids can also be used to produce blendstocks for jet fuel. Renewable diesel and jet fuel blendstocks do not have oxidative stability related problems as severe as those of biodiesel. Algae lipids can provide straight-chain hydrocarbons which improve the cetane number. Unless they are heavily isomerized branched they also might suffer from cold weather performance problems comparable to those experienced with biodiesel and are more likely to be destined for blending with petroleum fuels. The saturation degree of the algal lipids is an important factor for the economics of the hydro treatment and in the transportation stability of intermediates. Triacylglycerol TAG and FA waste feedstocks suit well for conversion to renewable diesel and jet fuel but for naphtha these straight chain alkanes are poor starting materials as they provide relatively low-octane numbers. Addi- tional isomerization steps or blending with high-octane feedstocks are needed in this case. Most of the hydrotreating processes rely on the use of supported metal catalysts under hydrothermal condi- tions. Likewise glycerol co-product from TAG can be converted to propane useful as a feedstock for liqueﬁed petroleum gas. The hydrotreating should minimize additional CO2 CO losses and reduce the supply of H2. Vardon et al. 2014 used the glycerol by- product to generate H2 in situ to reduce external H2 supply. Moreover renewable diesel actually tends to decrease engine-out NOx emissions in modern diesel engines at least from diesel pro- duced from hydrotreated vegetal oil Lehto et al. 2011 . Crude algal oil may contain high levels of phosphorous from phospholipids nitrogen from extracted proteins and metals especially Fig. 4. Photosynthetic production of bio-hydrogen from water in a aerobic and b anaerobic media. Adapted from Oey et al. 2016 . Fig. 5. a Biodiesel b renewable diesel and c renewable naphtha production from triacylglycerides TAG . A. Raheem et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 181 2018 42e59 50 magnesium from chlorophyll . Further research in crude algae oil puriﬁcation together with the development of tolerant hydro- treatment catalysts is therefore imminent. When using algae HTL oil as a feedstock the advantage is that energy intensive drying steps are by-passed as the lipids are not required to be extracted ﬁrst Rogers et al. 2014 . The residual aqueous phase can be gasiﬁed and recycled to the algae nutrient feed. 4.2. Integer biomass valorization Further efforts to maximize the complete biomass utilization are highly desired. For instance industrial scale production of biodiesel from microalgae would generate important amounts of lipid- extracted biomass LEB . LEB can be used as a feedstock for gasiﬁ- cation pyrolysis and biological fermentation as well as a food source for livestock and aquatic life. Ou et al. 2015 described the production of biofuels from defatted algae via thermo-chemical conversion methods showing competitive production costs as the cost of defatted microalgae feedstocks is much lower as compared to whole microalgae feedstocks. Another process strat- egy as demonstrated by Laurens et al. 2015 consists of an acid- catalyzed pretreatment for integrated lipid- and carbohydrate- based biofuel production Fig. 6 . More than 90 of the available glucose was recovered in the hydrolysate liquor from the pre- treatment of Scenedesmuss biomass. Besides obtaining ethanol from this fraction the access to the lipid fraction in subsequent conver- sion of the solid residue becomes signiﬁcantly improved resulting in 97 recovery of the FA present in the biomass. This way 97 gasoline gallon equivalents gge of combined biofuel was pro- duced from a 143 gge theoretical fuel potential. TEA analysis for the combined biofuel production showed that the cost can be reduced with 33 as compared to lipid-based biofuel production only. One of the key challenges in the production of biofuels is the development of suitable valorization methods of the co-products left over after recovery of the lipid and or carbohydrate derived products. This remaining fraction is typically enriched in proteins. Commercial products from algae proteins not mentioning R D still remains poorly described. The main reason for this is the high cost associated for their extraction and puriﬁcation. Vanthoor- Koopmans et al. 2013 proposed an algae bioreﬁnery scheme in which ﬁrst hydrophilic components proteins and carbohydrates are extracted followed by extraction and fractionation of lipids and ﬁnal recovery of insoluble components. Ruiz et al. adopted this scheme to preserve their functionality Ruiz et al. 2016 and esti- mated the costs for cell disruption followed by aqueous two phase extraction with polyethylene glycol and potassium phosphate Cunha and Aires-Barros 2002 followed by membrane ﬁltrations in a cascade process Gerardo et al. 2014 . However these pro- cesses also lead to a high cost 70e80 of the total reﬁnery cost . Another important market of algae derived proteins is animal food Subhadra 2011 . In contrast to plant derived biofuels or bio- products microalgae do not compete for fertile land in the food production chain. Along with vegetable protein sources e.g. soy bean and canola meal they must replace traditional protein sour- ces used in meat production chains Doran 2000 Sekar and Chandramohan 2008 Skjånes et al. 2013 . Considering the un- sustainable expense of water and energy in animal protein pro- duction it is important to mention the current global need to move to plant derived protein production systems. Bacterial production systems are more productive but cannot compete in price Kusnadi et al. 1997 . The current production cost of algae proteins is esti- mated ca. 3 USD kg 1 Costa et al. 2012 Ruiz et al. 2016 which is competitive with plant derived proteins Doran 2000 . Aquacul- ture is the fastest growing food production industry reaching 132 million tons of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh and 43 million tons of seaweed by 2020 Gjedrem et al. 2012 . Algae play an important role in aqua- culture to recover phosphates and as a direct nitrogen source as part of ﬁsh diets or after treatment with yeasts Farrelly et al. 2013 . Algal meal can provide an ideal replacement for ﬁsh meal in animal feeds because algae offer twice the protein of soy on weight-basis and offer a higher micronutrient content and lower level of inor- ganic pollutants such as mercury Doran 2000 . Currently ﬁsh meal and algal meal are produced in similar volumes 5.8 million tons and have similar commercial value 1.2e1.8 USD kg 1 Subhadra 2011 Subhadra and Edwards 2011 . Some secondary metabolites have high added-value in a wide range of industrial medical and nutritional applications. However positive health effects of some algae metabolites are still not completely understood and their market niches and volumes are limited. Still as they have a high commercial value a better valo- rization of residue streams in the production of algae derived bio- fuels is the key to reach proﬁtability in large scale plants Bravo- Fritz et al. 2016 Rizwan et al. 2015 Skjånes et al. 2013 . The problem here is that the production of large amounts of secondary metabolites generally is induced by growth-stress conditions after optimal growth conditions which goes not in hand with micro- algae cultivation for biofuels. Recently Skjånes et al. 2013 reviewed which secondary metabolites can be produced compat- ibly with the production of H2 which is a biofuel that is produced under anaerobic stress conditions especially under sulfur depre- viation and typically in green algae such as Chlamydomonas rein- hardtii. Deprivation from sulfur leads to a degradation of PSII components inhibiting the oxidation of water creating anaerobic conditions while respiration proceeds. When the Calvin cycle is no longer active in CO2 reduction the reductive pressure is released by transferring electrons from ferredoxin to hydrogenase that con- verts this reductive energy to form hydrogen which can easily be released from the cell. 4.3. Integrated technologies CO2 biosequestration and wastewater treatment The rapid rise in population coupled with an increasing urban- ization and industrialization has increased the production of both wastewater and carbon dioxide emissions. To more forward to more sustainable production systems it is important to develop these systems adapted to existing and established industrial sites Fig. 6. Acid pretreatment of algae slurries for the integrated production of bioethanol and renewable diesel. A. Raheem et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 181 2018 42e59 51 such as wastewater treatment plants cement industries and power plants which would largely simplify the supply chain of the algae cultivation resources. As shown in Fig. 7 integrated microalgae cultivation approaches can be implemented in CO2 point-sources CO2 biosequestration and in wastewater treatment sites to recover phosphorus and nitrogen or for bioremediation of con- taminants resulting from industrial agricultural or municipal sources. Today still a large proportion of electric energy generation oc- curs in coal-ﬁred power plants and is unequivocally related to increasing climate change concerns Kucukvar and Tatari 2011 . Various research and development strategies for cost-effective CO2 capture from ﬂue gases are being conducted throughout the globe Bhujade et al. 2017 . Biological CO2 sequestration via algae is a novel concept in CO2 mitigation strategies. Co-locating microalgae production facilities can utilize CO2 from ﬂue gases emitted from various stationary combustion sources such as fossil fuel-ﬁred po- wer stations cement plants ethanol plants etc. Supplemental CO2 feeding to algae cultivars has long been known to increase algal growth rate Langley et al. 2012 . Several studies have testiﬁed that algae cultivations aerated with ﬂue gas supplemented with some intermediate CO2 amounts 4e7 v v tend to increase biomass productivity Anjos et al. 2013 Bhola et al. 2011 Mattos et al. 2012 . A good control of the CO2 ﬂux within the system enables a good pH management which can reduce the risk of microbial contamination and may improve the metabolic ﬂux Selvaratnam et al. 2014 Wang and Curtis 2016 . However transportation of ﬂue gases is costly. Pure CO2 transportation via pipelines is the most cost-effective method for carrying large amounts of CO2 over longer distances Leung et al. 2014 . The level of impurities such as moisture nitrogen oxides NOx sulfur oxides SOx mercury Hg oxygen O2 particulate matter and hydrogen chloride HCl make transportation also more costly by enhancing the total volume required to be pumped to the algae cultivars and due to high corrosion rates Venteris et al. 2014 . The effect of aforementioned impurities on algal biomass growth is not fully understood some investigations have found that SOx and NOx perform as nutrients supplements whilst others have reported them to be toxic at higher concentrations Kao et al. 2014 Zhao and Su 2014 . Considering the low CO2 mass transfer rate in algae suspensions the CO2 feeding should be carefully optimized. Moreover bio- reactors design should be capable of prolonging the CO2 retention time and so the mass transfer efﬁciency especially in open ponds in order to evade the loss of CO2 into atmosphere. Li et al. 2013 proposed a closed raceway pond through a normal open raceway pond with a unique transparent cover touching the algae culture s surface to increase the CO2 utilization rate. The results showed 95 CO2 ﬁxation efﬁciency under intermittent CO2 supply. Important for further improvements is to acquire a better understanding of biological CO2 concentration not only to curb the soaring CO2 emissions from coal-ﬁred power plants but also to propose a wider base of biofuels supplies at large scale. Enriched sources of waste carbon such as from ethanol and ammonia plants have compa- rable cost to purchasing medical-grade CO2. Natural gas-ﬁred po- wer plants can also be considered as a source of CO2 for algae production although the concentration in the output emissions 4e6 is so dilute that the algae facility needs to be practically co- located to avoid excessive gas transport costs. During night time CO2 emissions seem to be unavoidable but methods have been developed to store CO2 so that it can be used by algae during daylight hours. Global Algae Innovations USA suggested that the overall emission utilization could be increased using a CO2 absorber Fishman et al. 2010 . The ﬂue gas from an adjacent power plant is captured for 24 h a day on a 3.3 ha cultivation farm. Excess CO2 is stored and used when the power plant is not operational or when warm and sunny days present. Their system based on 90 utili- zation efﬁciency can capture 80 from ﬂue gas sources with low CO2 concentrations 4e5 and up to 90 from higher- concentration sources coal . More recently Global Algae In- novations has been able to operate their farm without the need for gas distribution and control. Duarte et al. 2017 demonstrated a biological CO2 capture using closed Erlenmeyer ﬂask-type photo- bioreactors at Presidente Medici coal based electric Plant in Brazil via two algae species i.e. chlorella fusca and spirulina sp. . Chlorella fusca was found more efﬁcient by ﬁxing 2.6 times more CO2 compared to Spirulina sp. The optimum CO2 ﬁxation with Chlorella fusca 360 1 mg L 1 day 1 corresponded with a speciﬁc growth rate of 0.17 day 1 from coal fuel gas was achieved. Olia and Quchan 2016 recently conducted a feasibility study of microalgae-based CO2 removal technology in an open pond system at Tous Fer- dowsi Gas Power Plant located in north east of Iran. The technol- ogy was claimed to be more economical compared to conventional carbon capture and storage methods such as pre-combustion during-combustion and post-combustion. National Aluminum Company NALCO successfully demonstrated carbon capture and storage using an open pond algae cultivation system in Captive Thermal Power Plant at Orissa India Styring et al. 2011 . The re- sults showed 70e90 CO2 up take efﬁciency and an algal biomass recovery of 22 tons acre 1 year 1 was achieved. The use of algae to capture CO2 from power plant emissions deﬁnitely deserves further research. 4.4. Microalgae biomass conversion to bioelectricity The microalgae-microbial fuel cell mMFC offers an attractive option to produce bioelectricity and treat the wastewater via a biological pathway allowing algae to handle a range of substrates at various concentrations Lee et al. 2015 . Many studies reported the successful application of microalgal biomass as biocathode in mMFC either in suspended or attached form Del Campo et al. 2013 Liu et al. 2013 Mohan et al. 2014 . Recently research has been conducted on the possibility of zero-carbon electricity pro- duction by using microalgae grown in a cathode chamber as a substrate to the bioﬁlm in the anodic chamber Cui et al. 2014 Kondaveeti et al. 2014 Rashid et al. 2013 . The applicability of mMFC as bioremediation unit of pollutants was recently reported Jiang et al. 2012 Powell et al. 2011a 2011b . Research and ad- vances on design of new materials catalysts and substrates has lowered the overall cost increased the applicability and efﬁciency of mMFCs Baicha et al. 2016 . The application of Chlorella vulgaris Fig. 7. Schematic illustration of microalgae cultivation integrated with thermal power plants for CO2 biosequestration and with wastewater recycling for nutrient recovery and bioremediation. A. Raheem et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 181 2018 42e59 52 as biocathode was tested by Powell et al. 2009 . It was reported that algae acted as an electron acceptor and was able to grow using CO2 generated at the cathode. Proper operating conditions could help to sustain the continuous electron ﬂow and could generate continuous electrical energy. The major advantage of using microalgae in mMFC is that it can be used as an electron donor and simultaneously as donor and acceptor when they are in both anodic and cathodic chambers . Moreover mMFC generates current both in dark and light conditions Xu et al. 2015 . However the introduction of microalgae in mMFCs is quite recent. Their conﬁg- urations can be grouped into single chamber double chambers or photosynthetic sediment Fig. 8 . Sensitivity to seasonal variation optimal design lack of data regarding symbiotic relationships with bacterial species and light source constraints are signiﬁcant chal- lenges still to be addressed Cui et al. 2014 Saba et al. 2017 . 4.5. Metabolic engineering Microalgae are still not a fully explored from a biotechnological point of view. It is believed that out of 10 000 species exiting only a few 1000 are explored a few 100 are examined for the production of bio-active compounds and other value-added products and very few are cultivated in industrial large scale quantities. The need for screening microalgae strains in natural environments is an obvious research area for instance strains that withstand high CO2 con- centrations suitable for application in industrial ﬂue gases which resist higher temperatures or that digest contaminants in waters and soils etc. On the other hand instead of seeking for strains in natural environments one can try to design algae cells making them to shift their metabolism to the area of interest by introducing recombinant DNA to trigger the target algae metabolites produc- tion. Genetic manipulation of cyanobacteria is generally more advanced than that of eukaryotic algae because many of the tools developed for bacterial genetics are applicable in cyanobacteria Fishman et al. 2010 . For example spontaneous transformation double-homologous recombination and protein tagging are routine in some cyanobacterial systems Vermaas 1998 . Next to fermentation certain products e.g. ethanol can also be produced directly as an algae metabolite which can be secreted in the growth medium. Bioethanol production via hydrolysis and fermentation usually involves extensive downstream processing and is an important obstacle for the commercial scale production of algae based biofuel Hammed et al. 2016 . Through cultivation of strains that are able to produce volatile alcohols or aldehydes as metabolites that can be secreted out of the cell way less time and energy is spent. Bioethanol can be produced from photosyntheti- cally formed starch or by feeding sugar carbon sources to the algae dark anaerobic fermentation . Examples of such strains are Chlorella vulgaris and Chlamydomonas perigranulata Daroch et al. 2013 Hon-Nami 2006 . The heterotrophic method was demon- strated in closed PBR utilizing seawater with metabolically engi- neered cyanobacteria being resistant to high temperature salinity and ethanol levels Hirayama et al. 1998 . The volatile products in the headspace can be condensed to liquid biofuels. Because of its good volatility and well-established puriﬁcation technologies ethanol would be the preferred product. Other products like cel- lulose and sucrose Nobles and Brown 2008 isobutanol Atsumi et al. 2009 ethylene Eckert et al. 2014 and free fatty acids Rufﬁng 2014 were also produced by direct secretion using transgenic methods. Alkanes and alkenes including isoprene as the basic unit of synthetic rubber also have been produced in engi- neered strains of Synechocystis Wang et al. 2013b Lindberg et al. 2010 . The ethanol titres obtained are rather low 1 wt for Chla- mydomonas reinhardtii Hirano et al. 1997 . The direct conversion to ethanol involves pyruvate decarboxylase pcd and alcohol de- hydrogenase adh Kimmerer 1987 Yang et al. 2014b . Deng and Coleman 1999 reported the cultivation of an autotrophic cyano- bacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 introducing bacterial pcd and adh genes from Zymomonas mobilis to induce the direct syn- thesis of bioethanol up to 5.5 g L 1 titers. The use of ampicillin as a selectable marker during the cultivations implied serious envi- ronmental concerns although this issue was addressed later in 2009 Dexter and Fu 2009 . Nevertheless this approach might result inefﬁcient over longer time as the manipulations were found to destabilize culture growth by metabolic reprogramming of the cells rather than growth inhibition by ethanol. But after all the role of pdc and adh genes for a direct route to bioethanol producing algae with the help of metabolic engineering cannot be ignored as an attempt to bypass multiple time-consuming processes. Algenol Biotech LLC USA claims to manufacture up to ca. 25 m3 ethanol year 1 on 0.4 ha of algae cultivar using the direct-secretion process and CO2 from a power plant to accelerate the algae growth Fishman et al. 2010 . Metabolic engineering techniques also have been applied to increase the production of biodiesel. Lipid accumulation is crucial here. In 1990 Roessler and Ohlrogge 1990 isolated and Fig. 8. Schematic illustration of algae-based-MFC systems a algae as a carbon source for micro-organisms in the anodic chamber and b algae in the cathodic camber to capture the CO2 produced. A. Raheem et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 181 2018 42e59 53 characterized for the ﬁrst time a full-length gene which encodes for acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase ACCase in Cyclotella cryptica. In 2015 De Bhowmick et al. 2015 reviewed the improvements in this ﬁeld including overexpression of rate limiting enzymes partici- pating in the lipid biosynthesis increasing the accessibility of precursor genes such as ACCase blocking and or down regulating the rival pathways and lipid catabolism by RNAi-mediated silencing and lowering the fatty acid insaturation proﬁle followed by opti- mizing the chain length with thioesterases. In fact the knockdown of a Chlamydomonas citrate synthase which incorporates acetyl- CoA into the citric acid cycle competing with FA synthesis led to a major increase 169 in TAG content providing strong evi- dence for the hypothesis of substrate competition carbon parti- tioning for TAG and starch synthesis in green algae. A very recent study has cleared out the biological functioning of starch Krishnan et al. 2015 which can explain some negative physiological effects with sta6 mutant algae Breuer et al. 2014 . One such an effect is a distorted cell wall cells which resulted in higher TAG contents . Metabolic engineering is also used as a tool to overcome kinetic constraints within the photosynthetic electron transfer apparatus and the Calvin-Benson cycle that impact the efﬁciency of light utilization. Notably research was conducted for engineering the photosynthetic antenna pigments to improve the light harvesting yield in general and in bulky algae cultures in particular Huesemann et al. 2009 Beckmann et al. 2009 Barry et al. 2015 De Mooij et al. 2015 . More recently the discovery of a red-shifted chlorophyll in cyanobacteria opens opportunities to extend the light quantum yield Chen and Blankenship 2011 Gan et al. 2014 . Other constraints include the coupling of proton to electron transfer associated with plastoquinone PQ reduction and oxida- tion the slow turnover numbers of Rubisco and limiting concen- trations of enzymes Kumar et al. 2016 . For example increasing the PQ pool size could buffer transients in fast PSII and slow cyto- chrome electron transfer rates. Increasing the activity or levels of the cytochrome bef complexes may also accelerate electron transfer rates. In addition the importance of optimizing Rubisco efﬁciency by concentrating CO2 at the active site requires greater cyclic photophosphorylation activity to produce sufﬁcient ATP for active bicarbonate uptake. Finally it cannot be neglected that the current status of algae biotechnology is still not fully developed and adopted. It is important to dispose of selective screening tools for mutants. Typically this is accomplished by introducing an antibiotic resis- tance gene as a selectable marker along with the transgene in the organellar or nuclear genome Dunahay et al. 1995 . Since in most cases antibiotic resistance is not directly linked to transgene expression it may not be necessary to maintain antibiotics at large- scale if the transgene is stably integrated into the genome or if counter-selection methods have been used to remove the antibiotic resistance cassette Cheah et al. 2013 . However recent studies have demonstrated that the long-term stability of transgene expression in the absences of direct selection can be impacted by the copy number of the transgene Kumar et al. 2013 . Recently other interesting detection alternatives have been demonstrated by Manandhar-Shrestha and Hildebrand 2013 and Terashima et al. 2015 e.g. inositol polyphosphates and TOR kinase for the rapid detection of desired properties such as lipid accumulation Xie et al. 2014 . Gene identiﬁcation either by partial or complete nu- clear genome sequencing and transcriptomic proﬁling of potential production strains has elucidated the gene expression under nutrient deprivation Carpinelli et al. 2014 Jia et al. 2015 Mansfeldt et al. 2016 . For a review on current technologies employed to probe and edit the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii nuclear genome see Jinkerson and Jonikas 2015 . New sequencing tech- nologies enable a comprehensive coverage of mRNA transcripts. Small RNA also has been identiﬁed in microalgae and should be considered in investigations of gene expression regulation espe- cially with regard to translational regulation Lopez-Gomollon et al. 2014 . 5. Conclusions Microalgae guard a still under-exploited potential for the bio- based reﬁnery due to multiple challenges in different ﬁelds. The most diﬁcult one is related to their inherent algae cell biology direct sunlight energy greatly exceeds the photosynthetic capacity of the cells at light saturation levels. The challenges in the ﬁeld of microalgae cultivation are mainly related to their scalability oper- ational stability and associated costs. The challenges in harvesting and extraction of microalgae is mainly related to the energy input especially concentrating and drying of the diluted algae cultures. Conversion methods that directly act on diluted wet algae biomass are highly desired such as hydrothermal liquefaction. Other thermo-chemical conversion methods include gasiﬁcation and pyrolysis. Transesteriﬁcation of algae derived lipid oil results in the production of biodiesel whereas biochemical conversion methods proceed via fermentations to biogas bioethanol and other prod- ucts. Recent developments show that algae lipid oils are prefen- tially converted to green diesel and naphtha via hydrotreating as their composition and structural characteristics are not optimal for commerical biodiesel production. Current developments in microalgae research also tend to improve their valorization by considering their three main fractions lipids carbohydrates and proteins. Acid hydrolysis of algae slurries at moderated tempera- tures recently showed promising results in this sense. Further research in cost-effective reﬁning of these fractions are highly desired not only to maximize the biomass utilization but also because the better valorization of residue streams or co-products are the only way to make better projections for the proﬁtability of commercial algae production plants. Research in protein char- acterization extraction and valorization is clearly under- investigated and needs to be further developed as they do show to be cost-competitive with proteins from plant and bacterial pro- duction systems. The cultivation of algae in the vecinity of point sources like power plants as a biosequestration strategy for CO2 mitigation and the application of algae in nutrient recycling and environmental remediation are also becoming prominent research ﬁelds. Finally metabolic engineering of algae cells is a promising tool to tune algal biochemical factories in the direction of interest. However progress in this ﬁeld has to further break through as the biotechnological tools for algae are not that widely established and adopted yet as compared to bacteria and yeasts.

Therefore the widespread interest in producing biofuels from microalgae has gained considerable interest among leading energy experts and researchers due to the burgeoning global issues stemming from the depletion of fossil fuel reserves future energy security increasing greenhouse gas emissions and the competition for limited resources between food crops and conven- tional biomass feedstock. This paper aims to present the recent advances in biofuel production from microalgae and the potential beneﬁts of microalgae in the energy and environmental sectors as well as sustainable development. Besides bottlenecks and challenges mainly relating to techniques of cultivation and harvesting as well as downstream processes are completely presented. Promising solutions and novel A. T.

Alternatively the role of microalgae in the circular economy is thor- oughly analyzed indicating that the potential of scaling up current microalgae-based production could beneﬁt from the waste-to-energy strategy with microalgae as a key intermediate. In the future further research into combining different microalgae biomass pretreatment techniques separating the microalgae feedstock from the cultured media developing new species and optimizing the biofuel production process should be carried out to reduce the prices of microal- gae biofuels. Keywords Microalgae Biofuel Bottlenecks Beneﬁts Circular economy Introduction Along with the extraordinary pace of technological advances the twenty-ﬁrst century also faces incredi- bly difﬁcult global challenges such as overpopulation climate change food scarcity depletion of fossil fuels etc. Hoang et al. 2021c Bhushan et al. 2020 Nayak and Mishra 2016 . Indeed the growing reliance on nonrenewable sources of energy has prompted a growing interest in ﬁnding more sustainable solutions to meet the increasing global energy demands this lesson could be observed more clearly from the shifting progress to clean energy and energy crisis after the COVID19 pandemic Steffen et al. 2020 Chen et al. 2021 . Among the renewable and clean energy sources solar power presents a vast amount of renewable energy harnessed from the sun through photosynthesis plants use sunlight to grow and mature Udayan et al. 2022 Hariskos and Posten 2014 . Therefore plant biomass-derived carbonaceous mate- rials present a promising and widely available source of feedstock for biofuel production such as microal- gae crop residues and organic wastes Hoang et al. 2022 Papathoti et al. 2021 Alami et al. 2021 . The conversion of widely available biomass into promising sources of renewable energy such as biofuels has been a popular topic among current scientists and energy researchers Chen et al. 2022 Aissi et al. 2021 Hoang and Pham 2021 . Biofuels are commonly classiﬁed into three different categories including ﬁrst second and third generation. Biofuels produced from food crops are considered ﬁrst-generation such as bio- ethanol made from starch. For biofuels that are derived from non-food crops such as lignocellulosic biomass can be grouped into the second-generation category. Last but not least biofuels derived from microalgae and microbes are considered the third generation category Sirohi et al. 2022a SB et al. 2022 . One of the major challenges facing the production of biofuels is the inadequate and inconsistent supply of biomass feedstock Koyande et al. 2019 . Further- more the conversion of ﬁrst-generation biofuels from food crops also raises the controversial food versus fuel debate as they compete for the same amount of arable land and freshwater resources. Recently dif- ferent species of microalgae have received much attention for their potential of being a promising feedstock for the production of third-generation bio- fuels Mishra et al. 2017 . Due to the incredibly fast growth rate and high carbon efﬁciency microalgae present major beneﬁts as a substrate for biofuel production. Examining the structure of microalgae one can ﬁnd the presence of several bioactive com- pounds such as lipids proteins carbohydrates and fractions of anti-oxidants Kusmayadi et al. 2021 Yu et al. 2021a . Besides the potential as a biofuel feedstock microalgae are packed with a signiﬁcant amount of nutrients that can be utilized in food R.

Microalgae also have a special role in dye products cosmetics and the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore studies also have found the beneﬁt of microalgae as an effective pollution control agent Aliyu et al. 2021 . Among major industries such as biochemical engineering food production and pharmaceutical there has been an increasing trend in the use of microalgae as a solution to address the burgeoning issues of sustain- able production and consumption of food feed and fuel as shown in Fig. 1. Compared to other biofuel alternatives microalgae-derived biofuels demonstrate a higher potential and practicality Kazemi Shariat Panahi et al. 2019b . Depending on the species of microalgae the efﬁciency of bioethanol can be signiﬁcantly increased when there is a higher content of carbohydrates e.g. up to 30 of dry weight Kazemi Shariat Panahi et al. 2019a . Using sunlight via photosynthesis microalgae are capable of converting nutrients in the water to bioactive compounds that make up the primary cell structure Verma et al. 2020 . As microalgae they feed off the nutrients e.g. nitrogen phosphates and trace elements when converting CO2 into organic compounds with the energy provided from sunlight. Considering this characteristic alone microalgae present a likely solution for wastewater treatment and CO2 bioremediation in industrial processes Cunha et al. 2020 suggesting that microalgae could be a key and critical link in the progress of converting waste to energy. Another signiﬁcant advantage in the farming of microalgae is that it does not compete for the same resources required for the cultivation of traditional food crops. Furthermore provided with high concentrations of CO2 microalgae can grow at a rapid pace while utilizing and offsetting the CO2 source such as ﬂue gas from thermal power plants Singh et al. 2019a Sirohi et al. 2021 . Furthermore the technologies utilized in the production of biofuels from microalgae also have a lower carbon footprint Fig. 1 Potential application of microalgae in various ﬁelds 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1091 and lower negative impacts on the ecosystem because the equipment used in microalgae-based biofuel technologies has a low-energy consumption level Bwapwa et al. 2017 Khoo et al. 2020 . Due to this reason promoting the use of microalgae-derived biofuels can yield a positive sustainability effect on the environment since it is considered carbon neutral thus there is a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in pursuing this promising source on the path toward a higher sustain- able energy future based on the circular economy and carbon neutrality Javed et al. 2019 . Despite extensive progress in the development of microalgae technology signiﬁcant challenges remain surrounding the techno-economic viability of microal- gae-derived biofuels. Among the current obstacles cultivation techniques need further research to improve the biomass concentration of microalgae grown in suspended culture as well as ﬁnd an adequate supply of CO2 and affordable growth medium for industrial-scale farming Suparmaniam et al. 2019 MT et al. 2022 . Notably high concen- trations of nutrients and different variety of salts are needed in the culture medium to support the growth of microalgae Baicha et al. 2016 . Moreover increasing cost is a signiﬁcant issue in the operation of microal- gae cultivation systems in suspended cultures Tan et al. 2015 . Upon harvesting the next step is to decide which conversion method that depends signiﬁcantly on the conditions of the farmed biomass and the desired biofuel products Kumar et al. 2020 . Overall there are reasons and gaps to have further studies of the development of biofuels production from microalgae due to several advantages and value-added products. Indeed this review paper explores existing practices while reviewing the bio-processing of microalgae also known as bio-reﬁnery of microalgae. This current work also attempts to provide an overview of the current development of third-generation biofuels derived from microalgae. Furthermore this review paper also addresses the current issues facing the implementation of microalgae bio-reﬁnery and future opportunities for the industry. On the one hand the paper summarizes the recent development in terms of strategies employed in the production of biofuels from microalgae. On the other hand it also focuses prospects opportunities and challenges on the path toward scaling up microalgae-based biofuel produc- tion and improving widespread market penetration. More importantly this review paper aims to provide insights and inputs in the strategic decisions by various stakeholders such as researchers legislators ofﬁcials environmental organizations private sectors in advancing the progress of the biofuel industry overall and improve the viability and cost-effectiveness of the microalgae-based biofuel products speciﬁcally. Microalgae properties and CO2 ﬁxation capacity Compared to various land-dwelling species of ﬂora microalgae have a signiﬁcantly higher concentration of light-harvesting pigment known as chlorophyll which results in more effective photosynthesis Kumar et al. 2021b . Several factors can inﬂuence the cellular structure and make-ups of different species of microalgae. Among these inherent conditions such as species growth media environmental factors and the coexistence of multiple strains within the same culture are examples of factors that can affect the nature and characteristics of microalgae Kim et al. 2014 . Provided with metabolic versatility microalgae are capable of being converted into a wide range of value- added products via various processing pathways. For certain species of microalgae with high concentrations of carbohydrates e.g. 37 55 such as Chlorella Chlamydomonas Dunaliella Scenedesmus and Tet- raselmis the starch-rich components are mainly found in the chloroplasts and cell walls made of cellulose Dragone et al. 2011 . Besides the lipid contents in microalgae can range between 2 and 77 of the biomass volume for certain species under favorable growth conditions. Lipids in microalgae are grouped based on the end-product from the conversion process namely biofuel and nutrient supplements Mimouni et al. 2018 Ho et al. 2020 . For the latter category microalgae present a potentially good source for the manufacturing of omega-3 fatty acids in which common microalgae species used in the production of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids include Bacil- lariophyta Chlorophyta Cryptophyta Haptophyta Haptophyta and Rhodophyta Ryckebosch et al. 2012 2014 . Last but not least proteins which are considered an essential product in the bioreﬁnery process of microalgae make up a signiﬁcant compo- nent. Depending on the species they can range anywhere between 50 70 of the biomass volume in microalgae. Proteins extracted from microalgae 123 1092 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 have different uses such as in food supplements and animal feeds e.g. aquaculture and husbandry Bertsch et al. 2021 . Furthermore pigments and other bioactive compounds can also be extracted from microalgae. For example several chemical processes often utilize chlorophylls phycobilins and carote- noids that are extracted from several microalgae species such as Porphyridium cruentum Synechococ- cus sp. and Chlorella Ummalyma et al. 2020 . Given the high concentration of biological mole- cules contained in the biomass microalgae present an attractive option to be used as a substrate in energy conversion. The production of speciﬁc biofuel relies heavily on the biochemical make-up of the microalgae substrate. For example various species of microalgae with a higher mass fraction of lipid content provide optimal feedstock for biodiesel production Brind- hadevi et al. 2021 . On the other hand microalgae that have higher carbohydrate content are more suitable for the production of fermentative alcohol Phwan et al. 2019 . Notably researchers have found ways to modify the biochemical structure of microalgae species with the help of genetic engineering tech- niques to improve the characteristics of certain strains. Furthermore the growth rate of selected species of microalgae can be signiﬁcantly enhanced with the development and application of photobioreactors in the cultivation process Sirohi et al. 2022b Ran- ganathan et al. 2022 . Moreover microalgae species with high concentrations of fatty acids have been regarded as potential sources to supplement conven- tional petroleum-based fuels and ﬁsh oils. Depending on the strains of microalgae the productivity of biomass and lipid content can vary signiﬁcantly when they are used as inputs for edible oil production Shin et al. 2018b . Despite the fact that the investigation into optimal culture conditions to increase the lipid content from microalgae has been conducted it is unlikely to achieve equally desirable results if the chosen strains are not suitable for the conversion to edible oil Piligaev et al. 2015 . Hence it is important to consider the microalgae species as it is the major factor affecting the productivity and composition of major components such as fatty acids carbohydrates lipids and proteins Xue et al. 2021 . Figure 2 provides nutrients of different microalgae species for the purpose of biofuel production. Previous studies have examined different species of microalgae for biofuel production such as Chlamydomonas sp. Scranton et al. 2015 Chlorella sp. Guccione et al. 2014 Senedesmus sp. Nan- nochloropsis sp. and a combination of various cultures included both fresh or wastewater strains Sajjadi et al. 2018 . Biological molecules found in microalgae biomass namely lipid protein and car- bohydrates as well as the entire cell structure can be converted into biofuels through proven techniques. All in all the development of microalgae as a potential biomass feedstock for third-generation biofuel pro- duction presents a signiﬁcant opportunity and viable solution for achieving a more sustainable energy future. As reported microalgae are found to have a higher growth rate as well as they could ﬁx CO2 with higher capacity compared to aquatic and agricultural plants and traditional forests. More interestingly without any evolution beyond the cells microalgae could adapt to popular conditions of the environment and have a strong growth in the long term Singh and Ahluwalia 2013 . In the growing process photosynthesis is known as the critical basis in the ﬁxation and storage of CO2 of microalgae. Many studies indicated that the efﬁciency of the photosynthesis process for microal- gae could reach 10 20 Li et al. 2008 even microalgae could perform 50 of the photosynthesis process on the Earth Singh and Singh 2014 . How- ever the level of CO2 ﬁxation depends much on the types of microalgae and the environmental conditions of cultivation Ho et al. 2011 . For example Chlorella species were found to have strong CO2 ﬁxation capacity when CO2 concentration ranged from 5 to 20 Tang et al. 2011 . In another case Spirulina species could ﬁx CO2 at a high rate value of 37.9 De Morais and Costa 2007 . Besides it was reported that the use of N. oculata for CO2 ﬁxation in ﬂue gas produced from a coal-ﬁred power plant could offer a high efﬁciency that around 1 3 of CO2 could be removed from ﬂue gas Cheng et al. 2015b . In addition to traditional microalgae many novel microalgae have been developed to provide excellent capacities in ﬁxing CO2. In a study by Aghaalipour et al. 2020 they found that Psammothidium and Monoraphidium contortum species could show a good capacity of CO2 bioﬁxation at concentration 10 . In another report based on the experimental results obtained from 20 microalgae species Gleocystis ampula was observed to have the highest growth rate and CO2 ﬁxation capacity 0.281 g l.d 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1093 Derakhshandeh et al. 2021 . Also many studies reported that a large number of unfamiliar microalgae could offer excellent capabilities in ﬁxing CO2 and producing biomass Song et al. 2020 Ding et al. 2020 Tamil Selvan et al. 2020 Jin et al. 2021 Rodas- Zuluaga et al. 2021 Sung et al. 2021 . In general a critical route from the ﬁxation process of CO2 by microalgae to biofuel production could be depicted in Fig. 3. Critical route for biofuel production from microalgae The existing bioreﬁnery process of microalgae has the potential to yield many high-value products that can be grouped into fuel and non-fuel categories Chandra et al. 2019 in which common biofuels include bioethanol or biobutanol biodiesel biogas and bio-hydrogen. In general Fig. 4 provides examples of advanced methods utilized in the conversion of microalgae biomass to different end-products. Thermochemical conversion Thermochemical liquefaction is a technique that can be utilized at low temperature and high-pressure conditions to convert wet microalgae biomass to bio- oil. In this method the use of a catalyst is optional Arvindnarayan et al. 2017a . Such an approach beneﬁts from the elimination of the energy-intensive drying process. Through liquefaction biomolecules such as lipids carbohydrates and proteins in microal- gae biomass are processed into crude bio-oil. Several factors can affect the efﬁciency of the process such as temperature pressure reaction time catalyst and the natural structure and composition of the microalgal biomass Hong et al. 2021 . Pyrolysis is another Fig. 2 Nutrients of different microalgae species Singh and Gu 2010 123 1094 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 commonly used technique to yield bio-oil syngas and charcoal from the combustion of biomass at medium to high temperatures 350 700 C without the pres- ence of oxygen Yang et al. 2019 . For fast pyrolysis the process occurs at a medium temperature range of approximately 500 C with a really short hot vapor residence time of 1 s. The process has the potential to obtain up to 95 5 bio-oil yield Venderbosch 2019 . In contrast to slow pyrolysis fast pyrolysis has a lower overall energy consumption due to its fast reaction while yielding a higher amount of bio-oil outputs. Furthermore bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis process has a lower viscosity compared to its coun- terpart obtained from slow pyrolysis Tan et al. 2015 . Hence the fast pyrolysis process is more appropriate for the production of liquid bio-fuel in general and much larger industrial scales speciﬁcally Hoang et al. 2021b . After microalgae biomass undergoes either the pyrolysis or hydrothermal liquefaction HTL process the dark brown liquid output is determined as bio-oil. The main difference between these two methods is that the former can only occur under dry conditions i.e. less the 5 of moisture contained in the biomass feedstock while HTL can be conducted using any type of microalgae biomass Toro-Trochez et al. 2019 . Within these methods depolymerization of organic compounds takes place without the presence of oxygen Sun et al. 2020 . The microalgae biomass feedstock is ﬁrst broken down into smaller molecules through various thermophysical processes such as dehydration dehydrogenation deoxygenation and decarboxylation. One of the most signiﬁcant factors Fig. 3 a Microalgae cultivation from various CO2 sources and microalgae processing Zhang and Liu 2021 b Photobiochemical mechanism of ﬁxing CO2 in microalgae Zhao and Su 2014 With permission from Elsevier through LN 5262961242136 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1095 driving the difference in the yield and quality of bio- crude is microalgae biomass constituents. According to Arvindnarayan et al. 2017b there is a high potential in obtaining high energy content from the pyrolysis of Chlorella species of microalgae. Further- more bio-oil obtained from microalgae biomass can be easily blended with conventional transportation fuel without the need for major modiﬁcations to existing engines. According to the experiment reported by Jena and Das 2011 the pyrolysis of Spirulina platensis at 350 C yielded 39.7 23.8 and 19.2wt. of biochar bio-oil and gases respectively. According to Shakya et al. 2017 an experiment was conducted when subjecting nine species of microalgae to hydrothermal liquefaction at 280 C and 320 C in operating temperature and 0.7 MPa of pressure. The study conﬁrmed the highest yield of bio-crude output from the conversion of lipid-rich Nannochloropsis at 320 C. Furthermore a series of investigations by Zhu et al. 2016 utilized microalgae biomass of two different species namely Scenedesmus and Spirulina to produce bio-oil. The authors compared the results from the application of hydrothermal liquefaction 300 C and 10 12 MPa and the pyrolysis method heating to 450 C at a rate of 50 C min to the above microalgae strains. As a result both approaches yielded comparable results in terms of bio-oil output. Notably the experiments obtained 24 45 of bio-oil with a high heating value 35 37 MJ kg . Hence the outputs of the pyrolysis of microalgae biomass depend on the species and the pyrolysis conditions. Moreover the researchers also conﬁrmed the advantage of hydrothermal liquefaction over the pyrolysis method in terms of energy consumption ratio. When the moisture content of wet biomass exceeded 80 the ECR values of hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrol- ysis were measured in the range of 0.44 0.63 and 0.92 1.24 respectively. Recently researchers have made signiﬁcant progress on the development of microalgae biomass pyrolysis to convert microalgae into biofuels. For example one study has successfully obtained nearly 54.4 wt. wt. yield of bio-oil from microwave-enhanced pyrolysis subjected to a CO2 environment when using freshwater microalgae blooms naturally occurring in lakes as the main feedstock Zhang et al. 2016 . In another instance the hydropyrolysis of the native microalgae consor- tium was observed to yield up to 31 of bio-oil under 200 C operating temperature Choudhary et al. 2017 . Recent studies have explored the use of heterogeneous catalysts to enhance the conversion efﬁciency in the hydrothermal liquefaction of microal- gae Xu et al. 2019a Kohansal et al. 2019 . In their study Saber et al. 2016 conducted low-temperature hydrothermal liquefaction using Nannochloropsis as the primary biomass feedstock. The experiments were conducted using three different catalysts including nano-Ni SiO2 synthesized zeolite and Na2CO3 under three different temperatures 210 230 and 250 C . Among these catalysts nano-Ni SiO2 yielded the highest amount of bio-oil 30 wt. followed by Na2CO3 24.2 wt. and zeolite 24 wt. . In another comparable work the hydrothermal liquefaction at 300 C of Nannochlopsis in the presence of Ni supported TiO2 obtained a 48.23 yield of bio-crude Wang et al. 2018 . Under low-oxygen conditions biomass can be heated at relatively high temperatures 800 1000 C to yield combustible gas mixtures in a process known as gasiﬁcation Clark and Deswarte 2014 . The output of syngas typically contains several common gases such as CO H2 CH4 and CO2 Hoang et al. 2021a . Although syngas has a low energy density 4 6 MJ m3 it is highly suitable for domestic heating and cooking by combustion in gas engines or gas turbines McKendry 2002 . In a study by Zhu et al. 2016 they conducted an experiment utilizing both wood biomass and microalgae with a 9 1 ratio in a co-gasiﬁcation process. Compared to only using wood biomass the co-gasiﬁcation of microalgae and wood yielded higher H2 CO and CH4 by 3 20 6 -31 and 9 20 respectively. Likewise Raheem et al. 2015 per- formed the gasiﬁcation of Chlorella biomass at 950 C yielding H2 CO and CH4 up to 2.9 22.8 and 10.1 wt. of biomass respectively. In a study by Liu et al. 2017 they found that the gasiﬁcation process exhibited an overall 81.6 efﬁciency with a combus- tion gas yield of 1.05 Nm3 kg. The authors also conﬁrmed the factors inﬂuencing the cold gas efﬁ- ciency such as steam and moisture content in the feedstocks as well as the mixture of the microalgae substrate to a lesser degree. More importantly the most signiﬁcant factor is the moisture content in the gasiﬁcation and biomass feedstock that affects the composition of the syngas output Azadi et al. 2014 . A study conducted by Diaz-Rey et al. 2015 also has shown the potential to obtain hydrogen-rich precursors with measured HHV up to 25 MJ Nm via gasiﬁcation 123 1096 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 of microalgae. Such a process still faces major obstacles in dealing with the high concentration of nitrogen and minerals found in microalgae feedstock. One way to reduce the ash content in the output has been suggested by Liu et al. 2019b that could eliminate the amount of ash by 67.6 when acid washing the microalgae feedstock with HCL. Other studies also pointed out that the elevated concentration of potassium in microalga ash could enhance gas yield while the presence of calcium could activate carbon capture and deamination Liu et al. 2020a Lo pez-Gonza lez et al. 2014 . Table 1 provides a summary of different studies on thermochemical conversion of microalgae into biofuels. Biochemical conversion Anaerobic digestion is considered to be a popular biochemical conversion of biomass into biofuels. Biogas which makes up mainly of CH4 and CO2 along with a small amount of H2S is the output of the anaerobic digestion process in which microbes break down and convert the organic biomass of microalgae. Typically a constant temperature is maintained throughout the anaerobic digestion process to ensure the optimal condition for the growth of the microbes. The temperature range can be classiﬁed as mesophilic 30 42 C and thermophilic 43 55 C . Most anaer- obic digesters are constructed based on the character- istics of the former operating conditions given their prevalence and stability in the treatment of different types of biomass Gonzalez-Fernandez and Mun oz 2017 . Commonly there are three main stages of anaerobic digestion including hydrolysis fermenta- tion and methanogenesis. Initially simple sugars are obtained from the hydrolysis of complex polysaccha- rides in biomass. Then the fermentation process takes place to transform sugars into alcohols acetic acid volatile fatty acids and traces of H2 and CO2. The gas mixture is further transformed into CH4 60 70 and CO2 30 40 in the presence of methanogens Cantrell et al. 2008 . The measured energy content of the biogas product is 20 40 of the lower heating value of the biomass feedstock. Brennan and Owende Brennan and Owende 2010 have observed the suitability of wet biomass containing 80 90 of moisture as feedstock in an anaerobic digestion process. Several studies have attempted to use microalgae as the primary feedstock for the production of bio-methane via anaerobic digestion. Nevertheless Fig. 4 Different routes for biofuels bioenergy production from microalgae Abo et al. 2019 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1097 Table 1 Thermochemical conversion methods of microalgae to bio-oil syngas hydrogen Microalgae types Thermochemical method Temperature C Biofuel types Yield Heating value Reference Acutodesmus obliquus Supercritical water gasiﬁcation 690 Hydrogen 13 944 kg h Nurdiawati et al. 2019 Chlorella vulgaris Gasiﬁcation 800 Hydrogen 81.6 Liu et al. 2017 Scenedesmus sp.

Furthermore the presence of free ammonia due to the low carbon to nitrogen ratio further inhibits the formation of methane Chandra et al. 2019 . In a study by Zamalloa et al. 2011 they conﬁrmed relatively lower increases in methane output from the digestion of Scenedemus obliquus and Phaeodactylum tricornutum under mesophilic 0.296 L CH4 g and thermophilic 0.462 L CH4 g . According to Trivedi et al. 2015 higher biomass yields are observed in microalgae biomass compared to biomass obtained from terrestrial plants e.g. Jatropha curcas . However the latter has a lower feedstock cost which improves its economic viability. To convert microalgae to bio-alcohol major biomass constituents such as sugars starch and cellulose are ﬁrst degraded in the presence of yeast or bacteria. Further distillation is often required to achieve higher concentrations of diluted alcohol Alves et al. 2020 . Carbohydrates are mainly found in starch reserves in cell bodies as well as cellulose polysaccharides in the cell walls. Jo nsson et al. 2016 have observed a high degree of difﬁculty in fermenting carbohydrates found in biomass in the presence of microbes. Hence it is necessary to break down these carbohydrates into monomeric sugars via hydrolysis using either chemical or biological agents enzymes before further processes Lin et al. 2019 . Neverthe- less enzymatic hydrolysis is less favorable due to the high costs associated with enzyme procurement and the required pre-treatment of microalgal biomass Tan et al. 2015 . As part of the alcoholic fermentation process the monomeric sugars derived from initial treatments of biomass are further processed into the desired outputs. De Farias Silva and Bertucco de Farias Silva and Bertucco 2016 have observed the conversion of sugars found in Saccharomyces and Zymomonas into bioethanol under an oxygen-free environment. Furthermore the fermentation process can occur in two different routes in which hydrolysis and fermen- tation can take place separately or simultaneously in the same reaction chamber. According to Brennan and Owende Brennan and Owende 2010 the conversion of Chlorella vulgaris which contains 37 of starch per dry cell weight results in nearly 65 of ethanol output. In another study Choi et al. 2010 were able to produce 0.235 g of bioethanol from each gram of C. reinhardtii biomass via the separated hydrolysis and fermentation method. Compared to other conventional fermentation methods the use of anaerobic fermenta- tion to convert microalgae biomass into bioethanol is considered a relatively more simple process. In one study Daroch et al. 2013 investigated the use of genetically modiﬁed species of microalgae e.g. Chlamydomonas perigranulata that revealed positive results in terms of bioethanol production due to the presence of self-ferment carbohydrates. To improve the yield of ethanol starch-rich microalgae such as Chlorella vulgaris is one of the most popular strains with the potential to achieve up to 65 conversion efﬁciency and a high bioethanol yield can be obtained from dark fermentation of microalgae at 30 C Javed et al. 2019 . To produce biobutanol the conventional method typically involves the conversion of sugars into a combination of acetone butanol and ethanol ABE Veza et al. 2021 . Theoretically under a controlled fermentation process the optimal ABE yield is 0.41 g per gram of sugar which is slightly lower than 0 5 g of bioethanol per gram of sugar. A mixture of CO2 and H2 gas is also obtained as by-products in the process. The common product ratio of these components is 3 6 1 respectively. Hence butanol accounts for the largest portion of the outputs Bellido et al. 2014 . According to Chen et al. 2015 there is lower productivity in the production of biobutanol due to the strong resistance of degraded substances resulting from the initial steps of the fermentation process. Table 1 continued Microalgae types Thermochemical method Temperature C Biofuel types Yield Heating value Reference Scenedesmus sp. Flash volatilization 600 Syngas 16 vol Gholkar et al. 2019 Porphyra Gasiﬁcation 450 Syngas 87 vol Adnan et al. 2020 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1099 Furthermore there is only a single species of microal- gae i.e. Clostridium spp. that can be converted to biobutanol leading to the lower efﬁciency of the conversion process. Given the fact that Clostridium spp. is saccharolytic the conversion process of starch- rich microalgae into biobutanol is relatively easy as that of bioethanol. In another instance Ellis et al. 2012 utilized biomass obtained from microalgae grown in wastewater with Clostridium saccharoper- butylacetonicum N1 4 in an ABE fermentation pro- cess. In this experiment microalgae that were pretreated with acid and basic chemicals resulted in 2.74 g L of total ABE from the fermentation process. On the other hand a much higher yield of 9.74 g ABE L when enzymatic hydrolysis xylanase and cellu- lases was applied. As reported ABE biofuel has more beneﬁcial physicochemical properties than those of fossil fuel indicating that it could be used as the potential biofuel for engine applications Veza et al. 2019 2020 . Biohydrogen is produced biologically as a result of the metabolic reactions of microbes. Renewable biohydrogen presents a more attractive option com- pared to other biofuel productions. Regarded as a potential alternative fuel biohydrogen is regarded to be cleaner and more sustainable while having a relatively high energy content 142 MJ kg . Biohy- drogen can be produced via different biological techniques including photo-fermentation dark fer- mentation and electro-bio-hydrogenation. There are major pros and cons associated with each of these methods in terms of feasibility sustainability and energy efﬁciency Kadier et al. 2018 Sivagurunathan et al. 2017 . Microalgae have recently gained the interest of researchers as the potential third-generation biomass feedstock for the production of renewable biohydrogen. Studies have reported the use of differ- ent species of microalgae in the generation of biohy- drogen such as Scenedesmus Chlorella Synechocystis Anabaena Nostoc and Tetraspora harbor hydrogenase Eroglu and Melis 2011 Anwar et al. 2019 . Naturally some microalgae strains can use sunlight and water as the source of electrons and energy respectively to produce photo-biological bio- hydrogen. Moreover hydrogen and carbon dioxide can be obtained when subjecting microalgae biomass as the organic substrate in the photo-fermentation process with the help of photosynthetic micro-organ- isms Arun et al. 2020b . In another study a 200 ml L.h hydrogen production rate was observed when using Clostridium butyricum in the dark fermentation of C.vulgaris biomass which contains a high level of carbohydrate in which biohydrogen also accounted for 66 of the total volume of biogas produced in the above process Liu et al. 2013 . In addition biological hydrogen is also a potential power source for electric- ity produced from fuel cells Ban et al. 2019 Eroglu and Melis 2016 He et al. 2017 . In general biofuel yield achieved from the biochemical conversion of microalgae is summarized in Table 2. Chemical conversion Microalgae-derived bio-oils inherently have a higher viscosity compared to diesel oils it is thus necessary to perform a transesteriﬁcation process on the microal- gae oils to lower their overall viscosity before applying to engines Akubude et al. 2019 . To improve the efﬁciency of biodiesel from microalgae the direct transesteriﬁcation method is deemed more favorable. Notably alcohol acts as both the reactant and solvent in a transesteriﬁcation process. Due to its affordability and easy access it is common to use methanol in this process over other types of alcohols e.g. methanol ethanol propanol butanol and amyl alcohol . Given that alcohol is hardly soluble in different kinds of oils the presence of a catalyst is also important due to its enhancing the solubility of alcohol. The direct appli- cation of lipid contained in wet microalgae biomass is another cost-effective strategy to reduce the cost associated with drying and extracting moisture content from the biomass feedstock. Therefore researchers have explored the development of advanced wet lipid extraction techniques Lakshmikandan et al. 2020 . Moreover to penetrate and break down the cell wall of microalgae within the lipid extraction process researchers have applied different pretreatment tech- niques to the biomass feedstock such as high-pressure homogenization ultrasound sonication microwave irradiation Howlader and French 2020 osmotic shock liquid hot water Triton-X-100 application shake mill Ramola et al. 2019 . According to Singh et al. 2019b solvothermal methods were applied to obtain lipids from Spirulina in a microwave environ- ment with a capacity of 750 W at 60 C for 30 min. Furthermore mixing an equal amount of hexane and methanol has been proven to be effective in large-scale operations Shin et al. 2018a .

Presently microalgae are gradually gaining a favorable assessment from experts as the potential sources of biodiesel production considering the rapid growth rates and lipid composition 50 70 Sat- putaley et al. 2017 . Compared to petroleum-based diesel with 46 MJ kg caloric values microalgae- derived biodiesel has a comparable energy content ranging between 39 and 41 MJ kg Goh et al. 2019 . Relatively high conversion efﬁciency 70 75 wt can be achieved in the production of biodiesel via hexane or supercritical CO2 extraction method. According to Umdu et al. 2009 a very high conversion efﬁciency rate of 97.5 was obtained in the transesteriﬁcation of Nannochloropsis oculate with the support of CaO and Al2O3 catalysts at 50 C. Furthermore the addition of Zn Ti and Al- based catalysts in the transesteriﬁcation of green microalgae was detected to yield a 90.2 conversion efﬁciency under 350 400 C and 2500 psi operating conditions McNeff et al. 2008 . In another example the transesteriﬁcation of C. protothecoides along with 75 of lipase Candida sp. in a methanol-containing medium at 38 C resulted in the conversion efﬁciency of 98.15 after 12 h Cheng et al. 2009 . According to Cheng et al. 2020 a reduction in biodiesel yield from lipids extracted with chloroform and n-hexane by as much as 41 and 65 respectively. On the other hand the same authors observed up to a 9 increase in FAME yield from lipids resulting from the transester- iﬁcation process in the presence of TEPDA. Further- more the application of n-hexane formic acid has been shown to improve the biodiesel yield compared to chloroform methanol extraction enhanced by ultra- sound microwave hydrothermal and dilute nitric acid pretreatments. Particularly Xia et al. 2020 observed an increase of biodiesel yield in the range of 79 99 by applying the mixture of n-hexane formic acid at the ratio of 9 2 by volume at 80 C for 2 h. Recently the in-situ transesteriﬁcation method has been gaining traction as an alternative for the conver- sion of biodiesel from microalgae due to the overall lower production cost resulting from the elimination of expensive biomass drying and lipid extraction steps Ghosh et al. 2017 Ma et al. 2019 Mandik et al. 2020 . Currently there is a signiﬁcant amount of interest among the scientiﬁc research community in the generation of biodiesel from microalgae due to several advantages such as the rapid growth rate and enhanced lipid accumulation of microalgae. Further- more microalgae-based biodiesel also exhibits higher energy content i.e. up to 34 increase compared to conventional ethanol Moshood et al. 2021 . Despite its potential further research is needed to examine the practicality of scaling up biodiesel production via the wet lipid extraction method. The alkaline-catalyzed process is among the most prevalent and well-devel- oped methods. However this method is not without its setbacks associated with the high energy requirement the challenge in glycerin and catalyst post-process extraction. Considering the negative impacts from the use of alkaline-based catalysts researchers have proposed alternative biodiesel production methods without the need for a catalyst known as the supercritical ﬂuid method Ortiz-Martı nez et al. 2019 . This new process utilizes a single reactor to convert microalgae biomass into biodiesel under operating temperatures between 250 C and 350 . Compared to traditional transesteriﬁcation and lipid extraction pathways supported by co-solvent the supercritical method requires a signiﬁcantly lower amount of energy inputs Dickinson et al. 2017 . Potential beneﬁts of microalgae-based biofuels The rapid rate of anthropogenic-related environmental degradation in the latter part of the twentieth century has resulted in unprecedented destruction of natural habitats and depletion of natural resources compared to all previous parts of human history Zaimes 2016 . Increasingly stringent regulations are putting pressure on the current trend of global consumption of fossil- based energy sources. Furthermore producers are also facing the challenge of designing products with lower environmental footprints and incorporating more sustainable components into the manufacturing pro- cess. Diverse factors are driving sustainable develop- ment progress namely human cultural political and socio-economic issues Xu and Chen 2020 . These adverse and irreversible consequences are apparent on a global scale that not only affects ecosystems on earth but also human inhabitants and their livelihoods on this planet. Considering this multifaceted sustainabil- ity perspective advances in the ﬁelds of science and engineering could potentially offer powerful solutions 123 1104 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 to address issues related to the satisfaction of current demands without compromising the needs of future generations. Speciﬁcally with chemical production incorporating sustainability elements are of utmost importance in enhancing the current manufacturing processes. Compared to conventional fossil fuels biomass-derived biofuels present a more attractive alternative that is considerably cleaner and more sustainable Cai et al. 2019 . Among various sources of biomass feedstock microalgae are becoming a more popular choice in the production of third-generation biofuels. Microal- gae serves as a promising feedstock in the production of biofuels and other value-added byproducts. Culti- vated in aquatic environments microalgae which comprise either single-cell or multi-cellular photosyn- thetic microorganisms are capable of using water and solar energy to ﬁx atmospheric CO2 to chemical energy into the forms of lipids carbohydrates and proteins contained in the structure of the microalgae biomass. Similar to other plant species microalgae are major sources of carbon dioxide sequestration that accounts for up to 40 of global CO2 Sydney et al. 2019 Kholssi et al. 2021 . As shown in Fig. 5 autotrophic microalgae absorb sunlight during photo- synthesis to convert carbon dioxide into chemical energy. As a result biomass and oxygen are the outputs of this natural process. To produce each ton of microalgae biomass nearly two tons of CO2 along with 0.1 tN 0.010 tP and 0.015 tK are needed. Besides up to two tons of O2 are emitted in the process. Microalgal biomass production has several advantages in terms of wastewater treatment and biofuel production. Several families of microalgae are suitable for the above purposes including Spirulina Arthrospira Chlorella Dunaliella and Haemato- coccus Draaisma et al. 2013 . To ensure the optimal growth of autotrophic microalgae it is important to ensure plenty amount of sunlight and CO2. Previous studies have concluded that 8 10 mol of photons are needed to obtain one mole of carbohydrates. On the other hand the generation of each kilo of biomass necessitates nearly 2 kg of input CO2 Kumar et al. 2011 . The sustain- ability of microalgae production is supported by the use of natural sunlight and atmospheric CO2 or from ﬂue gas Vo Hoang Nhat et al. 2018 . Because of their capability to ﬁx atmospheric CO2 via the photosyn- thesis process microalgae farming can help to reduce the current carbon stock in the atmosphere Acie n et al. 2012 . In their experiment Chiu et al. 2008 investigated the conversion efﬁciency of CO2 ﬁxation in the farming of Chlorella sp. in a photobioreactor. As a result the authors observed various rates of CO2 reduction and removal efﬁciency given different concentrations of CO2. Speciﬁcally the following Fig. 5 The relationship between inputs and outputs in microalgae production Ferna ndez et al. 2021 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1105 rate of reduction g h and removal efﬁciency are provided with the following CO2 concentrations at 2 0.261 g h and 58 5 0.316 g h and 27 10 0.466 g h and 20 and 15 0.573 g h and 16 . Besides earlier studies have shown that increasing the level of CO2 concentration from 5 to 15 could enhance the lipid composition and productivity in microalgae biomass Jiang et al. 2011 . In another study the cultivation of Spirulina sp. and Scenedes- mus obliquus was carried out in a three-stage serial tubular photobioreactor. The daily amounts of CO2 ﬁxed in the process were recorded at 0.413 and 0.260 g L for the above microalgae strains respec- tively Chisti 2007 . In general the capability of microalgae in removing atmospheric CO2 via photo- synthesis can further be enhanced upon scaling up the existing microalgae-based biofuel production Table 3 . Presently it has been estimated to require a signiﬁcantly large sum of money to startup a carbon credit economy. For example if it was assumed a price tag of US 100 per credit of carbon close to one trillion dollars would be needed Bird et al. 2011 . Further- more the annual emissions of carbon from fossil fuel sources are estimated to be around 8 Gt which also equals 8 billion carbon credits each year Bird et al. 2011 . Hence fuels that do not contribute to the carbon emissions stock in the atmosphere can be considered carbon negative. In this sense biofuels can be seen as more advantageous than conventional fossil fuels due to their negative carbon association. On the one hand it would still require the consumption of fossil fuels in the cultivation of microalgae. On the other hand the microalgae biomass itself used as the feedstock for biofuel production is considered carbon negative. In a separate study the application of 15 g of A. fragilis- sima biomass was observed to produce up to 34.1 and 29.5 of carbon dioxide from the HTL and pyrolysis process respectively Arun et al. 2020c . As the CO2 obtained from the valorization process of plant-based biomass is fed back into the natural carbon cycle microalgae biomass can be deemed carbon neutral due to the prior photosynthesis process during its growth. Thus the consumption of microalgae biomass can lead to a negative ﬂow of CO2 as it is taken out of the natural cycle. On the other hand if we compare to the CO2 emitted from the process of burning coal will increase the carbon stock in the atmosphere unless it can be subsequently captured and sequestered Arun et al. 2020b . To ensure that microalgae-based biofuels are carbon negative the cultivation methods should prioritize the reduction of carbon positive sources of energy. Furthermore microalgae are capable of withstanding the presence of NOx and SOx in ﬂue gas as long as the amount of SOx does not go above 400 ppm De Bhowmick et al. 2019 . Considering this dilemma microalgae present an attractive biomass feedstock for a biofuel future Ferna ndez et al. 2021 . As mentioned above common biofuels obtained from microalgae include bioethanol biodiesel bio-oil biomethane bio-hydrogen and bio-butanol that could be used as alternative fuels for vehicle and transporta- tion means with lower carbon emissions Karthikeyan et al. 2018 Rajak et al. 2019 Hoang et al. 2020 . Moreover the sustainability of biofuel production from microalgae on an industrial scale was also conﬁrmed Hossain et al. 2019 . Several beneﬁts of this approach to produce biofuels include a relatively simple adaptation of natural habitat in the cultivation of microalgae without the need of competing with precious arable lands for farming of food and cash crops. Furthermore microalgae also demonstrate the capability to achieve high photosynthesis efﬁciency and high lipid content. Notably the integrated process of generating different types of biofuel including biodiesel bioethanol and biogas from a single feedstock has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve the conversion efﬁciency of the microalgae biomass. Hence it could lead to the improvement in the economic efﬁciency of the overall microalgae biore- ﬁnery process. Current progress made in the area of genetic and metabolic engineering promises to further enhance the cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability of biofuel production from microalgae biomass. Indeed Carbohydrate-rich microalgae such as Zymomonas mobilis Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Chlorella sp. Dunaliella sp. Spirogyra sp. and Scenedesmus sp. present as promising biomass feed- stock for the generation of biofuels O zc imen and Inan 2015 O zc imen et al. 2020 Culaba et al. 2020 . In addition the potential of certain strains of microalgae e.g. Chlorella protothecoides could hold up to 55 of lipid in their biomass structure under a nitrogen- deprived cultivation environment facilitating biodie- sel production. Xu et al. 2006 . Hence the develop- ment of microalgae bioreﬁnery processing is integral to the realization of a zero-emission and sustainable 123 1106 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 circular economic model that can utilize wastewater- cultivated microalgae as a source of renewable bio- energy and bio-fuel Serra et al. 2020 . Furthermore experts believe that biomass can be the single renewable source of carbon-based fuel that is capable of supplying future energy demand. Due to the characteristics and composition of different microal- gae species it is possible to determine the desired product outputs as part of the conversion process. Within an integrated process of sustainable microal- gae biofuel production several stages are highly dependent and interconnected requiring careful plan- ning and monitoring of environmental operational and socio-economic conditions as well as externalities De Bhowmick et al. 2019 . Taking sustainable development into account the shifting of arable land and valuable resources such as freshwater from growing food to energy crops further drives the intense food versus fuel debate. Progress made in the current production of third-generation biofuels from microalgae presents a promising solu- tion to the food versus fuel dilemma. Strong drivers for the transition to microalgae-biofuels are the positive impact on greenhouse gas reduction and saving of valuable arable land and freshwater resource. Indeed the global consumption of freshwater in farming worldwide is estimated to be around 2700 km3 and is projected to rise close to 4000 km3 by the year 2050 Rao et al. 2000 . The signiﬁcant requirements of freshwater inputs in growing energy crops face considerable pushback from the wider public consid- ering the lack of safe drinking water in impoverished communities worldwide. Another adverse impact of farming energy crops is the potential abuse of fertilizers and pesticides that would cause surface water pollution leading to eutrophication and ecolog- ical contamination Deknock et al. 2019 . In contrast to energy crops the outstanding advantage of microal- gae is the ability to be cultivated on marginal lands wastewater and seawaters that are unsuitable for conventional food and energy crops. Besides the conversion of microalgae into biofuels can also gain additional economic beneﬁts from the generation of value-added byproducts as part of the process. To sustain the growth of microalgae nutrients are needed besides sunlight. Due to this reason options to utilize wastewater or seawater that are unsuitable for drinking and farming of food crops could further improve the overall sustainability to improve the carbon footprints of microalgae-based biofuel pro- duction. Provided that wastewater has a considerably higher level of individual amino acids microalgae can be supported in such a medium. Cultivation of microalgae can beneﬁt from using nutrients present in wastewater such as common contaminants e.g. NH4 NO3 - and PO4 3- Ahmed et al. 2021 Vargas- Estrada et al. 2021 . The growth rate of microalgae is less inﬂuenced by the changes in seasonal weather during the year ensuring an uninterrupted growth cycle. Moreover microalgae can be cultivated in wastewater and microalgae farming has a lower environmental footprint because it does not consume freshwater Lu et al. 2020 . Studies have conﬁrmed the capability of microalgae in lowering both the chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand in wastewater. Common species that have been demon- strated to be effective in treating wastewater include Scendesmus sp. Chlorella sp. and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Wang et al. 2010 Kong et al. 2010 Park et al. 2011 . Depending on the microalgae species the extraction rate of metal ions e.g. aluminum calcium ferum mangan and magnesium can ﬂuctuate between 50 and 99 Wang et al. 2010 Woertz et al. 2009 . However Mathews Mathews 2008 noted the optimal thresholds of nickel 1.0 ppm and vanadium 0.1 ppm contained in the ﬂue gas have on the overall productivity of microalgae. Considering all these factors Singh et al. 2011a have concluded that microalgae are the leading candidate among existing energy crops having an energy and biofuel yield measured at 793 4457 GJ ha and 24 355 136 886 L ha respectively Rao et al. 2000 . Furthermore the current economics of biofuel production from microalgae can be enhanced by utilizing unconven- tional sources of nutrients such as fermented liquid biogas liquor animal manure and other agricultural residues Markou and Georgakakis 2011 Samorı et al. 2013 . Beyond the positive economic beneﬁts of microalgae cultivation using wastewater this method also enhances the overall sustainability of the entire microalgae-based biofuel supply chain. Recently conducted Life Cycle Assessment LCA studies on the use of wastewater for microalgae-biofuel produc- tion have also highlighted the improved sustainability attribute. Compared with convention fuel crops such as corn grass and canola the LCA of microalgae grown using wastewater resulted in improving sus- tainability and lowering the ecological footprints and 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1107 subsequent biofuel production Clarens et al. 2010 . In another study Yang et al. 2011 concluded that the cultivation of microalgae using wastewater could save up to 90 of freshwater. Besides it could also eliminate the need for up to 94 of nitrogen consumption and close to 100 requirements of other common nutrients such as S K and Mg. If these strategies are effectively utilized it could avoid the use of a large amount of freshwater and fertilizer while enabling the sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Grown in wastewater microalgae can break down inorganic and organic matters via physical and biological pathways offering an innovative approach to wastew- ater treatment Yin et al. 2020 . Therefore to realize the double advantages of microalgae on top of wastewater treatment signiﬁcant progress must be made in the current technology to ensure the down- stream processing of microalgae can produce biofuel and other valuable biological compounds Ubando et al. 2021 . Overall the practice of microalgae farming is considered much more sustainable com- pared to conventional agriculture due to the nonre- quirement of arable land and freshwater. Microalgae-based biofuel production presents sev- eral positive socioeconomic and sustainability bene- ﬁts. Indeed the value-added byproducts obtained from processing microalgae can make up for the lower capital cost of the overall production. Among these include mineralized carbon and high-value biological compounds. Either one or both of these byproducts can be obtained depending on the selection of microalgae species as the biomass feedstock. In terms of bioactive compounds they can range from ﬁne chemicals to compounds produced in large quantities such as fats polyunsaturated fatty acids oil natural dyes sugars pigments antioxidants etc. Sharma et al. 2019 Tang et al. 2020 . These compounds can yield high economic value due to their diverse commercial uses. Hence microalgae have the potential to contribute to signiﬁcant breakthroughs in different sectors within biotechnology such as biofuel production nutrition and food supplements cosmetics aquaculture phar- maceuticals and pollution control Ranganathan et al. 2022 Suganya et al. 2016 . Among the key advan- tages the development of this sector can be an important economic driver for both urban and rural communities while contributing toward improving livelihoods and advancing social sustainability Pachapur et al. 2020 . In these instances local biofuel industries can be supported by various public and private funding that would beneﬁt the local economy of rural communities El Semary 2020 . The continued progress made in the development of microalgae- based biofuel offers potential employment opportuni- ties for those that already have relevant skills in the conventional oil and fossil fuel industry on their transition to a more sustainable sector Correa et al. 2019 . As existing biofuels continue to face increasing obstacles associated with surging food prices and capital constraints its prospect remains in question which begs the need for a more sustainable alternative. The consumption of microalgae-biofuel can con- tribute to reducing the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere which is an important advantage to the current exploitation of fossil fuels. Continued research and development of various species of microalgae that are suitable for biofuel production can signiﬁcantly contribute toward lowering the carbon footprints and more sustainable energy production and consumption in the future. Future advances in technology associated with microalgae farming and harvesting have the potential to lower fossil fuel consumption and overall carbon footprints. All in all the development of microalgae cultivation and microalgae biomass feed- stock for biofuel production have signiﬁcant advan- tages to the socio-economic and long-term sustainability of communities around the world. Bottlenecks challenges and prospects in biofuel production progress from microalgae Bottlenecks and challenges Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in the development of third-generation biofuels from microalgae biomass. Research projects on different aspects of microalgae cultivation and biofuel produc- tion have been conducted among private enterprises academics government agencies and public research institutions. Nevertheless it still requires a signiﬁcant amount of time before reaching widespread commer- cial adoption of microalgae-based biofuels as the cost of third-generation biofuels is still much higher than conventional alternatives Chowdhury and Loga- nathan 2019 . Based on recent estimates the cost of microalgae bio-oil ﬂuctuates in the range of US 300 2600. Another study also has conﬁrmed that the 123 1108 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 cost of microalgae-derived oil is twice as much as that of petroleum oil. According to Chisti et al. 2007 a liter of microalgae oil is estimated to be around 2.80 not including the cost of distribution marketing sale and other taxes. Among the current literature on microalgae-based biofuel production there have been a number of Techno-Economic Analysis TEA stud- ies examining the practicality of different technolog- ical approaches Vo Hoang Nhat et al. 2018 . Current projections of biofuel production cost are either obtained from past research or small-scale experi- mental studies. More than often the modeling of these cost estimates has not been supported and validated by actual data while several input assumptions still need to be taken into account such as growth rate nutrient requirement lipid productivity and energy consump- tion Chia et al. 2018 . There are more studies on the cultivation of microalgae in open raceway ponds relative to the photobioreactor method which costs between 2 to 2.5 times more than the former process Barry et al. 2016 . Based on current cost estimates prices of microalgae-based biofuel would ﬂuctuate in the range of 0.44 L and 8.76 L Richardson et al. 2012 CARD 2018 . Given these price calculations microalgae oil is not cost-competitive against other convention fuel options. Hence it is necessary to drive down the cost of microalgae biofuels through process optimization and advancement in cultivation methods. In addition further systematic optimization of both production and conversion processes has the potential to drive down these costs in the near future Chowd- hury et al. 2019 . Even though a wide range of research studies have been conducted on biofuel production from microal- gae over the last several decades in reality only a small number of pilot projects have been tested for real-world applications while commercialization has yet to achieve any meaningful results Su et al. 2017 . Currently there has not been an actual case study of continuous microalgae-based biofuel production on an industrial scale. Indeed several obstacles still face the scaling up of production and product commercializa- tion associated with microalgae-based biofuels such as high operation and capital investment cost. Up to date there have been several investigations into microalgae cultivation using an open system and photobioreactors. In one example Davis et al. 2011 has conducted an overall economic analysis to identify potential cost-saving strategies. In the open system the authors obtained 8.52 gal for 25 g m2.day which yielded a cost of 9.84 gal of biodiesel. On the other hand the estimated cost for the photobioreactor approach was recorded at 18.10 gal for 1.25 kg m3.day resulting in the biodiesel cost of 20.53 gal Davis et al. 2011 . Hence it is time-consuming to ﬁnd sufﬁcient solutions to resolve potential technical challenges concerning the development of species suitable for sustainable biofuel production within a plausible timeframe. Among these concerns the structure of the microbial community in microalgae cultures raises the question of the conversion efﬁ- ciency of biofuel production Zabed et al. 2020 . The main issue facing the cultivation of microalgae is the propagation of biomass in the raceway pond and photobioreactor. Additional pretreatment steps and an effective yeast fermentation process are necessary for the conversion of microalgae-based bioethanol. Fur- ther research into the cultivation of engineer-modiﬁed species of microalgae with fast-growing properties is still needed to advance existing bioethanol production. In several case studies the use of automation technology has been cited to signiﬁcantly improve microalgae yield and biofuel productivity. Further- more only selected strains of microalgae containing a high concentration of fatty acids or lipids are deemed suitable for biodiesel production. Hence it signiﬁ- cantly affects the overall production costs Branco- Vieira et al. 2020 . Because of the varying environ- mental conditions and regeneration of microalgae after successive subcultures the quantity and quality of lipid that can be obtained can differ signiﬁcantly. Furthermore the biggest issues with microalgae biofuel production are the relatively low biomass yield and low level of volatile solid compounds in biomass. In the case of cultivating microalgae by wastewater several recent studies have presented innovative solutions to improve microalgae bioreﬁn- ery processes by combining bioenergy production and wastewater treatment De Bhowmick et al. 2019 Chandra et al. 2019 . In this approach wastewater streams can be utilized as the nutrient source in the cultivation of microalgae Hemalatha et al. 2019a 2019b . However there are still several challenges facing the cultivation of microalgae given the different characteristics of various efﬂuent streams such as origin pretreatment processes and nutrient contents resulting in uncontrolled variables in the propagation of microalgae biomass. Even though 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1109 microalgae can process common nutrients present in wastewater streams there are still certain nutrients and inhibitors found in wastewater that negatively affect microalgae growth. Furthermore incompatible carbon to nitrogen ratio could reduce the optimal growth rate leading to lower biomass productivity Li et al. 2020 . Provided the increase in contaminants in microalgae biomass the additional downstream processing steps would increase the overall production cost. These issues are further tied to other factors such as fertilizer costs harvesting moisture extraction and biomass concentration. Despite the major advantages offered by the consumption of bioenergy converted from microalgae the widespread deployment of this clean and sustain- able source of energy still faces signiﬁcant obstacles such as identifying suitable strains of microalgae input resource requirement biomass harvesting sea- sonal variability in feedstock supply and appropriate conversion method. Among these obstacles the low rate of sunlight distribution negatively affects the growth and biomass yield of microalgae culture. Due to the small size of microalgae cells the low biomass concentration further raises the cost of microalgae biomass harvest. High moisture content in biomass also poses another major challenge that would require additional energy-intensive drying stages. Compared to traditional farming the cultivation of microalgae requires signiﬁcantly higher capital investment in facility construction and maintenance to ensure the proper and suitable growing conditions for microal- gae. Concerning the obstacles facing biomass culti- vation and the application of lipid and protein extraction methods to produce biofuels there have been proposals on the development of bioreﬁnery processing that could eliminate the cultivation and harvesting steps within the existing production cycle. In one instance the investigation into lipid-extracted biomass obtained only a third of the amount of biofuel output Quinn et al. 2014 . Currently there are several stages involved in the conversion of microalgae- extracted lipids to biodiesel. On top of that additional use of other chemicals is also necessary as well as extra reﬁning steps are also taken to ensure the quality of biodiesel output is suitable for operating engines Stengel and Connan 2015 . In another example dark fermentation for biohydrogen production is a more complex process that requires the removal of CO2 prior to the start of the treatment. This method also yields a lower hydrogen output. To achieve a higher energy density further processing of the gas output is necessary including drying and compressing to less than a few thousand PSI. However the gas compres- sion method is energy-intensive and such expensed energy cannot be recovered. Besides many other issues concerning bio-hydrogen production have to mention the ﬂuctuation of production yield that is caused by the metabolic variation among hydrogen- emitting organisms Kumar et al. 2021a . Besides the challenge of reducing furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl- furfural involved in the pre-processing stage has not yet been sufﬁciently addressed. The requirement to remove these unwanted toxic contaminants necessi- tates the use of speciﬁc adsorbent materials Sudhakar et al. 2016 . Important socioeconomic advantages such as energy security and independence from fossil energy sources could be realized from the continued devel- opment of advanced biofuels production Gasparatos et al. 2013 . There have been instances in which biofuels have received signiﬁcant funding from public and private sources in several countries indicating evidence among the supportive regulatory framework and the role of policies in advancing the biofuel industries Sun et al. 2019 . Hence there are strong reasons to identify the lack of supportive policies and effective funding mechanisms as major obstacles in maintaining the momentum of the biofuel sectors. Furthermore the inadequate funding also has slowed the transition away from capital-intensive ﬁrst-gener- ation towards second and third-generation biofuels Mathimani and Mallick 2018 . This is a major obstacle that hinders the progress toward long-term energy security and long-term sustainability of the society as long as the reliance on non-renewable carbon-emitting fossil fuels persists Balsalobre- Lorente et al. 2018 . Considering the positive beneﬁts offered by this sustainable fuel resource microalgae are believed to act as an important source of sustainable and carbon neutral biomass feedstock. Several methods can be used to convert microalgae into third-generation biofuels including widely used techniques such as transesteriﬁcation pyrolysis anaerobic digestion hydro-treatment and fermentation Adeniyi et al. 2018 Pourkarimi et al. 2019 Sole -Bundo et al. 2019 . However the current slow pace of development has hindered the progress made in advancing the cost- 123 1110 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 effectiveness of biofuel production from microalgae biomass. Future successes in promoting wider com- mercial adoption of microalgae-based biofuel produc- tion will depend on the effective solutions to these existing challenges Wang and Yin 2018 . Prospects and perspectives Compared to current fossil fuel prices the production cost of microalgae-based biodiesel is signiﬁcantly higher than conventional fuel options. One of the main factors driving up the production cost of advanced biofuels is the high capital requirement associated with nutrients e.g. nitrate and potassium and fresh- water supply for the cultivation of microalgae. Studies have shown that these expenses can account for between 20 and 30 of the total production cost of microalgae-based biodiesel Clarens et al. 2010 Chen et al. 2011 . Therefore the cultivation of microalgae plays an integral part in the biofuel supply chain and biofuel cost. Conventional farming also runs the risk of runoff from fertilizers and pesticides leading to increased surface water contamination and eutrophi- cation of lakes and streams. These environmental issues should be at the forefront of future development of microalgae-based fuel to avoid undermining the environmental and social sustainability aspects of the overall production. Among current research efforts into this sector a credible foundation has been established based on a thorough analysis of techno- logical feasibility and production cost optimization that could serve as the initial steps toward more advanced research and development. Particularly the operation cost should take into account the cost of land production infrastructure harvesting equipment downstream processing ﬁxed and variable operational expenses Beal et al. 2012 Daroch et al. 2013 Javed et al. 2019 . Continued research should focus on lowering these costs. A potential strategy to reduce this cost is to cultivate microalgae cultures in wastewater that has the potential to be more cost- effective and sustainable on a large production scale Ahmed et al. 2021 Hena et al. 2021 . With the use of wastewater as the growing medium microalgae can utilize the nutrients available in the waste efﬂuents. Hence such a process can produce microalgae biomass while treating the wastewater at the same time Yu et al. 2021b . Furthermore a higher level of biomass and lipid productivity can be obtained in the case of inorganic wastewater via mixotrophic cultiva- tion. Indeed carbon is the main source of nutrients that drives the growth and lipid production of microalgae. The use of organic and inorganic carbon can lead to different overall cultivation costs. According to Suali et al. 2012 an innovative approach has been proposed on the use of sweet sorghum as a carbon source for farming microalgae. It is estimated to cost approximately from 0.027 to 0.48 in terms of sweet sorghum cultivation Gao et al. 2010 Singh and Ahluwalia 2013 . Studies have reported the lipid production of up to 73 of microalgae biomass when supplying 25 50 g L of sweet sorghum in the culti- vation of microalgae. Another cheap and highly accessible source of carbon is ﬂue gases Suali and Sarbatly 2012 . Considering the fact that microalgae can reach a 10 threshold of CO2 ﬁxation continued development to improve these positive characteristics will contribute positively to driving down the cultiva- tion cost and lowering global greenhouse gas emis- sions Rawat et al. 2013 . In their studies Mu et al. 2014 investigated different factors involving the production of biofuels from wastewater-grown microalgae including 1 open pond versus photo- bioreactor-based cultivation methods 2 multiple biomass conversion techniques 3 nutrient supply Mu et al. 2014 . The authors conﬁrmed signiﬁcant advantages from using wastewater over freshwater in the cultivation of microalgae biomass for biofuel production. Hence applying the wastewater microal- gae cultivation method can potentially lower the production cost of biofuels up to nearly 50 improv- ing their cost-competitiveness with conventional petroleum-based alternatives. Nevertheless variables such as the nutrient proﬁle of wastewater streams and subsequent biomass processing stages still have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the overall efﬁciency of the production. Due to this reason the potential to effectively scale up current operations further relies on the accessibility and adequate supply of suit- able wastewater streams. Currently there is still signiﬁcant room for continued improvements made to the existing production technologies before feasible commercialization. The fact shows that low-conversion efﬁciency and large input resource requirements e.g. land fresh- water hinder the potential of scaling up biofuel production from conventional sources of biomass. Current advances and potential breakthrough 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1111 discoveries in genomic research of microalgae hold the key to increasing the outlook of biofuel production from cellulosic biomass Brar et al. 2021 . By employing mutagenesis or transgenesis technique the cellular structure and mechanics of an organism can be targeted and altered based on the desired output Gan and Maggs 2017 Spicer and Molnar 2018 . With advances made in this innovative research front new strains with enhanced lipid productivity and concen- tration can be developed through molecular breeding. Besides there are also ongoing efforts in discovering new species of microalgae that offer a higher capabil- ity for biofuel production although these newer strains are yet ready for cultivation and production on a commercial scale. Selected species with demonstrated resistance against potential harm caused by viruses fungi and microzooplanktonic grazers are suitable for cultivation in wastewater. Besides advanced genetic engineering methods can be explored in enhancing the photosynthetic efﬁciency in microalgae domestica- tion. There has been a great deal of research interest looking into the potential of increasing the lipid content through altering the metabolic activities of microalgae and down-regulate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to inhibit the breakdown of free fatty acids in microalgae Wang et al. 2017 Aratboni et al. 2019 . Besides altering the genetic makeup of selected microalgae species the application of metabolic engineering techniques promises to improve the biofuel conversion efﬁciency. For example the use of the carbon partitioning method along with increas- ing the inhibition light threshold has been observed to signiﬁcantly enhance the growth and lipid productiv- ity of microalgae Huang et al. 2020 Bamary and Einali 2021 . According to Zaslavskaia et al. 2001 photoautotrophic diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum was detected to sustained growth in complete lack of sunlight after being interserted with glucose trans- porter genes from Chlorella. However researchers are cautioned by the high environmental sensitivity of the genetically modiﬁed organism when exposed to external factors that could result in unpre- dictable metabolic pathways in which environmental stress can prompt metabolic changes in selected species of microalgae that could imbue the biomass with additional metabolite Singh et al. 2011b . As reported ﬁfty thousand different species of microal- gae have been currently identiﬁed and sampled that offers a wealth of potential resources and knowledge base for continued research in postgenomic technolo- gies concerning microalgae cultivation for biofuel production Elisabeth et al. 2021 . Continued devel- opments in this research direction promise advance- ment in several different aspects related to the cultivation of microalgae including hydrocarbon pro- ductivity and storage in microalgae biomass fast growth rate improved metabolic activities and enhanced nutrient conversion efﬁciency via photo- synthesis Khan et al. 2017 . Future research should focus on examining the effectiveness of cultivating genetically modiﬁed strains of microalgae in an actual culture environment along with advanced methods of metabolic modiﬁcations of microalgae. Furthermore further research is still required to improve the potential to scale up existing operations and success- fully implement industrial modules in the cultivation of relevant species of microalgae. Besides there are also signiﬁcant obstacles facing the harvesting of microalgae biomass. Currently the commonly used technique namely self-ﬂocculation or bio-ﬂoccula- tion has demonstrated its effectiveness while being fairly affordable Li et al. 2021 Ray et al. 2021 . Given its maturity in the practice of wastewater treatment its application in microalgae cultivation has yet to be fully explored. Potential areas of research can be of interest when examining the self-ﬂocculation ability of different microalgae species. Furthermore the self-ﬂocculation process can be signiﬁcantly improved upon the enhancement of mixed culture cultivation and modifying existing environmental factors affecting the growth of microalgae these interesting observations should be further examined. One of the major goals of the transition toward a bio-based circular economy is to ensure equal and fair access to the energy supply of all people while promoting the long-term sustainability of the planet. Compared to other conventional ﬁrst and second- generation biofuels microalgae-based biofuels have a certain important edge in terms of ethical quality because the cultivation of microalgae does not com- pete for valuable arable land and freshwater resource that can be used for growing food crops. However the production of biofuels from microalgae still faces moral dilemmas similar to other types of fuels to a certain extent. Thus in the future one should take into account several elements such as considering human rights justice solidarity sustainability and steward- ship in attempting to formulate an ethical argument in 123 1112 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 supporting or discounting the development of new energy sources or speciﬁcally microalgae-based bio- fuels in this case Oncel 2013 Zhu et al. 2014 Lima 2021 . Indeed the development of an integrated bioreﬁnery is an effective strategy in lowering the cost of microalgae-based biofuel production because the integrated system allows for more efﬁcient oper- ations of the different stages including breaking down of microalgae biomass isolation and extraction of bioactive components and conversion to biofuels. Moreover improvements in pretreatment processes of integrated bioreﬁnery such as harvesting and drying biomass could result in far greater energy and cost savings. The integrated bioreﬁnery can exploit the active bio components of microalgae besides lipid such as carbohydrates and proteins that can be converted into value-added byproducts showing that the increased economics gained from utilizing high value-added by-products from the microalgae-based conversion process can potentially help to offer a solution to address labor and income inequality issues while building a stronger resilience in local commu- nities Atabani et al. 2021 Banu et al. 2020 Goswami et al. 2021 . As part of the integrated bioreﬁnery system the economic value of biomass utilization and conversion is maximized to yield different products such as biofuels chemicals and feeds Stiles et al. 2018 Reno et al. 2020 Morseletto 2020 . Neverthe- less the bioreﬁnery process yielding biofuels and chemicals does necessitate the need for large-scale operations to meet the current market demand for these biomaterials. Hence the bioreﬁnery process should be constructed based on the industrial perspec- tive to ensure the integration of different liquid biofuels output as part of the large-scale operation. To save on operational costs all major components of microalgae biomass should be taken into account in producing various types of liquid fuel due to their different properties. Recent studies have shown the successive production of different liquid biofuels namely biodiesel bioethanol and bio-oil from microalgae biomass Ferna ndez-Acero et al. 2019 Devadas et al. 2021 Bolognesi et al. 2021 . It was found that the extraction of lipid from microalgae serves as an important ingredient in the conversion of biodiesel and bio-oil. Upon the extraction of lipids from microalgae biomass the residues can be sub- jected to sacchariﬁcation and bioethanol fermentation processes which take advantage of the available polysaccharides. To maximize the economic values of microalgae biomass the residual biomass can subsequently be put through pyrolysis to yield bio-oils Lee et al. 2015 . These studies have demonstrated the successful capability of yielding multiple liquid bio- fuel products from the integrated microalgae bioreﬁn- ery process. By integrating co-production and decarbonization of electricity as part of the entire process the obtained biofuel is more comparable to the conventional counterpart in terms of ﬁnancial feasibility and long-term sustainability Adeniyi et al. 2018 . Additional cost savings can be realized from the ability to procure input resources e.g. CO2 nutrients water from less expensive sources Reis and Gouveia 2016 . However in the future new extraction techniques should be further investigated to offer a more efﬁcient way of removing lipid from microalgae biomass even in the absence of lignin. Besides advanced techniques should be applied to allow for the extraction to occur under high-moisture conditions can eliminate the need for a high energy- intensive water extraction process. On a global scale a smooth transition under cooperation and coordination among various stakeholders will ensure the gradual maturation of the sector to avoid any potential market instability. To reduce the chance of market monopo- lization R D results should be made available to the public while the practice of fair trade should be incorporate to uphold the industry s ethical standards Tait et al. 2011 Oncel 2013 . Moreover further investments for R D studies are needed to improve the output yield while also lowering the overall production cost Ferna ndez et al. 2021 . In general applying microalgae biomass as a feedstock in the bioreﬁnery process has the potential to achieve added beneﬁts from various value-added by-products. The integration of advanced microalgae bioreﬁnery with wastewater treatment also has positive effects on greenhouse gas reduction through effective sequestra- tion of carbon dioxide. Several studies have also proposed the use of mixed-biomass feedstocks such as plant-based waste food discard agricultural residues sewage efﬂuents to sustain the continuous production of the bioreﬁnery Brilman et al. 2017 Chen et al. 2014 Wang et al. 2019 . Besides the presence of auto-sedimentation traits in selected species of microalgae can eliminate the need for using ﬂocculants and other energy-intensive harvesting techniques. This will improve the recyclability of the 123 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 1113 used efﬂuents in microalgae cultivation and biofuel production as well as enhance the yield of the biofuel output of the microalgae biomass feedstock. In addition the economic feasibility of microalgae-based biofuel production cannot be realized without the integration of other available technologies. In the future the application of microalgae as the anodic feedstock for the case of microbial fuel cells should be further investigated and exploited. Particularly both the extracted oil content and the carbohydrates and protein-containing in residual microalgae biomass can serve as the anode in the fuel cell system. Particularly both the extracted oil content and the carbohydrates and protein-containing in residual microalgae biomass can serve as the anode in the fuel cell system Ndayisenga et al. 2018 Mekuto et al. 2020 . According to a close-circuit microbial fuel cell system developed by Kakarla and Min Kakarla and Min 2019 the CO2 produced from the residual microalgae biomass at the anode is transferred to the cathode chamber where the CO2 can be ﬁxed by the fresh microalgae. In this instance the microalgae grown in the cathode chamber can be propagated by ﬁxing on the supplied CO2. However issues related to the practical application and commercialization should be examined through TEA and LCA despite TEA and LCA can only be conducted on pilot-scale demon- stration projects on the use of mixed biomass feedstock in an integrated closed-loop bioreﬁnery with a multi-product recovery scheme Mishra et al. 2019 resulting in limiting the potential assessment and prediction of issues facing larger scale commer- cial production. Above the feedstock supply chal- lenge other obstacles facing large-scale conversion of biomass to biofuels have to mention the ability to recover waste after each stage of the process as well as the impact of biomass harvesting methods on wastew- ater efﬂuents valorization. To address these chal- lenges an innovative solution to overcome these current obstacles has been proposed toward improving energy efﬁciency and sustainability of the microalgae bioreﬁnery process as shown in Fig. 6. This new approach also emphasizes the capability of reducing both liquid and solid waste streams through recycling and reusing materials as part of the circular economy. Furthermore the integration of advanced microalgae bioreﬁnery with wastewater treatment also has posi- tive effects on greenhouse gas reduction through effective sequestration of carbon dioxide. Fig. 6 Sustainable approach based on circular bio-economy for bioenergy production from microalgae aiming to reduce CO2 emissions and waste 123 1114 Phytochem Rev 2023 22 1089 1126 Conclusions In this paper the latest update on the current landscape of microalgae-based biofuel research including the beneﬁts and existing challenges for the multitude of biofuels that can be derived from microalgae such as biodiesel bioethanol biohydrogen biomethane was comprehensively analyzed. Regarding the beneﬁts of microalgae biofuels it was indicated that the high ability to ﬁx CO2 in the atmosphere a signiﬁcant reduction of environmental pollution as using wastew- ater as a nutrient in microalgae cultivation and contribution to sustainable development are consid- ered as the main advantages of microalgae biofuels. However it was found that the biggest obstacle remains given the costly energy requirements in the cultivation harvesting and pre-processing treatment of microalgae feedstock resulting in a further increase in the overall processing cost. Therefore possible future research directions should investigate the application of recombinant gene technology to enhance the metabolic pathways aiming to result in the creation of biofuel-grade chemicals. Furthermore interdisciplinary research should be carried out aiming to improve the productivity of biofuel production. Last but not least the integration of microalgae bioreﬁnery processing and the economic practicality of microal- gae-based biofuel production should be further explored in the context of sustainable development and circular economy.

Introduction Carbon dioxide CO2 the famous representative of greenhouse gases GHGs has been observed to exhibit considerably increasing emission levels since the 1750s. Its specific growth rate continues to climb over the centuries and has eventually become one of the most serious envi ronmental concerns. This phenomenon is largely attributable to human activities associated with intuitive or underlying CO2 emissions such as industrialization urbanization agriculture and energy use Ma et al. 2022a . The abruptly increasing level of CO2 has undoubtedly aggravated a series of irreversible ecocrises including global warming ocean acidi fication rising sea levels and multiple extreme weather changes. Moreover it also causes arable and forest areas reduction food short ages health threats public diseases and species extinction threatening all lives on Earth.

Net-zero emissions to balance all GHG sinks and anthropogenic emissions have been put forward as the common goal of global in habitants Ma et al. 2022a . A number of countries have announced pledges catering to the targets of 1.5 or 2 C set by the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions over the coming decades. Except of CO2 emission reduction powerful sequestration strategies to offset emitted CO2 to achieve the above goal also deserves public attention. Many chemical and biological carbon capture and storage CCS technologies were maturely developed the captured CO2 could be stored in deep ocean sites salt-lined aquifers and emptied oil and gas reservoirs deep underground or be converted into concrete carbonate rock plastics and fuel resources. Sleipner in Norway is the world s first offshore gas field that achieved fully operational CO2 injection. Koch Nitrogen s plant in the United States US captures CO2 from fertilizer factory for enhanced oil recovery EOR . While theoretically possible the ultimate CO2 sequestration capacity of CCS technologies is not really as predicted and the cost energy and land consumption needed for expansion is usually unbearable. Plant- and microbe-based carbon sequestration is a newly emerging field that is built on the biological fixation of atmospheric CO2 in the carbon pool in biomass soil forest or ocean through photosynthesis. Biomass energy CCS techniques are greatly expected to reach a CO2 sequestration target of 450 million tons which make up 40 of the total carbon emissions and thus realize carbon neutralization Almena et al. 2022 . The ocean the largest carbon reservoir on the planet accounts for nearly 40 of the natural carbon sink with plankton as the major sequesters DeVries et al. 2019 Gattuso et al. 2015 . With the rise of the blue carbon BC concept additional information on marine plank tonic microorganisms has been excavated in recent decades and the exceptional superiority of these organisms in carbon sequestration and BC storage have recently come to light. Microalgae including cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae are the most important photosynthetic CO2 fixers in the marine ecosystem Tsai et al. 2017 . The most noteworthy advantage of microalgae is their excellent carbon sequestration and biomass accumulation efficiency. Under appropriate conditions microalgae can double their biomass in periods of as short as hours Lam et al. 2012 Singh and Ahluwalia 2013 . Carbon accounts for 50 of the dry weight DW of microalgal biomass. In theory producing 100 tons of algal biomass can fix 183 tons of CO2 Chisti 2007 . The CO2 fixation efficiency of microalgae exceeds that of terrestrial plants by 10 50 and microalgae can absorb CO2 at rates as fast as 440 550 g m 2 d 1 or 1800 tons ha 1 yr 1 which is 60-fold faster than the rates of the forest carbon sink Anand et al. 2020 Xu et al. 2019 . Moreover microalgae show intrinsic superiorities including good environmental compatibility closed nitrogen phos phorus recycling loops and wide species distribution and variation while not requiring arable land or posing ecosystem hazards. The biorefinery concept refers to the processing technologies that acquire value-added bioresources from various biomaterials via economically viable routes. Microalgal biorefinery has been encouraged to be combined with novel production configuration integration to employ efficient carbon sequestration and maximum biomass output. During biorefining microalgae exhibit high growth and photosynthesis rates high tolerance to high CO2 concentrations flue gas low light intensity demand superior nutrient reclamation performance low operating and installation costs and high process controllability Zhu et al. 2017 . The usage of genetic engineering and or molecular tools can precisely improve the employed microalgal strain for better CO2 fixation performance usually starts with genes and enzymes linking to light energy capture Calvin cycle or other CO2 assimilation pathways. Optimization of the biorefining process including cheap medium suf ficient light and dissolved CO2 and special medium components can further improve the efficiency of microalgal biorefinery. Carbon stored in the form of various high-value metabolites in microalga can be the raw material of various high-value bioproducts including food medi cines biomaterials feeds and biofertilizers and biofuels and electricity Rizwan et al. 2018 . Downstream production provides the possibility to obtain extra profits from carbon-fixation biorefineries and avoids the generation of waste by-products thereby supporting the principles of a circular carbon economy and harmless carbon fixation. Given these specific properties microalgae have become the preferred resource of biorefineries for addressing the issue of CO2 emissions. However the commercialization of microalgal biorefinery continues to confront numerous challenges owing to the low sequestration effi ciency and unaffordable energy consumption. In practical cultivation the actual photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae usually cannot match the estimated value due to light energy dissipation Ooms et al. 2016 Xu et al. 2019 . The CO2 fixation rate in practice is only 14.67 18.33 g CO2 m 2 d 1 which is far lower than the theoretical rate of 440 550 g 2 d 1 Huang et al. 2022 . Moreover existing cultivation technologies mainly photobioreactors PBRs are usually energy-intensive and thus difficult to become economically viable. Gas aeration suspension cir culation light illumination and biomass harvesting and processing are the main energy consumers during microalgal production Nguyen et al. 2022 . To conquer the above bottlenecks researchers have made a series of crucial attempts mainly focusing on cultivation process design. How ever most existing reviews in this area often focus on specific aspects of biorefinery design while a comprehensive review that encompasses the entire biorefining construction process is still lacking. This paper sys tematically reviews the outstanding research progress in the past decade reported in over 200 scientific papers in peer-reviewed publications collected by searching Web of Science Google Scholar and Research Gate. The chosen papers presented or made reference to different stages of the process of realizing carbon sequestration by microalgae biorefining covering 1 strain screening and improvement 2 culti vation process regulation and 3 elevation of commercial value of bioproducts. This article begins with a review of known microalgal carbon sequestration mechanisms particularly the carbon concentrating mechanism CCM involved in high CO2 fixation efficiency. Thereafter innovative technologies of strain improvement and phenotypic modifi cation which are represented by genetic and metabolic engineering for improving behaviors in carbon sequestration are summarized. Ad vancements in state-of-the-art processing regulation from different perspectives and their carbon sequestration rates are presented as the key highlight that offers a reference route for a zero carbon circular bioeconomy. This review also provides a discussion of the feasible downstream bioresource and bioproduct production and their contri butions to the promotion of a low-carbon circular bioeconomy. The possibility of coupling biorefinery with wastewater remediation flue gas fixation is explored and the accompanying ecological and economic profits are emphasized. Subsequently life cycle assessment LCA and techno-economic analysis TEA are carried out to evaluate the com mercial feasibility of such microalgal biorefineries. The challenges and future prospects of employing microalgae for commercial carbon- sequestration biorefineries are elaborated in detail to inspire in-depth academic research and engineering practice. 2. Mechanism of microalgal carbon sequestration Before adopting any effective improving strategy it is necessary to firstly have a thorough understanding of the mechanism of microalgal carbon sequestration. The microalgal sequestration of inorganic carbon Ci which is represented by CO2 is based on photosynthesis a bio- mediated physicochemical process involving photoreactions and dark reactions. In general microalgal carbon sequestration consists of three key points light capture and transfer intracellular Ci concentration and photosynthetic carbon metabolism. Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 3 2.1. Light capture and transfer Light energy which is transmitted in the form of photons is indis pensable for carbon assimilation by autotrophic microalgae. Photosys tems including photosystem I PS-I and photosystem II PS-II are the functional units of photon capture during photoreaction and are tightly bound on the thylakoid membrane as shown in Fig. 1. The photoreaction chain starts in the photosynthetic apparatus of PS-II Mirkovic et al. 2017 . Pigments at peripheral binding sites are responsible for photon capture from the solar spectrum Ma et al. 2022b . Excitons that car rying energy are then transferred to the core antenna and delocalized. Photochemical charge separation occurs at the reaction center this process transfers electrons to plastoquinone PQ to generate PQH2 via the chlorophyll molecule s constant cyclic transformation Chadee et al. 2021 Kumar et al. 2021 . The electrons are then shifted along the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and finally afflux into the pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH synthesis. Simultaneously the established proton gradient can form transmembrane potential and induce photophosphorylation thus trig gering ATP production Cheong et al. 2022 . 2.2. Carbon concentrating mechanism system For efficient carbon sequestration CO2 dissolved in the microalgal suspension should be firstly enriched within cells. For this purpose microalgae have evolved the CCM that involves three operational sys tems 1 active Ci uptake systems 2 carbonic anhydrase CA for Ci conversion and 3 compartmentalized CO2 fixation systems Singh et al. 2016 . 2.2.1. Carbon uptake system In culture medium dissolved Ci mainly exists in forms of CO2 H2CO3 HCO3 or CO3 2 . Driven by the concentration difference CO2 can be transferred via passive diffusion across aquaporins. However CO2 has unsatisfactory solubility and diffusion rate. For the acquisition of ample bioavailable Ci principally HCO3 and CO2 microalgal species have evolved multiple Ci uptake strategies which are based on active transport instead of concentration gradients consuming ATP generated from the photoreaction. Cyanobacterial CCM can maintain up to three orders of magnitudes higher Ci concentration around RuBisCo active sites than in the culture medium as a consequence of the formation of efficient uptake trans porters Badger and Price 2003 . Owing to their structural character istics these transporters display different Ci affinities maximum flux rates and autonomous responses to environmental changes or stimuli. Under CO2 limitation HCO3 is delivered to the cytosol by transporters including bicarbonate transporter BCT Ca2+-dependent SbtA Na+- dependent and BicA Na+-dependent at the plasma membrane Fig. 2 Sandrini et al. 2014 . Two NADPH dehydrogenase complexes namely NDH-13 on the thylakoid membrane and NDH-14 on the cyto plasmic membrane act as active CO2 transporters and also carbonic anhydrases Sandrini et al. 2014 . In eukaryotic microalgae Ci transporters exist on the plasma mem brane chloroplast envelope or thylakoid membranes and are generally activated under low CO2 conditions or light dark cycles Mitchell et al. 2014 . While CO2 passes through membranes by passive diffusion and HCO3 transport occurs under the mediation of active transporters on the plasma membrane high light activated 3 HLA3 limiting CO2 inducible 1 LCI1 and rhesus-like proteins RHP1 and RHP2 Im and Grossman 2002 Singh et al. 2016 . Ci transporters on the chloroplast envelope have also been explored. Transmembrane channel low-carbon-inducible A LCIA and chloroplast carrier protein 1 CCP1 facilitate HCO3 transport as active bicarbonate transporters LCIB locating near the pyrenoid which is the unique RuBisCo-enriched microcompartment within the chloroplast acts in forms of LCIB LCIC or LCIB LCID com plexes and participates in CO2 transport and leakage prevention the chloroplast envelope membrane protein A CemA pumps H+ outward the chloroplast to balance the stromal pH Yamano et al. 2014 . 2.2.2. Carbonic anhydrases CAs participate in the morphological transitions of various Ci into CO2. As shown in Fig. 2 cyanobacterial CAs exist only in the periplasm and carboxysomes. Periplasmic CAs such as EcaA and EcaB convert Ci into CO2 for maximal substrate availability So et al. 1998 . EcaA also Fig. 1. Photons capture and conversion processes of microalgae. Abbreviations Chl chlorophyll in the ground state Chl chlorophyll in excited singlet state Chl+ chlorophyll in oxidation state PS photosystem PQ plastoquinone PC plastocyanin Fd Ferredoxin FNR Ferredoxin-NADP reductase NADPH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ATP adenosine triphosphate ADP adenosine diphosphate. Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 4 acts as the sensor to monitor the alteration in external CO2 levels. HCO3 in the cytosol can diffuse into the carboxysome passively and is rapidly dehydrated into CO2 in the presence of carboxysomal CA CcaA . The mechanism of eukaryotic CAs varies across microalgal species. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CAH1 on the periplasmic membrane helps the generation of HCO3 and is highly activated under low CO2 or high light conditions Fig. 2 Fujiwara et al. 1990 . CAH3 is located in thylakoid lumens surrounded by active RuBisCo molecules it catalyzes Ci conversion directly energized by the high proton concentration pro duced from light energy by the photosynthetic electron transport chain Moroney and Ynalvez 2007 . CAH6 in pyrenoids plays a similar role it also contributes to preventing CO2 diffusion Mitra et al. 2004 . 2.2.3. Compartmentalized CO2 fixation system In the dark reaction RuBisCos catalyze the most essential step of CO2 biofixation introducing CO2 into the carboxylation from ribulose 1 5- bisphosphate RuBP to 3-phosphoglycerate 3-PGA Eq. 1 Wu et al. 2022 . However carboxylation efficiency is competitively inhibited because RuBisCo also acts as the oxygenase in photorespira tion Eq. 2 Bathellier et al. 2020 . Therefore CO2 should be adequately enriched near active sites to maximize the competitive advantage of RuBisCo in carboxylation Rivera et al. 2022 . For this purpose carboxysomes and pyrenoids have been developed in microalgae. RuBP + CO2 + H2O 2 3 PGA 1 RuBP + O2 1 3 PGA + 1 2 Pglycolate 2 As depicted in Fig. 2 carboxysome is a specialized site tightly packed with abundant RuBisCos and CAs and its protein shell is permeable by HCO3 but not by O2 or CO2 Cameron et al. 2013 . This structure en ables cyanobacteria with high carboxylation efficiency once HCO3 enters the carboxysome it is immediately catalyzed into CO2 by CAs and cannot diffuse out thus forming high CO2 O2 concentration ratios near RuBisCo active sites. Carboxysomes also exhibit great 3-PGA and RuBP permeability to ensure the completeness of the Calvin cycle. Similar to carboxysomes in cyanobacteria pyrenoids which are wrapped by starch sheaths are the CO2-fixing suborganelles enriched with RuBisCos in the chloroplasts of eukaryotic algae. RuBisCo accounts for 90 of the pyrenoid structure and is associated with CAs that Fig. 2. Carbon uptake systems of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . Abbreviations OM outer membrane PM plasma mem brane CE chloroplast envelope. Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 5 facilitate Ci conversion and enrich CO2 around RuBisCos. Pyrenoids can concentrate CO2 by 5 75-fold more than culture medium this is also associated with the starch sheath that serve as a barrier to minimize CO2 leakage Mallikarjuna et al. 2020 . The thylakoid membrane that tra verses the pyrenoid and forms cylindrical thylakoid lumens is a common structure shared by different algal species Fig. 2 Engel et al. 2015 . Undoubtedly the microalgal CCM strategies that evolved over a long evolutionary course have been firmly supporting algal Ci absorption and fixation thus maintaining vital activities. 2.3. Photosynthetic carbon metabolism Photosynthetic carbon fixation proceeds through the Calvin cycle consuming the ATP and NADPH generated during photoreactions. The first step of the fixation is the combination of three molecules of CO2 and three RuBP to form six molecules of 3-PGA under the catalyzation of RuBisCos Fig. 3 . This step is the standard for conversion of Ci into organic carbon skeleton for this reason RuBisCo has been accepted to occupy the primary position in CO2 biofixation or in other words it introduces CO2 into the whole organic metabolic game. 3-PGA are then transformed into glyceradehyde-3-phosphate G3P via a series of complicated reactions within which the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH acts as the decisive enzyme in the presence of NADPH. Five of the six G3P molecules are recycled immediately meanwhile the other single G3P is utilized to form glucose and other biomolecules via different metabolic pathways including glycolysis gluconeogenesis the tricarboxylic acid cycle TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation Singh et al. 2014 . The third important enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase PEPC mediates the CO2-consuming anaplerotic synthesis of oxaloacetate OAA or malate MAL which is a critical path of TCA cycle replenishment Shin et al. 2015 . Through the coordinated operation of these various metabolic pathways Ci is smoothly assimilated into microalgal cells and partici pates in multiple reactions thus maintaining the proper development and metabolism of algae. While obtaining the significant knowledge above microalgal carbon sequestration especially the CCM system and the components they involve remain incompletely clarified. Given that CCM properties are commonly species-dependent further targeted exploration via genomics are highly expected to elucidate CCM mechanism and offer new infor mation and technology. 3. Advancements in strain improvement for effective carbon sequestration The original metabolic characteristics of different microalgal species decide the effectiveness of their carbon sequestration to a large degree thus imposing application restrictions on their commercialization. Nevertheless many existing biological technologies have been confirmed to screen and modify wild species effectively to improve their behavior during carbon-fixing cultivation. Fig. 3. Photosynthetic carbon metabolism of microalgae. Abbreviations G6P glucose-6-phosphate NADP nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 6PG 6- phosphogluconate Ribulose-5P ribulose 5-phosphate ATP adenosine triphosphate ADP adenosine diphosphate RuBP ribulose 1 5-bisphosphate RuBisCo ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase 3-PGA 3-phosphoglycerate GAPDH glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase G3P glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate PEP phosphoenolpyruvate PEPC phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase OAA oxaloacetate TCA cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle. Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 6 3.1. Screening of species and strains The phenotypic characteristics of CO2 sequestration as well as biomass accumulation are fundamentally determined by microalgal species Wang et al. 2016 . Section 2 highlights the primacy of photo reaction CCM and Calvin cycle in regulating the CO2 fixation capacity of wild microalgae. Chlorella Anacystis Monoraphidium Chlamydomonas Spirulina Rhodobacter and Synechococcus have been characterized with outstanding original carbon sequestration capacity and they conform ably showed active RuBisCo activity Tripathi et al. 2015 . For efficient carbon sequestration high CO2 dissolution rates must be provided during microalgal culture. However not every microalgal species can grow properly in such an environment. Chlorella shows remarkable tolerance. For example Chlorella vulgaris can manage high rates of growth and carbon fixation over a wide range of CO2 concen trations 0.04 18 v v Senatore et al. 2021 . Increasing the dis solved CO2 concentration to 18 accelerates the growth of Chlorella kessleri and Scenedesmus obliquus and this concentration can also be tolerated by some other Chlorophyceae species and cyanobacteria De Morais and Costa 2007 . In addition the affinity of RuBisCo and other crucial carboxylases CO2 varies across different microalgal species and even strains. There fore microalgae show distinct CO2 biofixation efficiencies mainly due to their naturalization in local aquatic environments during evolution. Broadly speaking cyanobacteria absorb CO2 at a higher rate than Chlorophyceae species De Morais and Costa 2007 . In the marine spe cies Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiw CO2 enrichment has been proven to stimulate CA activity leading to the increase in the photosynthetic assimilation rate of Ci Zhu et al. 2017 . In another comparative experiment Dunaliella displayed excellent capability for CO2 fixation and C. vulgaris achieved the highest biomass accumulation Eloka-Eboka and Inambao 2017 . The carbon fixation efficiency of Spirulina sp. could reach 38 Binaghi et al. 2003 . Anabaena sp. also presents high CO2 biofixation rates. Natural strains usually do not possess all the characteristics desired for industrial carbon sequestration and only several microalgal strains are currently utilized. Thus strain screening has become a necessary task. Adaptive laboratory evolution ALE has been developed to improve the CO2 tolerance and assimilation ability of microalgal cells without the problems of randomness and nonreproducibility Wu et al. 2022 . For example the adaptive microalgal strain Nannochloropsis oceanica CCMP1779 established through CO2 gradient acclimation exhibited significantly increased CO2 fixation and photosynthesis rates under 15 CO2 Wang et al. 2022 . Table 1 summarizes the maximum CO2 fixation rates of some representative microalgae after strain screening. Some algal strains possess high CO2 fixing efficiency some other can accumulate considerable biomass under high CO2 concentra tion stress through rapid carbon absorption and utilization. From the perspective of maximum carbon resource utilization both of these ca pabilities are necessary for carbon sequestration microalgae. Whether a microalgal strain can rapidly adapt to possible stress conditions and grow robustly is also a reference standard. Therefore multiple aspects should be considered in the selection of microalgal species and strains and blindly chasing species with high CO2 fixation rates is undesirable. 3.2. Mutagenesis The available ALE strategies lack satisfactory universality or viability for different species Wu et al. 2022 . This situation has encouraged the development of effective and economical biological approaches for selecting and modifying targeted microalgal strains to cope with possible conditions. Random mutagenesis that alters DNA and mutates metabolic properties is considered as an effective technique for the mutagenesis of existing microalgal strains. N -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine NTG and ethyl methane sulfonate EMS have been commonly used as powerful chemical mutagens to induce purine alkylation and pairing errors in DNA. The EMS-induced mutant strains Chlorella sp. MB-9 and Chlorella sp. MM-2 have been proven to capture 70 and 80 of CO2 in desulfurized biogas respectively Li et al. 2022a . In another experiment the mutant strain Chlorella sp. AT1 obtained through NTG mutagenesis displayed Table 1 CO2 fixation efficiency of different microalgae species.

Ultraviolet UV mutagenesis is flexibly controlled and does not require any genetic information Liu et al. 2015 . For example the UV mutant strain S. obliquus WUST4 showed excellent tolerance to high concentrations of CO2 and fixation efficiency Li et al. 2011 . After mutagenesis mutant strains even showed better growth characteristics under high CO2 conditions 15 v v for mutant C. vulgaris than under normal conditions Qi et al. 2016 . Gamma rays γ-rays lead to the generation of free radicals which disrupt biomacromolecules and cause changes in genetic characteristics Cheng et al. 2019c . Free radicals also stimulate C3 compound gen eration and activate RuBisCo thereby enhancing CO2 capture affinity Zhang and Liu 2021 . Haematococcus pluvialis mutants acclimated to 15 CO2 showed increased astaxanthin production and dry weight Cheng et al. 2016 . The CO2 fixation rate and biomass yield of an Arthrospira platensis strain mutated through irradiation with γ-rays from 60Co increased by over 20 Zhu et al. 2020 . Although many successful examples are listed above mutagenesis remains incompletely controllable and might lead to undesired base paring transversions and frameshift mutations Li et al. 2022a . Some technologies such as UV mutagenesis present other exigent disadvan tages such as low mutation rates high toxicity and radiation risk Sun et al. 2021 . 3.3. Genetic engineering strategies Genetic engineering set off a revolution in the microalgal industry and has recently attracted increasing attention because novel and pre cise genetic techniques for obtaining microalgal strains suitable for specific biorefinery scenarios have become available. Ideal photosyn thetic carbon sequestration stands on three major cornerstones the availability of CO2 the activity of RuBisCo as a carboxylase and the optimal intensity of light. Thus the genetic engineering of carbon- sequestrating microalgae currently focuses on i improving the effi ciency of the carbon sequestration pathway ii amending energy- capture complexes and iii designing additional carbon sequestration pathways. 3.3.1. Enhancing the efficiency of the carbon sequestration pathway The improvement in carbon sequestration efficiency relies on the enhancement in the activity of CCM and the expression levels of key Calvin cycle enzymes. Enhancing the expression of CCM-related genes especially those encoding CAs is undoubtedly the most straight-forward strategy for increasing CO2 availability at RuBisCo active sites. In microalgae the genetic engineering of CA demonstrated the positive role of its overexpression which supports the effective capture of sur plus CO2 Effendi and Ng 2019 . The carbon fixation rate of the genetically modified strain Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 improved by 41 Chen et al. 2012 . Mesorhizobium loti with high CA activity was engineered as the expression vector of the highly overexpressed M1CA gene then transformed into C. vulgaris and Chlorella sorokiniana. The receiver displayed improved carbon capture and fixation rates biomass and lipid yields and protein contents Lin et al. 2018 . LCIA was found to be essential for HCO3 transport and cell accli mation to low CO2 conditions. The yield of H. pluvialis with self-cloned LCIA increased by 1.5-fold relative to that of wild strains Sharon-Goj man et al. 2017 . HLA3 also facilitates carbon uptake under CO2 limi tation. When introduced into microalgae such as Chlamydomonas sp. the artificially designed effector dTALE acted as the synthetic tran scriptional activator that activated the expression of HLA3 and increased biomass yield and growth rate as well as the activity of Ci transporters under low CO2 concentrations Gao et al. 2015 . As mentioned above the crucial rate-limiting step of the Calvin cycle is the reaction driven by RuBisCo in the first assimilation of CO2 into the organic compound 3-PGA the primary step of carbon sequestration Ng et al. 2017 . A number of studies have worked on the genetic modification of RuBisCO to increase carboxylation capability and RuBisCO overexpression is one of the most direct tools for reinforcing carbon sequestration in most photosynthetic organisms. For example in Nannochloropsis under ambient CO2 the overexpression of RuBisCo activase increased the level of the RuBisCo large subunit protein by 45 and the accumulation of biomass by approximately 46 Wei et al. 2017 . Liang and Lindblad 2017 overexpressed RuBisCo in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. This approach increased RuBisCo activity and content activated carbon fixation and photosyn thesis and elevated biomass and ethanol production levels in vitro. RuBisCo in Synechococcus PCC 7002 could be overexpressed through natural transformation resulting in the stimulation of pyruvate PYR metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis De Porcellinis et al. 2018 . Photosynthetic CO2 fixation efficiency is tightly associated with key Calvin cycle enzymes especially those determining the regeneration capability of RuBP. Aldolase overexpression has been demonstrated to promote RuBP regeneration and photosynthetic energy transport. An experiment cloned the cyanobacterial fructose bisphosphate aldolase FBA enzyme into C. vulgaris and showed that the overexpression of FBA promoted photosynthetic metabolic capacity by 1.2-fold Yang et al. 2017 . Sedoheptulose-1 7-bisphosphate SBPase is another functional enzyme regulating RuBP regeneration. The targeted over expression of SBPase increased the levels of Calvin cycle intermediates CO2 fixation activity and glycerol and biomass productivity in Duna liella bardawil and Euglena gracilis Priyadharsini et al. 2022 . Similarly the biomass of C. reinhardtii with the pyridoxal kinase gene which controls biomass accumulation from E. coli was double that of that the wild type and the CO2 fixation rate of this mutant reached the highest level of 1.183 g g 1 DW Lin et al. 2021 . Kanno et al. 2017 introduced conjugation modifications into the Calvin cycle and glycolytic pathways of S. elongatus PCC 7942 these modifications accelerated growth and 2 3-butanediol production. In terms of recent research trends the ge netic engineering of pathways related to the Calvin cycle especially exogenous gene overexpression still displays infinite opportunities for microalgae. Although several genetic strategies have been successfully applied to microalgae the precise editing expression and integration of crucial genes involved in the carbon fixation pathway remain an arduous task Priyadharsini et al. 2022 . 3.3.2. Modification of the light-harvesting photosynthetic apparatus Well-founded studies have confirmed that the photoconversion ac tivity and CO2 fixation capability of microalgae are upgraded with the enhancement in light irradiation Melis 2009 . As described above although peripheral antennae in the chloroplast are responsible for harvesting light energy their photon absorption rate becomes excessive at high solar intensities and the excess photons that cannot be used by photosynthesis timely are lost and dissipated in the form of fluorescence or heat leading to a decrement in photosynthetic productivity Li et al. 2022a . In addition to the optimization of light intensity for photosyn thesis genetic engineering has been utilized to weaken the possible negative effects of photoinhibition Zeng et al. 2011 . Large light-harvesting antenna complexes LHCs evolved in micro algae to enhance light capture in stressful environments and shrinking the LHC antenna could reduce photoinhibition Kirst et al. 2014 . In H. pluvialis the self-cloning of the nabI gene the active translational repressor of LHCII proteins increased photosynthetic efficiency Sharon-Gojman et al. 2017 . The LHC gene family of C. reinhardtii could be downregulated through the RNAi technique and higher photosynthetic quantum production instead of photoinhibition was observed under high light conditions Mussgnug et al. 2007 . Theo retically genetic engineering can also be combined with other emerging technologies to truncate the chlorophyll antenna incompletely relieving light overabsorption and simultaneously reducing energy dissipation Carvalho et al. 2011 . Nonphotochemical quenching NPQ could optimize light signaling pathways and greatly promote cell resistance to oxidative stress. NPQ Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 8 refers to the thermal dissipation of chlorophyll singlet excited states and the modification of the NPQ system can enhance carbon uptake and increase cell tolerance to high light intensities via heat dissipation Hines 2016 . 3.3.3. Development of additional carbon fixation pathways Amplifying carbon assimilation is a promising approach to minimize CO2 and energy losses. Rather than solely attempting to improve the carboxylase activity of RuBisCo in Calvin cycle phycologists have recently proposed some respiratory metabolic pathways and corre sponding carboxylating enzymes that can alternatively achieve carbon sequestration. For example reversible reductive carboxylase 6-phospho gluconate dehydrogenase acts as an ideal alternate exhibiting consid erably higher carbon fixation rate and yield than RuBisCo Bar-Even et al. 2012 . But mainstream studies tend to incorporate one or more complete alternative metabolic pathways instead of one single carboxylase. In addition to the Calvin cycle naturally available carbon fixation pathways include the reductive TCA rTCA pathway Wood Ljungdahl pathway WL pathway dicarboxylate 4-hydroxybutyrare cycle Di- 4HB cycle 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle 3HP bi-cycle and 3-hydrox ypropinate-4-hydroxybutyrate cycle 3HP-4HB cycle Priyadharsini et al. 2022 . Similar to the Calvin cycle the 3HP and 3HP-4HB cycles involve aerobic reactions. By contrast the rTCA WL and Di-4HB pathways occur anaerobically. Synthetic alternative pathways also offer customized metabolic routes for CO2 fixation among which the three most representative are summarized in Fig. 4 Berg 2011 . For example the malonyl- CoA oxaloacetate glyoxylate MOG pathway consumes less ATP but has a 2 3 folds higher CO2 fixation rate than the Calvin cycle. It also involves catalytically rapid PEPC enzymes with over 10-fold higher specific activity than RuBisCo 3.5 U mg 1 in the anaerobic conversion of OAA into PYR then into PEP. The crotonyl-CoA ethylmalonyl-CoA hydroxybutyryl-CoA CETCH cycle assimilates CO2 into organic com ponents via the action of crotonyl-CoA carboxylase reductase which has a specific activity of over 130 U mg 1 Claassens 2017 . While the Calvin cycle consumes 7 ATP to fix CO2 into one PYR CETCH cycle requires only one ATP to produce one PYR molecule. Similarly malate thiokinase and malyl-CoA lyase participate in the malyl-CoA glycerate MCG pathway to supply one CO2 equivalent to aid the conversion of C3 metabolites into two acetyl-CoA molecules thus realizing 100 CO2 conservation in photorespiration in theory Yu et al. 2018 . Some emerging complementary cycles also show the potential to trigger car bon assimilation. The formate assimilation pathway in which formate is Fig. 4. The metabolic routes of three synthetic alternative pathways. Abbreviations G3P glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 1 3-BPG bisphosphoglycerate 3-PGA 3- phosphoglycerate 2-PGA 2-phosphoglycerate PEP phosphoenolpyruvate OAA oxaloacetate NAD nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ATP adenosine triphos phate ADP adenosine diphosphate MAL malate MCG malyl-CoA glycerate pathway MOG malonyl-CoA oxaloacetate glyoxylate pathway PYR pyruvate CETCH crotonyl-CoA ethylmalonyl-CoA hydroxybutyryl-CoA NADP nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate TCA cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle. Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 9 oxidized into CO2 in the presence of formate dehydrogenase then con verted into serine now has a highly effective synthetic substitute in the ribulose monophosphate pathway and reductive glycine pathway Bar- Even 2016 . Alternatively the introduction of an additional NADPH consumption pathway can increase CO2 fixation efficiency and biomass accumulation. Genetic engineering in accordance with this approach was performed on Synechocystis sp. which showed enhanced NADPH consumption and significantly increased photosynthetic efficiency Zhou et al. 2016 . Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary science that designs mod ifies and reconstructs biomolecules biological devices and differenti ation processes aiming to construct bioactive components systems and artificial cells or organisms for useful purposes. Genetic engineering can be utilized as the basic research and engineering approach of synthetic biology and genetic transformation methods for different microalgal cells have also been developed and studied to a certain extent. Until now the most extensive mutant library of microalgae is for C. reinhardtii its whole genomic sequence was well-studied and released in 2007 the genome-scale network was constructed afterward Gomes de Oliveira Dal Molin et al. 2011 . The genome sequence supported gene design molecular toolkits development and reconstruction of genome-scale networks Hlavova et al. 2015 . The chloroplast genome of C. vulgaris had been already sequenced in 1997 and the annotation of genes pro vides more opportunities to access genetic and metabolic engineering Cecchin et al. 2019 . Guided by a holistic biological perspective syn thetic biology can certainly realize the modification and optimization of microalgal carbon sequestration. For instance in addition to the above three ways the efficiency of carbon sequestration can be further improved by enhancing the flow of carbon skeleton to specific target products rather than to the underlying metabolites. However the maturation of this discipline requires the discovery of genome-wide and metabolic information of more algae species. Genetic engineering now receives close attention due to the widely available of new powerful genetic tools the genome can now be edited more precisely than ever before to meet our needs. Despite its time and cost input genetic engineering remains the primary tool for strain improvement. In particular the development of more carbon fixation pathways deserves attention as a promising approach to ideal microalgal strains with robust CO2 assimilation phenotypes for sustainable large- scale carbon-fixation biorefinery. 4. Advancements in process regulation for reinforcing carbon sequestration In real-time scenarios bred microalgae have photosynthetic and carbon sequestration efficiencies that usually do not match their esti mated values despite their excellent theoretical CO2 fixation rate. The comprehensive enhancement of CO2 fixation requires not only micro algae with high CO2 assimilation capability after screening and modi fication but also suitable cultivation conditions including nutrients light temperature pH salinity and PBR configuration that are directly linked to CO2 concentration and flow rate. Considerable advancements in process regulation approaches for reinforcing microalgal carbon sequestration have been achieved over several decades of research and discussion. 4.1. Photobioreactor design for enhancing CO2 dissolution CO2 is the prominent element for microalgal growth and fixation. The comprehensive enhancement of CO2 fixation requires not only the high CO2 assimilation capability of microalgae after screening and modification but also sufficient carbon availability in the microalgal suspension. Sufficient carbon availability could be realized by the careful design of cultivation configurations. Large-scale industrial photosynthetic carbon sequestration is commonly conducted in PBRs which are responsible for maintaining suitable environmental conditions particularly CO2 and light levels for microalgal growth and carbon sequestration. CO2-enriched gas is injected into the microalgal suspension through gas aerators. CO2 molecules are captured by microalgae only after they cross the gas liquid interface and dissolve in the medium. Therefore appropriate Ci solubility in the microalgal sus pension is essential for strengthening carbon availability and overall fixation efficiency. Among dissolution characteristics CO2 diffusivity and solubility are synergistically affected by factors including but not limited to the CO2 volume fraction concentration mass transfer coefficient MTC gas liquid contact area bubble diameter retention time and PBR structure Olsen et al. 2017 . Blindly increasing CO2 concentration might cause the acidification of the culture medium and should be prudently used Fu et al. 2019 . As shown in Table 2 scientists now enhance Ci availability via gas aerator retrofitting and PBR installation. The CO2 bubble diameter gas retention time and gas liquid contact area mainly depend on the structure of the gas aerator which injects CO2 gas into the microalgal suspension Cheng et al. 2018 . Multipore rubber pipes are the most common aerators in commercial CO2 fixation refineries owing to their simple structure and aeration reliability Xia et al. 2018 . However they cannot provide a sufficiently small bubble diameter and cannot ensure the vertically uniform distribution of bub bles due to their longitudinal pressure drop. Plate aerators with round stomata are suitable for cylindrical PBRs and provide more stable and uniform bubble diameters larger gas liquid contact area and higher CO2 MTC up to 11.72 h 1 than multipore rubber pipes Huang et al. 2017 . A newly designed 3D-printed fibrous diaphragm aerator with micropores can realize uniform gas distribution thereby improving CO2 MTC by 40 Cheng et al. 2019b . However such an excessively small pore diameter requires high driving pressure thus increasing the energy cost of gas diffusion. The energy input problem was solved through the construction of a magnet-driven aerator. This installation produced bubbles with diameters as small as 2.0 mm and an average rising rate of 0.22 m s 1 Li et al. 2022b . While most designers opt to reduce the outlet diameter of gas aerators to achieve the ideal CO2 bubble diameter the pore blockage increase in manufacturing cost and shortened service life accompanying this choice are issues that need to be taken into account. A promising approach is to design additional functional PBR struc tures to enhance the two-phase flow of CO2 without sacrificing the service life of the aerator. For example optimizing the gas flow channel structure can prolong the gas retention time and changing the gas hy drodynamic behavior can help break bubbles into small ones Huang et al. 2017 . A CO2 dissolver was designed to prolong bubble retention time by inducing the spiral-ascending flow trajectory of CO2 bubbles within horizontal tubular PBRs Xu et al. 2020 . However the helical baffles and other complex internals utilized in PBRs increase operational complexity and manufacturing cost and can easily cause microalgal cell adhesion largely limiting CO2 dissolution in large-scale applications Sirohi et al. 2022 . Given the damage caused by shear force to microalgal cell walls the streamlined design of gas channels with reduced shear force strength was taken into consideration. Combining alkaline absorbents with membrane modules in PBRs can also enhance the MTC of CO2. The former alleviates excess acidity and filters toxic compounds and the latter offers a large gas liquid contact area. Zheng et al. 2016 designed a polydimethyl siloxane hollow fiber membrane that directly delivered CO2 molecules absorbed in K2CO3 solvent to the microalgal suspension. Although the utilization rate in this system exceeded 90 microalgal cells easily blocked the fiber mem branes. An optimized medium in a PBR with 0.01 mmol L 1 zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 nanoparticles was proposed and was found to increase the CO2 MTC to 3.85 and elevated carbon fixation rate by 25.5 relative to the bare case Xu et al. 2021 . However the utilization of absorbents causes potential environmental risks and the mismatch be tween the rates of cell CO2 consumption and CO2 adsorption complicates efficient absorbent recycling thus restricting its applications in practical Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 10 scenarios. Prolonging the bubble retention time is another solution to inade quate Ci dissolution. The retention time is affected by the rising pathway and velocity of bubbles. Most studies in recent decades have tended to place the aerator at the bottom of PBRs or the open ponds to prolong the bubble rising path and retention time the highest carbon fixation effi ciency obtained through this approach could reach 56 Fu et al. 2019 . Alteration into a closed raceway pond further increased carbon fixation efficiency which reached the record of 95 under intermittent operation 10 s 10 s . Several closed PBRs for prolonging retention time have been newly constructed. Ye et al. 2018 designed an airlift column PBR equipped with a string lantern-shaped draft tube which had a bent shape that extended the rising path of CO2 bubbles. Generally speaking these approaches have the common shortcoming of exorbitant aeration costs owing to the involvement of an airlift-driven PBR or a raceway pond with supersized volume. Microbubbles refer to bubbles with a diameter of 20 C leads to the low solubility of CO2 in micro algal suspensions thus directly limiting Ci uptake availability. From a biochemical standpoint temperature participates in regulating cyto plasmic viscosity enzymatic activity protein uptake affinities and a series of metabolic processes. Low temperature could inhibit the affinity of RuBisCo to CO2 and decrease photosynthesis and biosequestration rates by over 30 Zeng et al. 2011 . An early review emphasized that although the common temperature range for microalgal culture is 15 C 30 C with optimal values at 20 C 25 C the optimal operating temperature is strain- and environment-dependent and requires targeted investigation therefore a general industry standard cannot be easily provided Ras et al. 2013 . For example Heo et al. 2015 found that the optimal temperature for CO2 sequestration in Parachlorella sp. cultivated in ambient air was 30 C but decreased to 24 C 25 C with CO2 injection. The influence of pH on carbon sequestration efficiency is derived from its regulation of dissolved Ci species CO2 HCO3 and CO3 2 microalgal CCM system performance and RuBisCo catalytic activity. Under alkaline conditions pH 9 11 Ci prevalently exists in various carbonate forms among which HCO3 is bioaccessible to microalgal uptake transporters. Meanwhile the rise in pH was assumed to result in the increase in the activity of photosynthesis-related enzymes such as extracellular CAs which further stimulated CCM function efficiency Kassim and Meng 2017 . The greater selectivity of RuBisCo for CO2 instead of O2 at the pH of 7.5 results in excellent carboxylase activity and HCO3 uptake consumes less energy when the pH is further increased to 8.5 Veaudor et al. 2020 . The pH optima and tolerance are species- dependent. Normally microalgae are cultured under neutral-to-slightly alkaline conditions pH 6 8.3 but some organisms prefer extreme conditions Morales et al. 2018 . Spirulina grows and accumulates neutral lipids under highly alkaline conditions pH 9 11 whereas acidic conditions are suitable for the growth of Ochromonas sp. Chlamydomonas acidophila Euglena mutabilis and some filamentous algae Novis and Harding 2007 . Furthermore pH varies in relation to Ci dissolution conversion and uptake. Microalgal CO2 uptake and photosynthesis can promote the increase in pH owing to the release of hydroxyl ions OH during the conversion of HCO3 into CO2 by CAs Shiraiwa et al. 1993 . When using flue gases as the CO2 source the dissolution of acidic chemicals such as SO2 or NOx contributes to the reduction in pH value Morales et al. 2018 . Consequently pH control is critical for microalgal carbon fixation culture. Although the adoption of buffers or neutralizing agents is feasible the design of CO2 injection strategies is a more economic approach. 4.3.2. Medium composition The culture medium whether specially formulated or recovered from inexpensive bioresources offers abundant nutrients to algal cells and makes effect on stimulating CO2 fixation. The major essential components include nitrogen phosphorus cyanocobalamin vitamins biotin and diverse metals Table 4 . An adequate supply of nitrogen as the second major component of microalgal growth guarantees the primary metabolite production and cell growth of microalgae Ma et al. 2020 . Inadequate nitrogen supply limits chlorophyll biosynthesis badly affecting photosynthesis. How ever given that high concentrations of nitrogen especially NH4 + might be toxic to cells the appropriate selection of the nitrogen source and concentration is a necessary task Razzak et al. 2017 . The carbon ni trogen ratio is another important issue. Bilanovic et al. 2009 proposed that the maximal biomass production and carbon fixation rate of freshwater algae was observed at the nitrogen concentration of 285 427 mgN L 1 and CO2 concentration of 70 . Phosphorus is significantly associated with photophosphorylation and energy transport because it is an indispensable component of ATP phospholipids and the proteins involved in photosynthesis especially Table 4 Nutrient composition functions in microalgae Zeng et al. 2011 . Composition Main nutrient Functions Recommended concentration Carbon CO2 H CO3 Carbon skeleton synthesis of most cellular substances 1 10 g L 1 Nitrogen NO3 NH4 + N2 urea Synthesis of nucleic acids amines proteins chlorophyll phycocyanin 10 2000 mg L 1 Phosphorous Hydrophosphate phosphate Backbone synthesis of DNA RNA ATP phospholipids amino acids proteins coenzymes Aid to metabolism and fission 10 500 mg L 1 Sulfur Sulfate Amino acids synthesis methionine and cysteine 1 200 mg L 1 Inorganic salts K Ca Na Mg etc. Maintenance of cell structure and activity 0.1 100 mg L 1 Trace elements Fe Zn Mn Pb Cd etc. Coenzyme factors pigment compositions 0.01 10 mg L 1 Vitamins Vitamin B C E etc. Aid to cell division 10 2 103 μg L 1 Phytohormones Auxin cytokinin CK abscisic acid ABA gibberellin GA ethylene ET salicylic acid SA Aid to cell division and metabolism avoid inhibiting effect of abiotic stresses 10 8 10 5 mol L 1 Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 13 RuBisCo Wang et al. 2008 . Although many studies have proven that nitrogen or phosphorus limitation stimulates the storage of compounds with high energy content it limits the specific CO2 capture rate. Furthermore the appropriate supply rate of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations N P greatly influences microalgal growth. Fu et al. 2016 constructed a novel PBR with anion exchange membranes to control the stability of N P ratio. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the nu trients most readily available from low-cost substrates a vary of in dustrial by-products and wastewater were utilized as inexpensive medium. Ermis et al. 2022 used anaerobic liquid digestate to grow microalgae from Diphylleia Synechocystis Cyanobium and Chlorella species and their polyunsaturated fatty acids contents were found increased significantly which was explained by a beneficial response to extreme conditions. Metals such as iron magnesium calcium and copper are consid ered to be indispensable for maintaining cellular metabolism and functions in microalgae Gallo et al. 2020 . Iron is an essential nutrient in all photosynthetic organisms. It participates in nitrogen fixation DNA synthesis respiration and most importantly the fundamental enzy matic reactions of photosynthesis Sajjadi et al. 2018 . Mg2+ is a structural component of chlorophyll molecules and its level affects the in vivo activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and the PYR dehydrogenase complex which directly regulate central carbon metabolism Volgush eva et al. 2015 . Calcium participates in the signal transduction of environmental stimuli and intracellular Ca2+ levels can mediate lipid biosynthesis Sajjadi et al. 2018 . Copper participates in signal trans duction as an element of photosynthetic electron transport proteins and induces the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes that catalyze the synthesis and storage of carbon metabolites Guo et al. 2021 . All the metals mentioned above can be recovered from industrial wastewater at low cost as an effective way to simultaneously treat wastewater pollu tion. Although heavy metals such as cadmium chromium lead mer cury and arsenic could impair photosynthesis and inhibit enzyme activity some previous studies have emphasized their potential to stimulate microalgal carbon sequestration You et al. 2022 . Le on-Vaz et al. 2021 proposed that in C. sorokiniana cadmium leads to the upregulation of photosynthetic metabolism and antioxidant reactions. Microalgae can bioremediate heavy metals by converting them into specific complexes such a capability is a very competitive feature in wastewater treatment industry. Supplying phytohormones among which indole-3-acetic acid has an outstanding effect at low concentrations 10 8 10 5 mol L 1 can also improve CO2 fixation and promote microalgal growth rates Chen et al. 2023 . The effects of phytohormones on microalgae are specific to species and strains. For example Chlorella sp. displays the most signif icant regulation by phytohormones. Generally the investigation of the contributions of phytohormones to microalgal carbon sequestration is accompanied by the optimization of light conditions and nitrogen sources. In conclusion medium formulation plays a decisive role in micro algal growth rates and productivity and has an important role in large- scale industrial carbon sequestration. An ideal nutrition formulation should take into account carbon sequestration efficiency operational difficulty economic costs and potential environmental risks and sub stantial efforts should be made to develop waste and by-products to offer inexpensive nutrients. 5. Sustainable microalgal biorefinery While achieving efficient carbon sequestration microalgae bio refinery is also encouraged as the powerful supplier of bioenergy and multiple bioproducts for human society and production Sun et al. 2021 . An appreciate end-product export of microalgae biorefinery is also essential for enhancing its economic benefit and finally forming a complete commercial chain. Governments of various countries have shown positive support for microalgae biorefineries in 2022 China has 150 related microalgae companies while Europe has about 480 and the US has many more. This section summarized the beneficial micro algal biorefinery products that extensively participate in human life Fig. 5 and the latest research progress of the approaches for improving output value. 5.1. Microalgal biorefinery for energy supply The exploitation of bioenergy has entered the limelight as a prom ising solution to dealing with CO2 excess emission and the energy crisis. China the European Union EU and the US have all introduced policies to encourage the usage of bioenergy and China implements a policy of excise tax exemption and 70 Value-added Tax VAT return for bio diesels that meet national standards. Microalgal biorefineries can harness solar energy to fix CO2 as organic energy materials in forms of biodiesel bioalcohol biochar biohydrogen and biogas or generate electricity via photosynthesis riding into the forefront of sustainable bioenergy resources Tanvir et al. 2021 . 5.1.1. Liquid biofuels Microalgae commonly used in carbon sequestration such as Chlor ella and Chlamydomonas display remarkable lipid and carbohydrate contents and have sparked wide interest as promising biodiesel and bioalcohol sources. Biodiesel has highly similar physical and chemical properties as crude oil-derived diesel Rodionova et al. 2017 . Microalgal refineries can deliver lipid-rich biomass as the novel substrate for biodiesel pro duction with strong commercial competitiveness Voloshin et al. 2016 . Strains from Chlorella Scenedesmus Chlamydomonas and Nanno chloropsis are favored for biodiesel production because of their high lipid contents Ho et al. 2014 . N. salina was indicated to have a lipid content up to 50 of its DW. In terms of energy efficiency the net energy ratio NER of N. salina biodiesel was calculated to be 0.93 megajoule MJ of energy consumed per MJ of energy produced expressed as MJ MJ . This indicated that N. salina biodiesel required approximately 30 less energy input per unit of product compared to soybean-based biodiesel Tanvir et al. 2021 . A number of studies have been devoted to species improvement and culture strategy intensification to enhance biodiesel production. Inhibiting the activity of ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase elevated triacylglycerol production by 10-fold Tanvir et al. 2021 . Mutant Thalassiosira pseudonana with lipase phospholipase acyl transferase knockout exhibited a 3-fold higher lipid productivity than the wild type Trentacoste et al. 2013 . In process regulation nitrogen stress and high initial iron concentrations are beneficial to increase lipid content. In a practice case regulating nitrogen-limitation severity was effective to induce triacylglycerol accumulation Rai et al. 2021 . The team of National Renewable Energy Lab of the US found that the NER of Galdieria sulphuraria cultured in photobioreactor and covered pond systems were respectively 2.21 and 0.25 MJ MJ and displayed global warming potential of 339 and 9.1 g CO2-eq. MJ 1 on a well-to-wheels basis Somers et al. 2021 . Nonetheless the production cost of micro algal biodiesel 1.19 L 1 was 2.42-fold higher than that of petrodiesel mainly attributed to extracting technologies involving energy-intensive methods Wu et al. 2022 . Microalgal-derived low-cost alcohol shows outstanding fuel quality and heating values 19.6 MJ L 1 for bioethanol and 29.2 MJ L 1 for biobutanol while consuming less energy for production than biodiesel Chen et al. 2015 . Ideal bioalcohol substrates especially Spirulina Chlorella Scenedesmus Chlorococcum Chlamydomonas and Porphyridium species have impressive carbohydrates accumulating capacity particu larly glycogen for cyanobacteria and starch for eukaryotic algae John et al. 2011 . For example C. vulgaris can afford 40 w w ethanol productivity on the basis of its biomass Lee et al. 2011 . With algal biomass as the fermentation substrate bacteria or sepa rate enzymes are employed for bioethanol or biobutanol generation. For example Chlorococcum infusionum biomass was utilized by the Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 14 hydrolytic reagent NaOH. The biomass was then subjected to fermen tation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulting in a bioethanol yield of 26.1 g ethanol g biomass Tanvir et al. 2021 . Similarly biobutanol synthesis can occur via acetone butanol ethanol fermentation by sac charolytic butyric acid-producing microorganisms Abomohra and Elshobary 2019 . To increase energy efficiency a direct bioethanol synthesis pathway can be established in microalgae by gene cloning technique. Dexter and Fu 2009 integrated the PDHC and alcohol de hydrogenase II genes from Zymomonas mobilis to transform Synechocystis sp. and found that the created Synechocystis PCC 6803 strain displayed enhanced carbon utilization and unprecedented self-production capa bility for bioethanol. Scientists also proposed a strategy to produce biodiesel and bioethanol simultaneously from the biomass of Saccharo myces bayanus in which lipids and carbohydrates were divided before fermentation Harun et al. 2010 . On the other hand the major draw back of bioethanol industry is the by-production of CO2 which obvi ously decreases the overall carbon sequestration efficiency. 5.1.2. Gaseous biofuels Fresh or lipid-extracted microalgal biomass can be utilized for gaseous biofuel production. Hydrogen H2 gas is distinguished by its renewability pollution-free combustion product only water and heating value of up to 142 MJ kg 1 or 10.1 MJ L 1 when liquefied Khetkorn et al. 2017 . During photosynthesis microalgae release H2 via direct Eq. 3 or indirect biophotolysis Eqs. 4 5 and the latter is mediated by nitrogenase-based systems Junior et al. 2020 Klinthong et al. 2015 . Botryococcus Chlamydomonas Chlorococcum Chlorella Scenedesmus Nostoc and Anabaena are the star producers in biohydrogen factory and the last two species also exhibit nitrogen-fixing capacity Eroglu and Melis 2011 Khanna et al. 2016 . Anaerobe fermentation can also be established to produce biohydrogen from microalgal biomass enriched with carbohydrates. The employed anaerobes such as Clos tridiaceae and Enterobactericeae light-independently synthesize hydrogen from glucose starch or arabinose Ardo et al. 2022 Walig orska 2012 . 2H20 + Light O2 + Fd reduced + 4e Fd oxidezed + 2H2 3 6H2O + 6CO2 + Light C6H12O6 + 6O2 4 C6H12O6 + 2H2O 4H2 + 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 5 Various biotechnology approaches have been used to improve hydrogen production. For example the hydrogen-uptake hydrogenase of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria was inactivated to improve net H2 productivity Khetkorn et al. 2017 . The redirection of electrons to the hydrogenase enzyme could elevate hydrogen productivity by 5-fold Rumpel et al. 2014 . The C. reinhardtii tla1 strain CC-4169 with a truncated light-harvesting antenna showed 4 6 times higher H2 output than its parental strain Kosourov et al. 2011 . In consideration of the extreme O2 sensitivity of hydrogenase sulfur-deprivation stress was applied to increase respiration rates to reduce oxygen sensitivity Shuba and Kifle 2018 . Microalgal immobilization for example immobiliza tion using alginate films could enhance hydrogen production by restricting O2 diffusion into the matrix Nagarajan et al. 2017 . Despite its sufficient theoretical feasibility the commercial applica tion of biophotolysis is still in a rather early research state and holds low technology readiness level. The use of expensive equipment and com plex processes to achieve the best productivity has been proposed but will undoubtedly increase operating costs. Even under optimal condi tions biohydrogen production costs 3 6 USD kg 1 whereas traditional methane gas production only costs 1 USD kg 1 Kosourov et al. 2011 . Biogas is a renewable energy source highly accord with carbon emission reduction principle. When combusted methane the main component of biogas releases 21-fold higher heat energy than CO2. The first attempt at obtaining microalgae-derived biogas dates back to the early 1950s when scientists found that residual microalgal biomass for lipid extraction could be utilized for methane production through anaerobic digestion Baicha et al. 2016 . Microalgae provided 7 13 higher methane yield than corn the typical source of biogas Zabed et al. 2020 . Biogas factories require microalgae with high growth rates thin cell walls high environmental adaptability and sufficient cyto plasmic components as digestion substrates Tijani et al. 2015 . Strains of Chlamydomonas Synechococcus Dunaliella Euglena Spirulina platensis and cyanobacterium A. platensis showed great biogas yields Baicha et al. 2016 . Strain screening biomass pretreatment and digestion condition regulation technologies affect biogas production to a large extent Zabed et al. 2020 . Although numerous studies have been carried out to optimize biogas yield and total carbon fixation contribution biogas production remains at the pilot-scale step and its commercialization is yet to be exploited Su et al. 2017 . Its major drawback is the expensive Fig. 5. Sustainable microalgae biorefinery participates in net zero carbon cycle. Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 15 biomass harvesting dewatering and concentration costs. The eco nomics and energy consumption of the latest optimized recovery methods remain unaffordable. Additionally given that this biotech nology is generally combined with industrial wastewater treatment its potential nutrient limitation and toxic risk cannot be neglected Zabed et al. 2020 . 5.1.3. Solid biofuels Given that microalgae-derived biological liquid and fuels involve complex downstream stages that cannot avoid CO2 emissions and energy expenditure microalgal bioenergy production for carbon neutrality is now shifting to another field direct biomass combustion Clarens et al. 2011 . The use of Scenedesmus sp. Oscillatoria sp. Stigonematales sp. Rhizoclonium spp. or C. vulgaris biomass as solid biofuels has been recognized as a simple method for obtaining high utilization efficiency with low net CO2 emissions Yang et al. 2022 . This technology directly simplifies the downstream processes associated with carbon re- emissions and shows great potential in terms of energy and carbon emission reduction Choi et al. 2019 . 5.1.4. Microbial fuel cells Since the early 1990s microbial fuel cell MFC devices have received algologists attention because of their simultaneous efficient energy production and wastewater treatment capacities. In contrast to other bioenergy technologies fuel cells offer direct and reliable energy production by avoiding the combustion process and do not require additional energy sources or expensive feedstock storage and exert a low pollution impact Sarathi and Nahm 2013 . Under light illumination microalgal organisms can be used as substrates at the anode to capture the CO2 generated at the cathode and transform the chemical energy of organic matter in wastewater into electricity via photosynthesis Walter et al. 2015 . Meanwhile phototrophic microalgae at the cathode can contribute to oxygen production and capture generated CO2 as carbon sources. Many advances have been achieved in terms of new materials chamber design low-cost catalysts and substrates to reduce the oper ating costs and expand the application range of MFCs. An MFC con structed with S. cerevisiae in its anodic chamber and C. vulgaris in its cathode can utilize the CO2 generated in the cathode for algal growth and finally produce 2.7 mW m 2 cathode energy Baicha et al. 2016 . Similar to biophotolysis the research depth of MFC is rather immature. As a result of the novel advancements in biorefinery techniques carbon-fixing microalgae have become desirable substrates for a clean and renewable bioenergy supply. However the comprehensive planning and evaluation of specific production strategies are needed before formal commercialization to identify their commercial viability and environmental and economic benefits. Many factors should be consid ered if the optimal productivity of microalgal-based biofuels is required. In general the future prospects of microalgae-based biofuels mainly depend on advancements in the field of genetic engineering. 5.2. Microalgal refinery for high-value products Microalgal cells accumulate abundant bioactive compounds through carbon sequestration and assimilation. This capacity endows microalgal refineries with positive capacity to become the source of value-added products in the fields of food nutritient supply medicine agriculture chemistry and cosmetics. Some of the major applied species include Spirulina Chlorella Dunaliella and Isochrysis. 5.2.1. Health-care products Carbon fixed in microalgal biomass exists in the forms of diverse bio- compounds which have all been deeply excavated for their biological activities and physiological effects including antioxidant anticancer neuroprotective immunity boosting and adjuvant therapeutic effects in multiple diseases Halperin-Sternfeld et al. 2022 . The addition of these bioactive compounds to food dietary supplements or even medicine for their potential health benefits is desired by the public. China the US and the EU have established strict management regulations and execution standards for food additives or nutrient supplements from conventional microalgae species including Chlorella Spirulina Dunaliella Nanno chloropsis Aphanizomenon and Nostoc. For example the approval and usage of microalgal extracts as new resource foods and additives are subject to the New Resource Food Approval Regulation EU 2015 2283 and the New Resource Food Regulation EU 2018 102 in the EU. The protein and essential amino acid contents of microalgae have been reported to be similar to those of animal-based sources. Chaeto ceros Anabaena Chlorella Dunaliella Scenedesmus and Synechococcus sp. show excellent protein content and quality Becker 2013 . Micro algal proteins with abundant health benefits can be processed into intact cells protein concentrates hydrolysates or bioactive peptides and added to food or pharmaceutical products Soto-Sierra et al. 2018 . Carbohydrates are the main products of photosynthesis. Strains from Porphyridium Isochrysis Dunaliella salina and Spirogyra sp. have particularly prominent carbohydrate contents Rizwan et al. 2018 . Polysaccharides from Dunaliella Haematococcus Porphyridium Chlorella and Spirulina exhibit antioxidant immunomodulatory antitumor hypolipidemic antiasthmatic and anticoagulant properties Colusse et al. 2022 . Algologists have also become aware of the potential of microalgae polysaccharides as prebiotic compounds Camacho et al. 2019 . Under certain culture conditions high C N ratios temperatures or salinity levels or nitrogen starvation microalgae can accumulate a considerable amount of lipids approximately 30 50 of their DW . Microalgae have long been recognized as a suitable alternative producer of essential fatty acids especially docosahexaenoic acid DHA and eicosatetraenoic acid EPA which is a critical bioactive nutrient endowed with multiple health benefits Mason et al. 2020 . The EPA- and DHA-enriched alga Nannochloropsis oculata has been applied in the pharmaceutical field on a large scale by Aurora Algae of the US Liu et al. 2022 . Crypthecodinium Tetraselmis Isochrysis Thalassiosira Nannochloropsis and Ulkenia sp. are also suitable for competitive in dustrial DHA production Suganya et al. 2016 . Natural pigments which are synthesized and accumulated in cells are major participants in microalgal photosynthesis and oxidative stress regulation. Carotenoids have strong antioxidant and colorant ability and have maintained a high market price over several decades Yusof et al. 2022 . β-Carotene and astaxanthin currently the carotenoids with the greatest market preference display outstanding free radical scavenging ability and are now industrially produced on a large scale by the microalgae D. salina and H. pluvialis respectively Sun et al. 2023 . Lutein is another carotenoid that offers multiple health benefits and is produced in abundance from Chlorella Parachlorella Scenedesmus and Auxenochlorella Zheng et al. 2022 . Chlorophyll is the necessary pigment in most photosynthetic microalgal organism it is recommended as a by-product of multiproduct biorefinery and the chlorophyll- extracted biomass can be further used for pigment-free protein pro duction. Phycobiliproteins PBPs are the major light-harvesting element of cyanobacterial photosynthesis and are maturely developed as commercial colorants and functional health-food addictive Li et al. 2019 . Spirulina is the main source of commercial phycocyanin a PBP worth at least 250 USD kg 1 and is most likely to be commercialized in the near future. Other PBPs can be extracted from Spirulina Synecho coccus and Nostoc sp. Some microalgal species can be natural sources of vitamins phenols phytosterols and other bioactive substances that are usually present at small amounts. Some researchers optimistically believe that microalgae can perform better as natural sources of bioavailable vitamins than terrestrial plants this situation represents another promising direction for microalgal application in health-related industries Del Mondo et al. 2020 . The common vitamins and vitamin precursors obtained from microalgae include α- β- and γ-tocopherols ascorbic acid and ribo flavin. The production of microalgae-derived essential vitamins is Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 16 associated with the sources concentrations and availability of nitrogen during cultivation Bonnet et al. 2010 . Phytosterol which has multiple recognized health benefits has been widely used in the health industry. Although the investigation of microalgal phytosterols is still in its in fancy microalgal phytosterols are believed to possess great potential as a functional food supplement in accordance with previously reported information. Spirulina sp. was reported to produce clionasterol which aids cardiovascular disease prevention Barrow and Shahidi 2007 . Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites with clear biological activities and microalgae have been found to be rich in phenolic com pounds and considered as a promising natural source of these com pounds Del Mondo et al. 2021 Levasseur et al. 2020 . However current research on these substances is insufficient and the market de mand for these compounds is far less than that for mainstream bioactive substances. Nevertheless their natural production by microalgae is still regarded as a promising project worthy of investment. In summary the biological activities of the above high-value com pounds from microalgae have been explicitly confirmed and their future application as health-care products is positively expected. Nevertheless caution should be taken because the high biosafety and stability demanded of these bioproducts require precise and possibly energy- intensive production processes. On the other hand relevant regula tions and standards for health products derived from more microalgae strains need to be established and improved. 5.2.2. Agriculture Given that some microalgal refineries choose open culture systems and simple biomass harvesting methods to control production costs their products generally exhibit quality that is insufficient to meet market regulatory requirements for food or other health products despite their high nutrient contents. In this context these biomass products which are mostly in the form intact dried cells are often used as aquatic or animal feeds to transfer high-value nutrients indirectly to human bodies through the food chain. Chinese government actively encourages and supports the development of new plant-based feed proteins including microalgae. At present six kinds of algae and their processed products have been listed in China s feed raw materials cat alog including Schizochytrium Spirulina Nannochloropsis Chlorella Euglena and H. pluvialis. Microalgae are one of the important nutrient providers in the food chain of aquaculture animals and is decisive for the growth and external appearance of aquaculture animals Rizwan et al. 2018 . Microalgae especially Chlorella Tetraselmis Isochrysis Pavlova Phaeodactylum Nannochloropsis and Thalassiosira sp. are widely used as feeds or ad ditives for freshwater and marine aquatic animals Apt and Behrens 1999 Rizwan et al. 2018 . Brightly colored D. salina Spirulina and H. pluvialis are used as feed additives and natural pigments for culturing salmonid fish prawns and ornamental fish. Microalgae can also improve the breeding stability and immune systems of fish Pulz and Gross 2004 . Some zooplankton such as brine shrimp cladocerans and rotifers are farmed as the food sources of crustaceans and fish and microalgal biomass can also be utilized as fish and crustacean feed Borowitzka 1997 . Algologists have confirmed the capability of microalgae to be used as animal feed supplements. Poultry feed can be supplemented with 5 10 microalgae as a protein source. Worldwide 30 of current microalgal biomass products are used as animal feed or supplements Rizwan et al. 2018 . For example S. platensis and Chlorella pyrenoidosa as feed supplements for cows were found to significantly improve the rumen performance and microbial protein production Desmosdesmus sp. as a feed additive in chicken ration increased body weight and feed ef ficiency while decreasing feed intake Almomani et al. 2023 . Over 50 of cultured Arthrospira is used as feed for farmed animals ornamental birds and pets to support healthy development. Similar to crop biomass microalgal biomass can be converted into biochar via pyrolysis. In addition to being used as a carbon-negative bioenergy product biochar can be adopted as a high-quality bio fertilizer such an approach is also recognized as an ideal carbon sequestration solution Marris 2006 . As a biofertilizer source blue- green algae can improve crop yield and protein content provide nitro gen nutrient and thereby reduce fertilizer usage. Furthermore when used as soil conditioners microalgae improve soil physicochemical properties including pH electrical conductivity and residual soil ni trogen and carbon contents Rizwan et al. 2018 . The microalgal genera Aulosira Anabaena Nostoc and Tolypothrix are used for paddy crop farming because they fix atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms. Scientists believe that the techniques for microalgal feed and bio fertilizer production are sufficiently simple and adaptable to commercial-scale bulk production and that the agricultural market is suitable for generating additional income for microalgal carbon-fixing factories. 5.2.3. Bioplastics Algologists have discovered another application for microalgal biomass generated from carbon-fixing cultivation it can be used to produce biological materials instead of channeled into the food chain. Bioplastics the most common biomaterials can be synthesized from lipids protein or carbohydrates thus implying the application potential of microalgal organisms Laurens et al. 2017 . In the commercial-scale production of different bioplastics the microalgae Spirulina Nostoc Oscillatoria Synechocystis and Calothrix are recommended for poly hydroxyalkanoate PHA production while Chlorella sp. Scenedesmus sp. and Synechococcus sp. with considerable carbohydrate content are better for polylactic acid PLA production than other microalgal species Zhang et al. 2019 . The yield of these PHA and PLA products is often enhanced under nutrient-limiting culture conditions. For example Nostoc muscorum Agardh Nostocaceae was reported with a PHA pro duction yield of 69 under phosphate-limited conditions Bhati and Mallick 2015 . Recently genetic modification has also been proposed to induce bioplastic production. In a practical case the poly hydroxybutyrate yield of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 overexpressing native biosynthetic genes was 2.6-fold higher than that of the wild type 10 of DW Khetkorn et al. 2016 . When considering all the recent advances in microalgal applications one undoubtable perspective that can be found is that extracting valu able compounds from microalgal biomass is an attractive field in line with the concept of sustainable development. Its ecological and eco nomic profits have been increased to a degree that cannot be ignored in the microalgal carbon sequestration field and are attracting the interest of numerous scholars for further optimization and commercialization. 5.3. Microalgal refinery for environmental mitigation and remediation Another exigent contribution of microalgal refinery to the global ecological construction is the wastewater and flue gas purification ca pacity. In this process microalgae use residual organic compounds for growth and biomolecule synthesis. This situation not only decreases the cost demand of cultivation but also provides the possibility of a profit able atmospheric and water remediation approach. 5.3.1. Wastewater remediation systems Municipal agricultural livestock rearing and industrial wastewa ters are enriched with a variety of nutrient components and have been demonstrated to be nontoxic and safe substrates for microalgal biomass production Ahmad et al. 2017 . Microalgal wastewater purification is based on three different mechanisms biosorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation. Living or dead algal cells can biosorb contaminants which often are often present in wastewater enriched with heavy metals or pharmaceuticals Hena et al. 2021 . The former usually employs strains of Chlamydo monas Chlorella Scenedesmus Nannochloropsis and Parachlorella whereas the latter involves Scenedesmus Chlorella Chlamydomonas and Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 17 Mychonastes sp. Bhatt et al. 2022 Hena et al. 2021 Spain et al. 2021 . The bioaccumulation of microalgal cells is mainly used to remove heavy metals pesticides phosphates and nitrates from wastewaters and is particularly suitable for decreasing agricultural pollutant load. The accumulated compounds are later retained or metabolized by cells Mustafa et al. 2021 . Microalgae can remove toxic organic pollutants by degrading them into simple non-noxious substances. The related technology involving Chlorella Scenedesmus Aphanocapsa Chlamydo monas and Nannochloropsis species has been adopted in the treatment of oil wastes pyrene phenol and lindane in wastewaters from petroleum refineries and heavy industries Touliabah et al. 2022 . Algal strain selection should be contingent on the wastewater source. Generally indigenous microalgae screened from original wastewater often display great pollutant removal capability and environmental adaptability Jeong and Jang 2020 . Several strains of Chlorella Acu todesmus and Desmodesmus sp. have been cultured in municipal waste water and demonstrated successful nitrogen and phosphorous removal along with lipid-rich biomass production Lage et al. 2021 Purba et al. 2022 Zhao et al. 2018 . For example Chlorella sp. could remove total phosphorus total nitrogen and ammonia in wastewater by 80.9 89.1 and 93.9 respectively Almomani et al. 2023 . Furthermore mixing categories of municipal wastewater is recom mended to balance nutrient concentrations and ratios You et al. 2022 . Wastewaters from agricultural applications especially livestock rearing contain fertilizers residual feeds and feces providing abundant pro teins fats nitrogen ammonia potassium and phosphorous for feasible microalgal growth Zhao et al. 2022 . A previous study used wastewater from a palm oil mill as the medium for Chlorella growth and reported a reduction of 80.9 in nitrogen content and efficient CO2 capture Hariz et al. 2018 . In another case C. vulgaris was cultured in poultry wastewater wherein lipid-rich biomass was produced along with the removal of 95 of the chemical oxygen demand COD Guti errez- Casiano et al. 2022 . In the industry microalgae have been applied to treat textile pharmaceutical petroleum refinery and food manufacturing effluents. C. vulgaris successfully removed 76.23 of the COD of textile wastewater and simultaneously solved the problem of intractable decolorization e.g. 98 removal of methylene blue Fazal et al. 2021 . Petroleum refinery effluent usually contains a variety of metals and organic compounds and has been remediated through the biomass accumulation of Scenedesmus and Spongiochloris species Chen et al. 2021 . Dairy wastewater which contains lactose proteins and lipids has been commonly employed for microalgal cultivation mainly involving strains of Chlorella Scenedesmus Acutodesmus Chloromonas and Desmodesmus Costa et al. 2021 Goveas et al. 2022 Kusmayadi et al. 2022 . As highlighted by algologists microalgal-mediated wastewater treatment deserves vigorous promotion because it represents an important approach for executing the principles of circular bioeconomy while synchronously saving the operating cost of microalgal cultivation. However this technology requires the comprehensive consideration of microalgal remediation efficiency and the potential harmful factors for microalgal growth. Moreover the complex effects of the micro alga bacterium symbiotic system cannot be ignored. 5.3.2. Flue gas circulation system Similar to wastewater treatment microalgal refineries can also be supplied by CO2-rich flue gases to achieve the dual purpose of cultiva tion cost reduction and cyclic carbon source utilization. Flue gas is emanated by industrial combustion facilities. It contains combustion products and residual substances with numerous adverse effects on human health. The efficient and harmless treatment of flue gases is eagerly desired as a component of national environmental protection programs. Over the past few years microalgal refineries with flue gas aeration have been actively introduced into bioenergy industries all over the world. For example a company in Israel has used microalgal refineries to culture the phototrophic microalgal species of Phaeodactylum Duna liella Chlorococcum Tetraselmis and Nannochloris for bioethanol bio diesel and omega-3 FA production Gotovtsev et al. 2019 . Many studies have confirmed that the presence of SOx and NOx from unfil tered coal-fired flue gas might exert negative effects on cell growth previously attributed to the decrease in pH Rawat et al. 2013 . Thus appropriate treatments before aeration into the medium are necessary. Carbon sequestered from industrial flue gas can be converted in the sustainable production of biodiesel because lipid-rich microalgal biomass can be harvested from this system and processed into high- quality biodiesel Aslam et al. 2018 . Biogas also contains high concentrations of CO2 which impose a cost burden on transportation and compression and counter the carbon- negative emission aim of this bioenergy technology Kao et al. 2012 . A study used Chlorella to capture the CO2 in biogas produced through the anaerobic digestion of pig effluents and observed the capacity of Chlorella to capture and use CO2 for biomass accumulation. This process elevated CH4 concentration by 10 and yielded biogas with upgraded quality Li et al. 2022a . Other studies also verified the feasibility of biodiesel production from microalgal biogas fixation. A zero-emission process system established on this premise boosted CH4 content and upgraded biogas and oil production Tongprawhan et al. 2014 . In short flue gas aeration in microalgal cultivation is encouraged to guide microalgal resource management and mitigate anthropogenic atmospheric contamination. On the basis of the sustainable develop ment concept scholars are now devoted to achieving zero emissions with flue gas fixation and wastewater treatment as the starting points and microalgal refineries are believed to be competent profitable sus tainable and ecofriendly technologies for the CO2 biomass bioresource cycle. 6. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis Microalgal biorefining is a futuristic approach consistent with the world s net-zero emission principle. When facing its promising applica tion prospect the public attention has been inevitably attracted by the progression of its commercial feasibility. The techno-economic assess ment TEA and life cycle assessment LCA are widely used as foun dation approaches for assessing the economic and environmental impacts of microalgal biorefineries and generating the alternative pro cessing technologies to achieve commercial viability. 6.1. Life cycle assessment Environmental impact assessment of the microalgal biorefineries is a considerable indicator to evaluate whether they are in compliance with sustainable development goals and can provide cost minimization guidance for industries. LCA is a comprehensive assessing tool of the potential impacts to the overall environmental load throughout the life cycle of microalgal biorefineries i.e. from algae cultivation via dew atering extraction conversion production of bioproducts to waste disposal and recycle Mu et al. 2020 . The outstanding environmental friendliness of microalgae biorefining is reflected in the comparison with the productive process of conventional diesel and chemical products. Bennion et al. 2015 obtained a LCA model using GREET Model 2013 and investigated the NER and GHG emission of microalgal bioenergy production through hydrothermal liquefaction were respectively 1.23 MJ MJ and 11.4 g CO2-eq. MJ 1 while the bioenergy production via pyrolysis obtained NER 2.27 MJ MJ and 210 g CO2-eq. MJ 1 GHG emission. On the contrary in another case Spirulina and Chlorella pro duce worse environmental impacts compared to traditional food feed protein sources due to high energy consumption in culture and down stream processing but the current conclusion is believed to be over turned with the advancement of technology Smetana et al. 2017 . In addition microalgal biorefineries show low impacts for eutrophication and land use which is explained by the high biomass yield and usage of Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 18 wastelands. Also these biorefineries has less impacted soil acidification and human toxicity owing to the lack of fertilizer and pesticides usage Banu et al. 2020 . Making full use of resources and simplifying the production process particularly the PBRs energy consumption are the crucial segments to realizing economic feasibility. A LCA study conducted by Porcelli et al. 2020 systematically evaluated the environmental impacts of PBRs infrastructure microalgae cultivation flocculation filtration and biomass drying the result revealed that cultivation in PBRs had poten tial to reduce environmental impacts but still exists obstacles like high costs on artificial illumination and CO2 aeration. These obstacles are believed to be solved by integrating wastewater and flue gas. When microalgae utilize costless CO2 and nutrients this process also contrib utes to greatly relief environmental burden of flue gas decarbonization and water remediation. A LCA of bioreactor for algal biodiesel produc tion detected the obvious reduction in environmental impacts with minimum GHG footprint with wastewater usage for cultivation and transesterification via biocatalyst Saranya and Ramachandra 2020 . In summary microalgal biorefinery has a positive effect on reducing GHG emission energy economy and environmental remediation but its environmental impact is not entirely positive at this stage. Furthermore the LCA of the overall cycle is also sensitive to availability of renewable sources and the demand for final products. Further analyses are required to be conducted on the strain characteristics steady state production and climate suitability to thoroughly evaluate the LCA. 6.2. Techno-economic analysis TEA creates comprehensive analysis of direct connection between economic and technical aspects of microalgal biorefinery via investi gating the operational costs the risks in every processing phase and the economic practicability of downstream bioproducts Mu et al. 2020 . For microalgae biorefining the most vital aspect of economic impact analysis is the expense of processes and devices employed. The choice of cultivation structure determines the economics of microalgae biorefining to a large extent and the commercial viability of biorefinery systems in open ponds OPs flat panel PBRs vertical PBRs and horizontal PBRs have been analyzed. Comparatively OPs consist of simpler construction and operations leading to 2 10 times lower capital and operation costs compared to PBRs attributing to lower installation and process maintenance costs Chia et al. 2018 . However PBRs have greater advantage in terms of light illuminating efficiency nutrient uptake efficiency culture density biomass productivity and controlla bility. At the current stage developing the easy-to-operate PBRs with simple structure and practical functions is still the key objective. Different PBR type scale and design parameters lead to significantly diverse cost ranging 2.82 30.97 USD kg 1 Khetkorn et al. 2017 . The flat-plate reactor is a classical and relatively inexpensive option for microalgae cultivation but it may require more maintenance cost. The tubular reactor is considered as the most expensive approach and is typically implemented on a pilot scale Ting et al. 2017 . The economic feasibility of microalgae cultivation is greatly influenced by the selection of substrate. For instance the cost of using acrylic-based tubes is twice as high as that of using glass. In biofilm PBRs different substrate materials are available and PVC sheeting is often preferred due to its durability and affordability. The membrane photobioreactor MPBR is widely recognized as a highly promising technology for microalgae cultivation and harvesting Xu et al. 2014 . It has been found that microalgae cultivated in MPBRs exhibit higher biomass productivity compared to other types of photo bioreactors Gao et al. 2021 . In addition the operation and mainte nance costs associated with MPBRs are significantly lower than those of traditional PBRs Sheng et al. 2017 . While MPBRs offer numerous advantages their scale in terms of submerged membrane modules has not yet reached the requirements of industrial standards. Hybrid PBR systems which combine elements from traditional cultivation systems have shown great potential in achieving higher operational efficiency and productivity at a lower cost and energy consumption Singh and Sharma 2012 . Several studies using a LCA approach have also demonstrated that hybrid PBR systems can help mitigate environmental impacts and reduce expenses associated with microalgae cultivation in wastewater Kohlheb et al. 2020 . Since PERs are generally coordinated with artificial light source the effective regulation of light illumination is a positive way of cost reduction. Unsuitable illumination leads to cellular inadaptability and decreasing CO2 fixation and also causes massive energy loss due to energy dissipation. Maroneze et al. 2016 revealed that a suitable photoperiod with light dark cycle of 0.5 0.5 s can reduce 33 reduction of electric energy demand for per unit production period. While CO2 can be saw as free resource the supply of other nutrients still accounts for 1 10 of total microalgal biorefining cost. As mentioned for many times nutrients utilization from waste resources is one of the most viable approaches to decrease economic cost. The usage of food feed waste landfill leachate agricultural wastewater and in dustrial flue gas as nutrients source instead of commercial nutrients can well reduce economic burden of microalgae cultivation. Sun et al. 2022 investigated the economic impact of wastes as a medium on microalgae production by employing TEA and indicated that culturing microalgae in wastes could significantly reduce the total production expenditure. Judd et al. 2017 suggested that 36 95 of microalgae lipids production cost could be reduced by using waste resource as nu trients source and using flue gas as CO2 source. Simultaneous synthesis of value-added products is the most cost- effective and feasible method to decrease manufacturing cost and offer possibilities for commercial feasibility of microalgae biorefineries. To achieve this goal it seems easy to think of genetic engineering and synthetic biology strategies for undergone significant development to improve value-added products output. However such methods did not always work. A techno-economic evaluation of biodiesel production from genetically engineered Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 showed that lipids productivity enhancement as sole regulating target was not able to valorize overall biodiesel investment since the cumbersome and cost- intensive downstream biodiesel transesterification greatly elevated its cost Lopes et al. 2019 . Instead it is more essential to seek for the most suitable and complete utilization of biomass products for each bio refining industry in which the composite exploitation of cellular com pounds is encouraged to maximize the economic benefit and minimize the cost of by-product treatments. For example Algal biodiesel pro duction can become economical sustainable by producing biodiesel from lipid and synthesizing bioethanol enzymatically from the remaining de- oiled biomass Kouzuma and Watanabe 2015 . In the situation of an urgent global environmental and energy crisis the process of reducing carbon emissions has already started. Microalgal biorefineries carry the burden of achieving both high commercial output and high environmental returns which of course cannot be satisfied perfectly in the short term. By adhering to a carbon neutral label microalgal biorefineries can benefit from an enhanced image that gives them a competitive edge. The question at hand is whether it is worth to chase for carbon net-zero emission and also how much does it cost to achieve this goal. Numerous researches and analyses have clarified that although the commercial returns are not satisfactory at this stage welcoming novel microalgal biorefinery is a great step in the right di rection as prioritizing environmental sustainability outweighs the cost of doing nothing. 7. Challenges and future perspectives While the theoretical feasibility of the action of microalgae in carbon sequestration has been proven in detail the lack of a biosequestration technology that simultaneously satisfies the efficiency and economy of large-scale sequestration is the major developmental obstacle to commercialization. Y. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 901 2023 165546 19 The bioaccessibility of CO2 the major removal target directly affects the fixation efficiency to a large degree. The proportion of CO2 aeration demands precise regulation instead of blind increases because excess aeration would cause cell vitality exhaustion and unnecessary energy costs. Biotechnologies particularly advanced genetic tools that enhance the carbon uptake capacity of microalgal strains are enthusiastically promoted. Although many microalgal strains have been bred with great CO2 tolerance and uptake capacity only a minority of these strains display stable phenotypes between multiple generations. On the basis of previous experience future studies could explore this issue further by genetically strengthening the activity of the carbon sequestration pathway. Establishing additional pathways in certain species with considerable receptiveness can also be another option. After all the construction of these biological approaches imposes increased re quirements for the in-depth investigation of algal CCM systems and the employed functional structures. Improper illumination results in undesirable effects on cellular car bon conversion. In the absence of accurately designed PBR devices adverse light transfer and uneven light distribution in the medium might cause a reduction in superficial cell growth due to photo-oxidation damage and downregulate the CO2 fixation rate of cells in light- deficient interior areas. On the other hand light transfer efficiency can be considered to be another major challenge. Although the amendment of the light-harvesting photosynthetic apparatus has been proposed recently the photosynthetic efficiency of improved strains in large-scale cultivation has not been verified. Nevertheless related ge netic engineering in this field may constitute the object of future studies. Although improvement engineering for new strain generation has promising prospects its possible threats to the ecosystem and human health make it controversial. From a practical perspective the improvement in cultivation processes may equally promote the microalga-based carbon sequestration industry by focusing on rein forcing economic feasibility and market competitiveness. The current research in this field mainly focuses on the design and improvement of PBRs and aerator installations which are tightly associated with CO2 and light supply for microalgal carbon sequestration. From this stand point the adoption of closed PBRs instead of open ponds is the pre vailing trend and multiple optical engineering techniques have been developed to optimize the uniformity of illumination and CO2 distri bution in culture systems. Previous experience illustrates that light transfer uniformity CO2 bubble diameter and retention time are the direct elements for assessing the quality of PBR installations and are the controllable factors for improving carbon fixation efficiency. However most of the present PBRs have a common defect Their complex internal structure leads to heavy operating costs and energy consumption thus hindering the implementation of bioeconomic principles. As a conse quence additional theoretical and practical works are needed to support the design of simple and effective PBR devices. In response to the policy of the circular carbon economy the biomass products of microalgal carbon fixation refineries are expected to bring profits in the form of sustainable biological resources. Although micro algal bioproducts have considerable potential for catering to the demand of a variety of markets they involve undesirable energy-intensive downstream processes. In consideration of the high biosafety and sta bility demands for some bioactive products cultivation should be per formed under strictly controlled conditions. Moreover the optional approaches for downstream processing are limited. All these issues un doubtedly lead to increased cost and energy consumption and are sug gestive of a sorely urgent demand for further advancement in related sciences technologies engineering and product processing. The coupling of contaminant treatment with microalgal refineries is another topic for future research. The cultivation of microalgae in wastewater medium or under flue gas aeration has already been realized on a large scale and is worthy of further exploration particularly in terms of downstream bioenergy output. Approaches to the pretreatment of contaminants require deep investigation to guarantee optimal conditions for algal growth and carbon sequestration. The implementation of Internet of Things IoT and artificial intel ligence AI technology in other agriculture and industries has stimu lated the intelligence of microalgae biorefinery. Precise monitoring controlling and predicting of microalgae growth can achieve the control and promotion of their carbon sequestration process and improvement of bioproduct quality clearer than ever before. Particularly the involved essential parameters in microalgae biorefinery require precise moni toring to ensure effective carbon sequestration and biomass productiv ity. Yan et al. 2021 developed an operational microalgae growth forecasting system equipped with an ensemble data assimilation that could improve the 7-day forecasting skill by 85 . The accuracy of this and similar forecasting systems could inform real-time operational de cisions such as pond operation and harvest planning for commercial- scale production. However the intelligence of this biorefinery is still in the infancy phase for the commercial microalgae farming has yet to maturely incorporate with IoT and AI technology the application of these approaches is necessary and worthwhile to be further studied. To summarize microalgal carbon sequestration is an incipient technology facing multifaceted obstacles to its development. Further academic research and practical exploration are certainly required to overcome its bottlenecks. We confidently believe that the environ mental economic and social benefits brought by this technology will far exceed the initial investments. 8. Conclusions In the long run microalgal biorefining is a feasible and profitable solution of GHG emission and environmental crisis and its commercial application has also attracted extensive attention of economists. Previ ous works have reported the excellent carbon fixation capacity of microalgae and the underlying mechanism of CCM systems and carbon fixation pathways in various algal species has also been largely discov ered. As highlighted in this article multiple biological technologies especially genetic engineering can be adopted for further strain improvement to improve fixation efficiency of biorefineries. Cultivation processes also require regulation for optimized conditions that match algal carbon sequestration properties and meanwhile suppress the running cost. Microalgal refineries exhibit outstanding contributions as the biopump enforcing zero-carbon circular bioeconomy because their output algal biomass can be circulated as a valuable bioresource in a variety of markets. This sustainable bioresource helps partially alleviate the energy crisis and create remarkable economic income. The advancement of innovative technologies using CO2 and nutrients from waste resources is strongly recommended to take a great step toward final commercialization of microalgal biorefineries. Guided by the principles of sustainable development the ecological and economic impacts are not ignorable in every single segment. On guarantee of remarkable practical contribution on net-zero emission goal more ef forts should be made to promote the formation of energy-efficient pro cessing strategies and meanwhile a benign bioeconomy loop of biorefineries.

Wang et al.', 'Sustainable microalgal biomass production in food industry wastewater for low-cost bioreﬁnery products a review Sabeela Beevi Ummalyma . Ranjna Sirohi . Aswathy Udayan . Pooja Yadav . Abhay Raj . Sang Jun Sim . Ashok Pandey Received 30 October 2021 Accepted 24 February 2022 The Author s under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022 Abstract Microalgae are recognized as cell factories enriched with biochemicals suitable as feedstock for bio-energy food feed pharmaceuticals and nutraceu- ticals applications. The industrial application of microalgae is challenging due to hurdles associated with mass cultivation and biomass recovery. The scale- up production of microalgal biomass in freshwater is not a sustainable solution due to the projected increase of freshwater demands in the coming years. Microalgae cultivation in wastewater is encouraged in recent years forsustainable bioeconomy from bioreﬁnery processes. Wastewater from the food industry is a less-toxic growth medium for microalgal biomass production. Traditional wastewater treatment and management processes are expensive hence it is highly relevant to use low-cost wastewater treatment processes with revenue generation through different products. Microalgae are accepted as potential biocatalysts for the bioremediation of wastewater. Microalgae based puriﬁcation of wastewater technology could be a universal alternative solution for the recovery of resources from wastewater for low-cost biomass feed- stock for industry. This review highlights the impor- tance of microalgal biomass production in food processing wastewater their characteristics and dif- ferent microalgal cultivation methods followed by nutrient absorption mechanisms. Towards the end of the review different microalgae biomass harvesting processes with bioreﬁnery products and void gaps that Sabeela Beevi Ummalyma Ranjna Sirohi have contributed equally and share co-ﬁrst authors.

Escalating popu- lation and widening industrialization utilizes a large amount of freshwater for different purposes and generates a huge volume of wastewater. The release of untreated wastewater into the environment creates a severe danger to the ecosystem Ummalyma et al. 2021 . Qadir et al. 2020 showed that presently approx. 380 trillion L y of wastewater is produced throughout the world and Asian counties are the leading producer of wastewater 159trillion L y followed by Europe and North America. A report from UNESCO United Nations 2017 showed that approx. 80 of the untreated wastewater is released into the water bodies. A study showed that developed and developing countries treat 70 of wastewater 123 Phytochem Rev whereas medium-income countries 38 treatment and appro.8 in low-income countries. Meanwhile 40 of the world will face a freshwater crisis in 2030 which will be a serious social and economic challenge in the coming years Sun et al. 2016 Sato et al. 2013 . Among different food processing industry generates huge amounts of waste and wastewater. According to the report of Boland et al. 2013 Food and Agricul- tural Organization showed that from 2000 2050 milk and meal production would increase globally by 82 and 100 respectively. Reports highlighted that beer production in many of the top countries reached 199 million kiloliters. For one liter of beer production approx. 4.5L of water is consumed Arantes et al. 2017 . Food processing is the crucial part of food supply chains and its water footprint is greater considerations for signiﬁcant water usage in manufacturing and a huge volume of wastewater Menese et al. 2017 . Food processing wastewaters are organic and it enhances the growth of microorganisms and causes eutrophica- tion of freshwater bodies if discharged without treatment. This wastewater does not contain toxic metals such as heavy metals and is non-toxic com- pared with other industrial efﬂuents Ghimpusan et al. 2017 . Treatment for nutrients and pollutants removal from food processing wastewater can be performed by a physical and chemical process. The drawback of the traditional method is the usage of strong chemicals secondary pollution to the atmosphere the high operating costs could reduce the efﬁciency during commercial applications Li et al. 2019 . To overcome these existing challenges there is an increasing attraction towards biological green processes for wastewater treatments and pollutants remediation all over the world. To deal with the emerging concerns about environment and biodiversity preservation there are stringent regulations on safe discharge which has directed the need for alternative innovative and sustainable processes for waste mitigation Hus- sain et al. 2021 Ummalyma et al. 2021 Singh et al. 2020 Zhuang et al. 2020 Saravanan et al. 2018 Sharma et al. 2021 . In this regard the biological wastewater treatment option based on the microalgae- based process offers potential promises Sirohi et al. 2021a 2021b Yu et al. 2021 Joun et al. 2021 . Microalgae are attractive biocatalysts to meet the wastewater treatment process and energy crisis. Microalgae can grow faster remove nutrients and treat wastewater simultaneously produce biomass suitable for biofuels and bioreﬁnery products Umma- lyma et al. 2021 Hussain et al. 2021 . Microalgae can able to grow different trophic modes of nutrition. Photoautotrophic algae trap CO2 and sunlight from the atmosphere for energy and carbon for their growth and reproduction meantime helping in the mitigation of CO2 and valuable products. Heterotrophic microalgae take organic nutrients for carbon and energy sources from the wastewater and produce biomass for biore- ﬁneries whereas mixotrophic microalgae can grow by trapping CO2 and organic carbon available from the wastewater as energy and carbon source for their multiplication and produce biomass for different applications Hussain et al. 2021 Ummalyma et al. 2021 . Several kinds of research have been performed for the puriﬁcation of wastewater using different microalgal species. A recent report highlighted that microalgae have the potential for effective removal of high concentrations of organic carbon phosphorous and nitrogen from food processing wastewater and produced different value-added products polysaccha- rides biofuels pigments and amino acids Nur and Buma 2019 Ummalyma et al. 2021 . In this present review discussing the importance of food processing wastewater as a nutrient medium for low-cost biomass for circular bioeconomy bioreﬁnery products and characterization of various food processing wastewa- ters are highlighted. Following different bioreactors used for microalgae cultivations are detailed with mechanisms of nutrient absorption. In the end harvesting processes of microalgal biomass possible bioreﬁnery products derived from wastewater-grown microalgae are ascribed and void gaps in this ﬁeld for future research outlook are discussed. Different sources of food industrial efﬂuents and their composition Food processing wastewaters FPWWs are generated mainly from dairy processing meat processing edible oil processing starch and brewery processing units. FPWWs are characterized by high organic contents in the form of total dissolved solids TDSs total suspended solids TSSs biological oxygen demand BOD and Chemical oxygen demand COD oils fats and grease. The composition and contamination loads of the FPWWs depend on the type of industry 123 Phytochem Rev raw materials and processing technologies Amin et al. 2021 Subha et al. 2020 Li et al. 2019 . It is non toxic due to traces of chemicals such as antibiotics and heavy metals however microalgae biomass produc- tion in FPWWs is suitable for high-value chemicals such as proteins polymers pigments polysaccha- rides and DHA Gecim et al. 2021 Humaidah et al. 2020 . The difference in nutrient composition of FPWWs also inﬂuences microalgae growth and bio- chemicals. Different types of FPWWs and their compositions are described in the ﬂowing section. Starch processing wastewater Starch processing wastewater SPWW is a typical waste stream from FPWW which is rich in nutrients is non-toxic and an ideal medium for microalgal biomass production. The starch processing industry consumes a huge volume of water and hence produces 6 10m3 of wastewater per ton of starch processing. SPWW discharged from the starch processing industry are characterized by high organic nutrients in the form of COD 6000 30 000 mg L with a high amount of dissolved organic matter Tan et al.2019 Wang et al. 2017 . Cassava is the important staple food crop in the world its processing generates 600L of wastewater to treat per ton of root. This wastewater is rich in high starch with BOD COD and ammonium nitrogen content with total dissolved solids with cyanoglyco- sides de Carvalho et al. 2018 . In addition to this it contains high potassium salts protein organic acids minerals dissolved starch oils and fats. These components act as essential nutrients that support microalgal biomass production Li et al. 2020 . Meat processing wastewater Meat processing wastewater MPWW characteristics are depending on the factors such as the size of the processing unit type of animal processing the volume of water consumed per animal and the washing process. Meat production reached approx.330million tons in the case of bovine pig and poultry. The leading meat processing countries are Russia United States Brazil Mexico and India Food and Agricul- tural Organization 2018 . Escalating demands for meat products the amount of MPWW generated through slaughter washing and packing process. Wastewater produced as a result of meat processing units are enriched with a high quantity of nutrients in the form of organic matter volatile fatty acids VFA detergents pathogens antibiotics and heavy metals intense coloration and odor Bethi et al. 2020 Aziz et al. 2019 .MPWW has high concentrations of total organic carbon total nitrogen phosphorus and these nutrients are essential macronutrients required for microalgae growth and biomass production. Aziz et al. 2019 reported that meat and slaughterhouse wastew- ater has 1100 15 000 mg L of COD 600-3900 mg L of BOD 50-800 mg L TN 20-300 mg L ammonia 15-200 mg L TP 220 6400 mg L of TSS 350-1340 mg L alkalinity 175-797 mg LVFA 40 1385 mg L of oil and grease respectively. A recent report showed that the cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris in acid precipitated poultry slaughterhouse wastewater removed 83 COD in batch mode. The maximum biomass produced from this method of cultivation was 1.2 g L Hilares et al. 2021 . Phyco- erythrin was puriﬁed from the biomass of Porphyrium cruentium cultivated from the MPWW highlighted that this medium is suitable for obtaining bioproducts from microalgae Balaraman et al. 2021 . Dairy wastewater Dairy processing is one of the key sources of wastewater generated all over the world. The dairy processing factories convert raw milk to condensed milk pasteurized milk produce products such as creams whey cheese butter yogurt etc. The gener- ated wastewater mainly consists of milk product residues by-product of unit operations and wastewater generated by cleaning of milk equipment washing of containers quality control and laboratory analysis. Every liter of milk processing approximately 0.2 to 10L of wastewater discharged Li et al. 2019 Umma- lyma et al. 2014 . Wastewater quality and character- istics may ﬂuctuate subject to the type of processing methods adopted ﬁnal products and size of the factory Zkeri et al. 2021 . There are two different types of wastewater is generated from this industry high-strength concentrated wastewater originated from cheese whey and milk permeate characterized by the high amount of COD 100 g l due to the high content of organic matter fats and lactose. The medium-strength dairy wastewater does not contain COD higher than 5 g L Zkeri et al. 2021 . In general dairy wastewater is characterized by high COD 123 Phytochem Rev BOD and volatile solids. Major components present in this wastewater are soluble milk proteins lactose lipids fatty acids minerals salts and detergents content nitrogen and phosphorous. Hence this wastewater is rich in carbon nitrogen and phospho- rous and it could be an excellent nutrient medium for microalgae biomass production for low-cost bioreﬁn- ery products Sawin et al. 2020 Li et al. 2019 . Winery and brewery wastewater Winery wastewater WWW is produced as a result of different process activities such as washing during grape harvesting pressing fermentation process bottling and ﬁltrations. It has been reported that 0.5- 14L of wastewaters are generated for 1L of wine production. WWW is organic due to the sugars organic acids polyphenols esters aldehydes soaps and other detergents with low pH Senapathi et al. 2020 . The brewery waste industry produces a huge volume of wastewater during the brewing process. It has been reported that 4-8m3 of wastewater is produced per m3 of beer production Kebede2018 . Reports showed that this wastewater has high organic loads 2000 6000 mg L in the form of COD with total nitrogen 25 80 mg L and phosphorous 10 15 mg L . Brewery wastewater BWW is the suitable nutrient medium for microorganisms due to less heavy metals content and provides optimum growth conditions with neutral pH Amenorfenyo et al. 2019 Farook et al. 2013 . BWW contains sugars volatile fatty acids soluble starch alcohols and celluloses. BWW pH levels are variable depending on the concentrations and type of chemicals cleaning and sanitizing purpose Amenorfenyo et al. 2019 . Recently this wastewater is given attraction as a growth medium for microalgae biomass production for biomolecule recovery. Co-cultivation of Scene- desmus sp. and Chlorella sorokiniana in BWW showed that 78 organic pollutant removal with 90 97 removal of ammonia total nitrogen and phosphorous. Produced biomass recovered 16 mg l of chlorophyll 9.57 mg L of carotenoids and 30.4 mg L of carbohydrates respectively Han et al. 2021 . Song et al. 2020 reported that the cultivation of Chlorella sp. Spirulina and Scenedesmus sp. in the BWW prove that Scenedesmus sp. are fast-growing and adapted organisms in BWW with 1.02 g L of biomass production with nutrients removal of COD 73 ammonia 89 total nitrogen 75 and phospho- rous 95 respectively. Oil mill wastewater Oil mill efﬂuents are mainly originated from the processing of olive oil and palm oil. Palm oils mill is mainly found in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand Malaysia Nigeria and Columbia. The blooming of oil mill agribusiness generates enormous waste and efﬂuents. Releasing of Palm oil mill efﬂuents POME are tenfold higher than crude palm oil Cheng et al. 2020 . During the production of palm oil approx.1.5m3freshwater is required for the pro- cessing of one-ton fresh palm fruit bunches and concurrently generate 0.75 m3 of POME. POME is unpleasant greasy brownish organic liquor with high chemical and biological oxygen demands. POME is a dark brown viscous liquid consisting of 95 96 wt of water total solids of 4 5 TSS of 2 4 and high turbidity of 65 590-69410NIU Cheng et al. 2020 . The olive oil industry is active in European country mainly Serbia France Turkey and Mediterranean Basin. Huge voluminous freshwater is used in the olive mill industry and ﬁnally discharged in the form of olive mill efﬂuents OME . Oil mill efﬂuents are characterized by complex substrates composed of amino acids inorganic nutrients such as calcium magnesium potassium sodium organic acids and carbohydrates such as simple sugars and hemicellu- loses Li et al. 2019 . Further characterization of POME showed that BOD and COD range from 15 000 to 30 000 mg L and 40 000 90 000 mg L respec- tively. TSS in the range of 20 000 40 000 mg L TDS between 15 30 000 mg L VSS in the range of 15 35 000 mg L respectively Nur and Buma2019 . Microalgae species are used for the phytoremediation of pollutants present in this wastewater and produce low-cost biomass for bioreﬁnery products. Microalgae such as Chromochloris zoﬁngiensis and Haematococ- cus pluvialis were exploited to produce high-value molecules such as carotenoids and astaxanthin from biomass produced through the cultivation in POME Fernando et al. 2021 . Microalgae such as Coelas- trella sp. Chlamydomonas sp. and Scenedesmus sp. were cultivated in POME showed 80 of pollutants removal by using raw and sterilized efﬂuents 123 Phytochem Rev Udaiyappan et al. 2020 . Phycoremediation and CO2 ﬁxation from POME was studied with three microal- gae species Chlorella sorokiniana UKM2 Chlorella pyrenoidosa UKM7 and Coelastralla. The result showed that these microalgae can be able to remove inorganic nutrients up to 100 . Two Chlorella sp. were cultivated in pretreated POME for biomass production lipid content and pollutants remediation. Results showed that 2.2 g L of biomass with 11.2 lipid and 62 nitrogen removal 47 COD reduction and 30.7 total phosphorous reductions Cheah et al. 2018 . Table 1 represents different microalgae strains utilized for cultivation in food industrial wastewater for bioreﬁnery products. Bioreﬁnery of food industry wastewater for production of value-added products Low-cost microalgal biomass production for bioreﬁn- ery products in food industrial wastewater is advan- tageous due to low toxicity in nature. Mass production of microalgae biomass in wastewater is possible for biomolecule extractions for different applications due to the absorption of the different organic and inorganic nutrients present in the wastewater streams that assist fast growth and biomass production Ummalyma et al. 2021 . A challenging issue in microalgae biomass production in the wastewater stream is the harvesting of biomass from the growth medium and biomolecules extractions. Selection of cultivation system for mass production of biomass is depending on the character- istics of wastewaters type of microalgae chosen and ﬁnal applications. A suitable culture system should be easy to handle low cost of construction provision for adequate light supply be capable of effective transfers of liquid and gas no risk for contaminations Tan et al. 2020 . Cultivation methods Microalgae have the evolutionary capability to adapt to the harsh environment rapid growth and high photosynthetic capacity along with the accumulation of bioproducts within their cells makes them suit- able industrial feedstock. Microalgae large-scale cul- tivation does not require fertile land freshwater pesticides and herbicide compared to its terrestrial counterpart. Many reports are highlighted that microalgal biomass is successfully produced from different wastewater resources Ummalyma et al. 2021 Fernando et al. 2021 Singh et al. 2020 Tan et al. 2020 Li et al. 2019 . At the research level microalgae produce biomass with a high growth rate in laboratory conditions but when it comes to large-scale production still more challenge is there to recover high biomass productivity. Microalgae cultivation methods are generally categorized into the open pond photo- bioreactor and hybrid cultivation systems. The selec- tion of cultivation methods is further reliant on the growth mode of microalgae such as phototrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic nature. Open cultivation systems An open cultivation system is preferred for the large- scale cultivation of microalgae for low-cost bioreﬁn- ery products. The open cultivation system is perhaps the oldest and most simple experimental setup to grow microalgae most frequently used in outdoor condi- tions using sunlight. This cultivation has usually given importance in the industrial-scale production of biomass mainly due to simple operation ease of construction and low energy requirements Bhatia et al. 2021 . There are several open cultivation systems are utilized for microalgal biomass production such as natural ponds lakes specially designed reactors such as raceways and circular ponds. The circular pond is the ﬁrst artiﬁcially fabricated having a depth of 30 to 70 cm and a depth of 45 m with a rotating agitator for mixing and preventing biomass sedimentations. This system is larger and causes water resistance which leads to mechanical stress on the agitations. The design of this pond is limited by its bigger size high construction cost and energy requirement for the agitation process Tan et al. 2020 . A raceway reactor consists of a series of closed-loop channels 30 cm deep and is ﬁtted with a paddle wheel to avoid sedimentations and enable recirculation of microalgae culture broth for proper nutrients and CO2 supply to enhance the growth rate and biomass production Bhatia et al. 2021 . Outdoor open raceways were used for the commercial of production cyanobacteria and microalgae biomass. Raceways are the best open pond cultivation design available mainly due to energy efﬁciency and a single paddlewheel is sufﬁcient for proper agitations of a 5-hectare raceway pond Rogers et al. 2014 . The beneﬁts of open systems were easy to 123 Phytochem Rev maintain and cost-efﬁcient due to using solar energy as primary energy input.A circular open pond system is used in Taiwan and Japan for cultivating Chlorella sp. Shen et al. 2009 . Sapphire Energy Columbus an algal biomass farm located in the United States successfully utilized a raceway pond for the production of 520 metric tons of dry microalgae biomass for continuously 2 years of operation without any technical problems White and Ryan 2015 . High rate algal ponds are preferred for wastewater treatment with shallow depth helps microalgae to proliferate and produce high biomass.

Tan et al. 2017 utilized closed rectangular tanks of 175L capacity used for biomass production from Chlorella pyrenoi- dosa using alcohol wastewater. Food industrial efﬂu- ents are treated in the outdoor MaB-ﬂoc raceway pond showed 20 removal of phosphorous with biomass productivity of 31.3 tons total suspended solids ha pond year Hende et al. 2016 . Rose oil processing wastewater is used for the cultivation of Chlorella sp. in raceway reactor showed that better removal of organic and inorganic nutrients. The component analysis of the resulting biomass showed suitable for application as a biofertilizer Uysal and Ekinci 2021 . It has been reported that open raceway pond cultiva- tion of Nanochloropsis in different geographical locations under outdoor conditions showed that biomass productivity is varied from 2000 to 700 t km-2 year -1. The study showed that microalgae growth robustly depends on local climatic factors like direct and indirect solar radiations wind velocity ambient air temperature and relative humidity Ban- erjee and Ramaswamy 2019 . The limitation of the open system is contamination due to microorganisms and protozoa along with unfavorable weather condi- tions that could hamper the biomass productivity even total loss of desired strains. The presence of rotifers in the open pond system causes a culture crash and eventually reduced the biomass yields. The shading effects due to low penetration light ineffective photosynthesis also affect biomass production in these cultivation systems. Growth relevant parameters such as temperature pH and light availability cannot be regulated. Summer periods evaporations are still challenging issues in open systems Ummalyma et al. 2021 . Large open outdoor systems are used for the cultivation of many microalgae species for resource recovery from wastewater for sustainable bioreﬁnery products. Closed cultivation systems Closed cultivation systems are potential for the controlling and physiological conditions of microal- gae. The bioreactor used for controlled growing of microalgae is a photobioreactor PBR . PBR is a commonly used closed system for biomass production and construction and design are determined based on the microalgae strain selected for cultivation. The PBR explored for microalgae cultivation required high operating and capital costs. However this system is efﬁcient for high biomass production with proper control of culture parameters which assist in prevent- ing contamination problems compared with an open system. In PBR the intensity of irradiation the ﬂow rate of air and CO2 agitation and pH can be controlled according to the ideal conditions suitable for microal- gae strain. In photobioreactor microalgae can be cultivated under the desired mode of growth hetero- trophic mixotrophic and phototrophic for that external supply of carbon source and inorganic carbon could be provided for better microalgae growth and biomass production. The limitation of the system is biofouling and cleaning. There are many types of closed PBR are available depending on the shape geometry and material used for the construction such as ﬂat-plate tubular bubble column and hybrid PBR. Commonly used PBR is horizontal tubular PBR for microalgae cultivation due to high biomass produc- tivity bubble column and airlift are normally used in large-scale industries Yin et al. 2020 Bhatia et al. 2021 Ummalyma et al. 2021 . For the low-value products biofuel utilization of PBR is not cost- effective but it is useful for the making of high-value lucrative products. Fluidized bed photobioreactor used for the biomass production and nutrients removal in palm oil mill efﬂuent showed that 90 removal of phosphorous and nitrogen. The maximum biomass production of 3.2 g L with 0.36 g L of lipid from Nannochloropsis sp Cheirsilp et al. 2017 . Pilot-scale tubular photobioreactors are used for the cultivation of Chlorella pyrenoidosa using food processing wastew- ater. Biomass production ranges between 1.8 2.1 g L with 15 of lipid with effective pollutants removal 55 COD 67 total phosphorous and 88 of total nitrogen Tan et al. 2021 . Utilization of photo bioreactor containing shrimp wastewater for the cultivation of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was used for biomass production and conversion of bioplastic poly-b-hydroxybutyrate PHB . The study showed that 96 phosphate 98 ammonia 80 nitrates and 67 nitrite were removed from the wastewater and biomass is accumulated with 32 DCW of PHB Krasaesueb et al. 2019 . Tubular photobioreactor operated continuously for the cultivation Tetraselmis suecica in ﬁsh processing industry showed the biomass production of 1 g L with 49 removal of nitrogen and 99 removal of phosphorous 123 Phytochem Rev respectively. The ﬁnal biomass is applied for feed application for juvenile shellﬁsh Michiel et al. 2014 . Photobioreactors are used for the cultivation of monoalgae and consortium for biomass production using dairy wastewater. Result showed that microal- gae consortium consists of Chlorella and Scenedus- mus sp. produced higher biomass of 5.1 5.4 g L with removal of 62.86 COD and phosphorous of 95.96 . The monoculture of Chlorella sp. produced 4.72 g L Qin et al. 2016 . Hybrid system A hybrid cultivation system HCS is designed for the amalgamation of two or more cultivation systems to produce biomass and resource recovery from wastew- ater. The HCS is integrated with an open system photobioreactor and certain cases with algal turf scrubber Bhatia et al. 2021 SundarRajan et al. 2019 . In this system optimum cultivation condition is maintained in the ﬁrst stage for accelerating biomass production yield and the second stage expose biomass into the stressful environment to enhance the desired product. It has been reported that average areal biomass productivity in HCS is higher than the non- hybrid systems. It is 46 to 74 higher than open systems and 12.5 enhancement of biomass than PBRs Liu et al. 2018 Tan et al. 2017b . HCS can be considered as a better approach for monoculture biomass production of oleaginous microalgae. The report showed that 47 days of HCS cultivation of microalgae efﬁciently produced biomass from the target microalgal strains Yun et al. 2018 . This system is suitable for wastewater coupling with microalgae for getting the maximum beneﬁt of each reactor which helps in the reduction of the production cost of each kilogram of microalgal biomass Salama et al. 2017 . Cultivation of Tetraselmis sp. was used in HCS containing closed photobioreactor and open pond for enhancing the lipid yield. First microalgae are culti- vated in 1200L PBR followed by second cultivated in 1000L open raceway pond with nutrients deﬁcient media. The study showed that HCS produced more lipid yield compared to single-phase cultivation either in PBR or open ponds used as a control. Maximum biomass productivity obtained in a hybrid system is 0.5 gm-2 days per solar irradiation of 1 kWhm-2 Narala et al. 2016 . Production of biomass from target microalgae strains from the algal feeders in the open pond is a challenge in the industry. In such a case the hybrid system is advantageous to produce biomass from desired microalgae. Yun et al. 2018 utilized a PBR-open raceway pond hybrid system for the cultivation of microalgae. Here PBR act as a contin- uous supply of inoculum of target microalgae to sustain microalgae growth and biomass production in an open raceway pond. Cultivation of Scenedesmus obtusiusculus in hybrid photobioreactors showed that biomass concentration of 1.2 g L with a 0.38 day of speciﬁc growth rate and biomass productivity of 41.8 mg L day using ﬂue gas supplementation Estrada-Graf et al. 2020 . Mechanisms of nutrients absorption by microalgae Wastewater contains both inorganic and organic nutrients. The mechanism of nutrient absorption is not well understood in microalgae. Food industrial wastewater is enriched with inorganic nutrients of nitrate nitrite and organic nitrogen phosphates and CO2.These are the essential nutrients for the growth and reproduction of microalgae. Microalgae can consume both CO2 and HCO3 ions for their photo- synthetic process. Microalgae can able to ﬁx CO2 to produce organic matter by utilizing NADPH and ATP generated through the light reaction of photosynthesis. The detailed mechanism of the Calvin cycle and CO2 concentration mechanism is previously reported by Su et al. 2021 . Nitrogen is the crucial micronutrient required for the growth and reproduction and vital components of many microalgae cellular compounds. It is required for the synthesis of organic nitrogenous compounds inside the cell such as ATP DNA and RNA Barsanti and Gualtieri 2006 . During the assimilation process microalgae convert inorganic nitrogen into organic nitrogen. The oxidized forms of inorganic nitrogen are translocated from the plasma membranes and undergo reduction to produce ammonia and ﬁnally incorpo- rated into amino acids. The nitrogen metabolisms are linked with carbon metabolism inside the cell. The incorporation of ammonium ions to amino acids required a carbon backbone in the form of keto acid originated from oxaloacetate energy in the form of ATP NDPH are used as reducing agents sfor the synthesis of amino acid aspartate glutamine and glutamate Lea and Miﬁn 2003 . The nitrate and nitrates are reduced to ammonium ions by two 123 Phytochem Rev enzymes such as nitrate reductase and nitrite reduc- tases respectively. Nitrate reductase converts nitrate to nitrite by utilizing NADH and pyrimidine nucleo- tides for transferring two electrons. Later nitrite reductase reduces nitrite to ammonium ions by utilizing ferredoxin as an electron donor. Finally the glutamine synthase enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the ammonium ions to glutamate using ATP mole- cules to convert glutamine Fernandez and Galvan 2007 . Another less energy expensive nitrogen source is ammonium preferred by microalgae. Transport proteins belonging to the ammonium transporter family are involved in the transport of ammonia across the membranes. These protein families are detected in diatoms and Chlamydomonas Maestrini et al. 1986 . Phosphorous also play an important role in the metabolic process and is found in proteins lipids and nucleic acids. Phosphorous fund in wastewater is in the form of polyphosphate organic phosphate and orthophosphate. The phosphate is assimilated by microalgae and incorporated in the nucleic acids proteins and lipids during the biosyn- thetic process through phosphorylation and synthesis of ATP Martinez et al. 1999 . The excess available in the form of orthophosphate can be stored as polyphos- phate granules within the cells for future use. Organic carbons present in the food industrial wastewater are mainly consisting of fructose galac- tose glucose alcohol lactose and organic acids. Responds to these compounds are depend on the species-speciﬁc and concentration Perez-Garcia et al. 2011 . It has been reported that the carbohydrate transport system is involved in the metabolism which is energy-dependent and stimulated by irradiance Morales-Sa nchez et al. 2015 . Glucose is an organic carbon substrate commonly consumed among microalgae Ummalyma and Sukumaran 2015 . In wastewater microalgae are mostly undergoing a mixotrophic mode of growth. The glucose is metab- olized in the cytosol by two different metabolic pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway PPP in the absence of light and Embden Meyerhof Pathway EMP in the presence of lights Perez-Garcia et al. 2011 . Metabolism of carbon by microalgae mainly undergoes glycolysis pentose phosphate path- ways PP phosphorylation and TCA cycle. Glucose utilizing microalgae metabolize glucose through gly- colysis TCA cycle and NADPH synthesizing pool and assist the biosynthesis of the product via the acetyl-CoA route. Fructose is utilized in glycolysis pathway catalyzed by hexokinase Su et al. 2021 . Microalgae utilizing C5 sugars are metabolized by PP pathways. The report showed that Botryococcus braunii consumed mannose by PP pathways in presence of light Tanoi et al. 2011 . Mannose utilized by Schizochytrium sp. for biomass production. It has been reported that EMP pathway oxidative phospho- rylation and TCA cycle are continued in mitochondria with the presence of glucose under different growth mode phototrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic in Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Synechocystis sp. Yang et al. 2000 Hong et al. 2007 . Acetate is another carbon found in wastewaters. Assimilation of acetate is mediated by acetylation of coenzyme- A assisted by acetyl-CoA synthetase to form acetyl-CoA with the help of ATP molecule Droop 1974 Boyle and Morgan 2009 . Acetate metabolism occurs in mitochondria and glyoxysomes through TCA cycle and glyoxylate cycle for the incorporation of acetyl clusters into the carbon skeleton. Alcohols present in the winery wastewaters undergo oxidations to acetaldehyde and acetate by two enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase present in the cytosol and mitochondria. Later acetate is converted to acetyl coenzyme A via acetyl-CoA synthetase which enters into glyoxylate cycle and TCA cycle. Acetyl-CoA is used for NADH biosynthesis in the TCA cycle and converted to succinate and malate by isocitrate lyase and malate synthase Ono et al. 1995 Yoval-Sanchez et al. 2011 . Microalgae such as Arthrospira sp. Scenedesmus sp. Chlorella sp. and diatoms are reported microalgae species for the assimilation of alcohols from the growth medium for biomass and bioproduct accumulation Bezerra et al. 2014 Mat- sudo et al. 2016 . Amino acids present in the wastewater are absorbed via the glutamate-glutamine pathway and stored as amino acids and intermediate molecules which are used in the other biochemical process Chen et al. 2017 . The simplest representa- tion of nutrient uptake by microalgae are represented in Fig. 1. Biomass harvesting strategies Algal biomass harvesting refers to the detachment of algae from its nutrient growth medium using 123 Phytochem Rev suitable techniques such as ﬂocculation centrifuga- tion ﬂoatation ﬁltration and a combination of these techniques. The selection of a suitable method of harvesting depends on certain harvesting traits or requirements that deal with the cost processing time biomass species and quality separation efﬁciency and toxicity Singh and Patidar 2018 . Microalgae have a negative surface charge and density is also equal to the growth medium and hence always remains cells are dispersed in the medium. However several harvesting methods are adopted for neutralizing the microalgal surface change for effective dewatering of microalgal biomass from the media Ummalyma et al. 2017 . Floatation ﬂocculation ﬁltration sedimentation and centrifugation are the most commonly used methods for algae harvesting Xu et al. 2021 . In the ﬂoatation technique small bubbles are produced using either dissolved air or dispersed air mechanisms Ndikubwimana et al. 2016 . The generated bubbles attach themselves to the microalgae cells and ﬂoat them to the surface due to lower density that enables easy algal biomass harvesting at low energy demands. Although the ﬂoatation technique is time saving efﬁcient requires low space and can be used for large- scale harvesting it has certain disadvantages. For instance if the bubbles produced are oversized it could break up the ﬂoc and therefore surfactants are usually needed for a stabile ﬂoc. In recent studies there has been a discussion on ballasted ﬂoatation that would use a bubble less system generated from low- density materials LDMs for harvesting free-ﬂoating microalgae Xu et al. 2021 . The said LDMs in the newly developed ballasted ﬂoatation could include microspheres made of sodium borosilicate glass ﬂy ash or waste cooking oil that would increase the solid liquid separation efﬁciency at the harvesting surface Zhang and Zhang 2019 . In ﬂocculation chemical salts aluminium and iron are added to the algal Fig. 1 Simple representation of nutrient uptake metabolism by microalgae from wastewater 123 Phytochem Rev biomass media to promote the aggregation of microal- gal cells to form a ﬂoc. Caetano et al. reported that modulation of pH or the addition of CaCl2 for the harvesting of Arthrospira maxima showed that alka- line pH and CaCl2 concentrations improved the efﬁciency of biomass harvesting Caetano et al. 2020 . The chemical ﬂocculants are generally toxic and need an additional treatment process for their removal that contributes to the processing cost Rinanti and Purwadi 2018 . To tackle this problem several bioﬂocculants made from chitosan and acrylic acid based biopolymers were developed which were more eco-friendly which could attain 90 cell recov- ery as compared to 95 in chemical ﬂocculants Zhu et al. 2018 . Bioﬂocculation or auto-ﬂocculations happens mainly due to the secretion of biopolymers of extra- cellular polymeric substances. Reports showed that biopolymers produced by microbes and microalgae are used for biomass harvesting from the wastewater for low-cost microalgal bioreﬁneries. Utilization of poly-c-glutamic acids produced from B.licheniformis for the harvesting of microalgae Desmodesmis sp. showed 98 ﬂocculation efﬁciency Ndikubwimana et al.2016 . EPS produced by Scenedesmus acumina- tus are used for the ﬂocculation of the same microalgae and the harvesting efﬁciency 80 . Low molecular weight EPS composed of mannose and glucose inﬂuences the microalgal biomass harvesting process Yang et al. 2020 . Detailed bio-ﬂocculation tech- niques and their ﬂocculation mechanisms are dis- cussed in a review reported by Ummalyma et al. 2017 . Electromembrane ﬁltration and ultraﬁltration are also used for the harvesting of microalgae biomass. The huge advantage of these methods is to support the separation process based on charge and molecular weight. Electromembrane ﬁltration is a very useful method for harvesting Chlorella sp. KR-1 improves four fold 6.47 concentration factors Kim et al. 2014 . Biomass quantity biomass quality operational cost processing time species speciﬁc and toxicity are the main criteria to choose the suitable harvesting techniques Singh and Patidar 2018 . According to these criterions coagulation ﬂocculation centrifuga- tion and ﬁltration are the widely used techniques for microalgae harvesting. These techniques can be used alone or in combinations for raising the harvesting efﬁciency. Filtration and coagulation are effective techniques for high quality and quantity of cells but economically not feasible because of high operating and capital cost. Flotation and ﬂocculation are fast easy and can be used at large scale with low space requirement but use of chemical may be expensive and chances of contamination is also very high. Centrifu- gation harvesting is fast convenient and suitable for all strain of microalgae but operating and maintenance cost make the process costly for large scale harvesting. Flocculation followed by gravity sedimentation is best and low cost operation among different combination of harvesting techniques. Products from microalgae Microalgae are rich in high-value metabolites like carbohydrates proteins lipids pigments essential fatty acids vitamins minerals etc. Udayan et al. 2021 . Microalgae have been considered as a potential feedstock for biofuels food supplements and phar- maceuticals because of their high nutrient proﬁle Udayan et al. 2017 . Microalgal cells consist of a high amount of lipids proteins and carbohydrates which favors the production of biofuels Culaba et al. 2020 . But the industrialization of microalgal metabolites is still in early stages because of the high cost of large- scale cultivation. Microalgal biomass production together with industrial wastewater management can be considered as a cost-effective method to reduce the needed for freshwater and fertilizers needed for microalgal growth Jayaseelan et al. 2021 . Cultiva- tion of algae in wastewater increases the biomass and secondary metabolite production suitable for bioreﬁn- ery product conversions because of the high nutrient load in the wastewater and also helps in wastewater treatment Ummalyma et al. 2020 Ren et al. 2018 . Fatty acids and oils The processing of wastewater using microalgae leads to the accumulation of fatty acids and oils and this bioprocess has gained much attraction from both industrial and research areas for the production of nutraceuticals pharmaceuticals biofuels and oleo- chemical industries Leong et al. 2021 . Microalgae can able to accumulate 30 80 of lipids in their cells Yong et al. 2020 . Lipids can be polar and non-polar. Polar lipids like phospholipids glycolipids etc. are 123 Phytochem Rev used as integral constituents of cell membranes and non-polar lipids like triglycerides sterols etc. are stored as energy reserves D Allessandro and Anto- niosi 2016 . Depending upon the cultivation condi- tions microalgae accumulate TAG as lipid droplets. In terms of fatty acid composition microalgae contain different types of fatty acids like saturated fatty acids SFA monounsaturated fatty acids MUFA and polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA Udayan et al. 2017 . PUFAs are a nutritionally important class of fatty acids with proven health beneﬁts Udayan et al. 2021 . Omega 3 PUFAs gained more attention recently especially during the Coronavirus pandemic conditions due to their antioxidant activities immune regulation inﬂammation reduction prevention of cardiovascular and neurological disease conditions Udayan et al. 2017 2021 . Docosahexaenoic acid DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA are the two important essential omega-3 fatty acids derived from microalgae. When microalgae are subjected to different types of environmental stress and cultivation conditions they will accumulate fatty acids and oils. Wastewaters released from different industries are rich in nutrients that support microalgal growth and metabolite pro- duction. Co-cultivation of microalgae with other bacteria will also help to increase lipid productivity Sun et al. 2019 . Different stress factors increase the microalgal lipid and fatty acid accumulation by changing the carbon ﬂow conversion redox balance and stress hormone levels which regulate lipid biosynthesis and conversion Yew et al. 2019 . Microalgae achieve high biomass content in a nutri- ent-rich wastewater medium which supports lipid productivity in later stages of growth. For biodiesel properties SFAs are more effective because PUFAs are not suitable for the stability of the fuel. PUFAs can be considered as edible oil which helps to maintain the health and balance of the human body Udayan et al. 2021 . Different strategies are adopted to increase the PUFA content in microalgae like treatment with wastewater nutrient stress plant growth regulators temperature salinity UV radiation etc. Udayan et al. 2018 Udayan and Arumugam 2017 Udayan et al. 2020 Yew et al. 2019 Sun et al.2019 . Table 2 represents the different lipid yield obtained from microalgae cultivated in wastewaters. Pigments Cultivation of different microalgae and cyanobacteria in wastewater has been considered as an effective method for biomass and natural pigments production while improving the quality of water Acien Fernan- dez et al. 2018 . Microalgae can recycle the nutrients present in the wastewater reduce energy consumption and provide oxygen also which has speciﬁc environ- mental beneﬁts Acien et al. 2016 . Natural pigments from microalgae and cyanobacteria have attracted industries such as textile cosmetics pharmaceutical and food Pagels et al. 2019 . The main photosynthetic pigments from microalgae are chlorophylls carote- noids and phycobilins Udayan and Arumugam 2017a . Recently many researchers have been focused on the production of these natural pigments from microalgae using wastewater because of its pharma- ceutical and industrial needs Ajijah et al. 2020 . Chlorella vulgaris grown in tofu wastewater has shown increased carotenoid content of 72.20 mg L Ajijah et al. 2020 . Phormidium autumnale cultivated in slaughterhouse wastewater in a bubble column reactor has increased the lutein beta carotene violax- anthin zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin production Rodrigues et al.2014 . Palm oil municipal efﬂuent 1 used for the commercial outdoor cultivation of Spirulina platensis increased biomass content to 1.8 g L and phycocyanin content to 12.01 after 7 days of cultivation Sukumaran et al. 2014 . Chlorella vul- garis cultivated in synthetic wastewater showed high biomass production 1.087 g L Wang et al. 2015 . In another study C.zoﬁngensis cultivated in wastewater from the molasses production unit showed increased astaxanthin productivity 1.7 mg L Liu et al. 2012 . Mixotrophic cultivation of Chlamydomonas aci- dophila in wastewater conducted in a 1L batch reactor increased the production of lutein 9 mg g and zeaxanthin 7 mg g Cuaresma et al. 2011 . For large-scale production of pigments from microalgae some challenges must be addressed such as the high cost associated with upstream and down- stream processing. Currently the use of wastewater in the cultivation media is shown to reduce the cost of cultivation. However the bacterial contamination and presence of toxic metals in the wastewater make it unsuitable for food applications directly Acien et al. 2016 . 123 Phytochem Rev Exopolysaccharides Exopolysaccharides EPS are group of high molec- ular weight biopolymers secreted by microalgae to the external environment during their growth and meta- bolism Xiao et al. 2016 . EPS can be seen either weakly attached to the microalgal cell wall or secreted into the external environment Trabelsi et al. 2016 . Microalgae are the potential producers of EPS especially red algae and cyanobacteria. The major function of EPS is to protect the cells from stress conditions cell to cell communication adhesion and bioﬁlm formation Dertli et al. 2015 . In the food industry EPS has been used as thickeners and gelling agents which helps to improve the texture and quality of food Feldmane et al. 2013 . EPS also possesses potential antibacterial antiviral anticancer and antioxidant properties which help in the development of novel pharmaceuticals Table 3 . Because the EPS are secreted externally to the culture medium it can be easily extracted and puriﬁed Bafanaa et al. 2013 . Even though EPS has many potential applications the yield from microalgae is the major limitation in the scale-up industry. The type and concentration of EPS obtained from microalgae mainly depend on cultiva- tion system design nutrient and cultivation condi- tions as well as extraction and puriﬁcation process. Therefore the usage of wastewater can solve this problem up to one extent.

Microalgal biomass has been attracted and great interest as a renewable and sustainable source for the production of bioenergy. Bioethanol made from microalgal biomass 3rd generation biofuel is also an environmentally friendly beneﬁcial fuel. Microal- gae can store large amount of carbohydrates within the cells as triacylglycerol and starch under different conditions. The carbohydrates can be effectively used as a carbon source or substrate during fermentation for the production of bioethanol Dexter et al. 2015 . Microalgae are also able to accumulate protein along with carbohydrates and lipids under unfavorable conditions. Microalgae breakdown the complex nitro- gen molecules into proteins. The difference in salinity light intensity temperature and nutrient load can also accumulate carbohydrates. The absence of lignin and low hemicellulose levels makes hydrolysis and fer- mentation yields in microalgae more efﬁcient Gon- zalez et al. 2018 . Microalgae like Chlorella Dunaliella Scenedesmus Arthrospira and Spirulina have been used for the production of bioethanol Schneidner et al. 2013 . These microalgae are con- sidered as potential candidates because of the high amount of starch and glycogen which are the impor- tant factors for the production of bioethanol. In bioethanol production the processes depend upon the type of biomass and selection of pretreat- ment sacchariﬁcation fermentation and product recovery. The pretreatment of the biomass is a crucial process because it is essential for the recovery of sugars used in the fermentation process. However it is necessary to develop a well-designed and efﬁcient system for the cultivation of microalgae that can remove compounds that cause impurities in the ﬁnal product. Moreover studies are needed to develop an efﬁcient bioreﬁnery system using wastewater for the production of bioethanol from microalgae. Biochar Microalgae are considered as the potent candidate for biochar production because of their sustainable and renewable biomass properties Yu et al. 2017 . Biochar conversion from microalgae is a promising approach that is associated with the development of value-added products after the production of biofuel from microalgae. Many reports are available on the pyrolysis of microalgae but studies that focus on the byproducts are very few. Algal biochar developed from the treatment of wastewater can be considered as a future technology by using biomass for the gener- ation of carbon-negative energy with environmental applications Yu et al. 2017 . But the high nutrient content in microalgae is a major disadvantage in pyrolysis. One possible solution for this problem is the speciﬁc extraction of lipids from algae for bio-oil production and the remaining residues can be used for the production of biochar in the bioreﬁnery. Microal- gae have been considered as the potential feedstock for future sustainable energy sources without depending on fossil fuels and the cultivation of microalgae can be efﬁciently used to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases Vassilev and Vassileva 2016 . Biochar derived from microalgae is gaining more importance because of its long-term advantage in carbon sequestration and soil amendment properties in agriculture. Photosynthesis helps in the carbon dioxide uptake in biochar technology and the captured carbon undergoes pyrolysis to synthesis biochar with speciﬁc long-term carbon storage using soil amendment Yu et al. 2017 . The biochar derived from biomass has more than 90 carbon. Moreover the biochar derived from microalgae is rich in nitrogen and other nutrients which can be used as a fertilizer in agriculture. All these advantages make possibilities of algal biochar in an economically feasible manner soon. However till now there is limited research data is available on the production of algal biochar and its utilization. Various possible bioproducts recovered from the sustainable wastewater-based microalgal bioreﬁnery are repre- sented in Fig. 2. Research needs and perspectives Mass production of microalgae for bioreﬁnery must join with centralized food industrial wastewater for addressing sustainability. Microalgae cultivation sys- tem with wastewater treatment needs to be improved for the proper nutrient absorption and uptake mech- anism also unraveled for better understanding of microalgae nutrients absorption from wastewater for target product for bioreﬁnery. Biomass harvesting 123 Phytochem Rev from the wastewater is still a challenging issue bio- ﬂocculation process needs to be focused on the possibilities of lucrative products and full-scale oper- ation of microalgae for wastewater treatment. Microalgae research needs to be focused towards the possibility of self-ﬂocculation of microalgae for harvesting of biomass and organic matter released into the medium as ﬂocculation enhancing molecule and its mechanism of biomass ﬂocculation need to be explore. Wastewater contains may contain toxic molecules that can be can be resolved by focusing the isolation of robust microalgal strains resistant to infection by other algal feeders and other microorganisms capable of aggregate formation the potential for auto-ﬂocculations helps protection from microalgae feeders. Another challenging issue by the cultivation of microalgae in wastewater is their non- sterile environments stimulate the growth of algal feeders protozoans and others. Research could be directed towards co-culturing of microalgae obtained from food industrial wastewater could produce more biomass with stable growth meanwhile adapts to the ecological niches that avoids the possibilities of culture crash and contamination problems that helps in reducing the production cost and will improve wastewater treatment efﬁciently Mohsenpour et al. Fig. 2 Sustainable microalgal bioreﬁnery products coupled with food industrial wastewater 123 Phytochem Rev 2021 . Application study for microalgae strain improvement using the technology of gene editing would solve several existing issues with algal biomass and metabolites. Challenges of microalgae are need to be addressed by progress in the technological innova- tions at many supply chains to produce enough biomass feedstock and target products at prof- itable production costs to increase competitiveness in industry. Conclusion Microalgae cultivation in food industrial wastewater is advantageous to achieve the dual role of nutrients removal and low-cost biomass production. This review thoroughly summarized the different sources of food industrial efﬂuents with mass production of microalgae in various cultivation systems. The biomass harvesting process and processing of different bio-products conversions from the biomass were also discussed elaborately. Therefore the selection of robust species could be very crucial for wastewater treatment resistance to tolerate adverse environmental conditions self-ﬂocculation and algal feeders with biomass generation for multi-bioreﬁnery products. Integration of microalgae biomass production with wastewater generates renewable bioproducts and offers multiple beneﬁts to the environment and energy sector.

The consumption of fossil fuels is an example with increasing levels of exploitation and negative impacts caused by their use. Anthropogenic activities have triggered the over accumulation of many hazardous substances and wastes which are regarded to be detrimental to life in the Earth and to the various planet ecosystems. There is an urgent need to restore natural resources and unwanted residues and wastes to levels prior the de- mographic explosion. Microalgal biotechnology appears to be pivotal to achieve this goal in a near future to come. This review presents the current resource problems affecting the Earth and how microalgae are expected to be an important part of the solution discussing how the production of renewable energy from microalgae can help in an integrated way to mitigate different environmental problems. Microalgae are able to convert wastewaters CO2 and organic residues in marketable biomass for different uses including biofuels converting waste in value.

Introduction The ﬁrst step in solving a problem is to recognize its existence. Currently serious environmental problems such as water scarcity and climate change which can trigger serious social problems on a global scale are related to the exponential growth of population urbanization intensive use disordered land and fossil fuels. In this context the United Nations launched the 2030 Agenda establish- ing 17 sustainable development goals SDGs setting objectives in different sectors of society with the aim of guiding actions towards improving people s living conditions 1 . SDG addresses 7 issues related to affordable and clean energy. The use of fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas emits approximately 6 billion t of carbon dioxide CO2 into the atmosphere 2 . In 2018 the energy consumed worldwide was in the order of 14 279 569 ktoe of which approximately 14 came from renewable sources such as hydropower solar wind biofuels and waste 3 . Despite the advancement of renewable energy al- ternatives in recent years their use is limited in view of the po- tential that presents 4 and mainly in view of the urgent need for a paradigm shift in the sector. In this context the use of microalgae for the production of 3rd generation biofuels is gaining more and more attention. Algal biomass can be used to produce different biofuels such as biodiesel biogas bioethanol and bio-oil overcoming some of the main dif- ﬁculties of 1st and 2nd generation biofuels 5 . The energy content of biofuels obtained from microalgae can reach values of the order of 35 800 kJ kg 1 for crude oil 6 38 100 kJ kg 1 for bio-oil 7 and 39 900 kJ m 3 for biogas 8 . Microalgae have a high photosynthetic rate compared to higher plants 6 which means high biomass productivity. In addition they can develop in areas unsuitable for agriculture 9 avoiding conﬂict related to food security and can be Corresponding author. E-mail address H. Vieira de Mendonça .

Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 i An update to this article is included at the end produced during the wastewater treatment 10e12 considered as a nutrient recycling without requiring potable water for its cultivation. In a society that increasingly seeks speciﬁc solutions to speciﬁc problems acting on environmental issues is a signiﬁcant challenge. Therefore this review aims to discuss how the production of renewable energy from microalgae can help to mitigate in an in- tegrated way different environmental problems. This review follows an innovative systemic approach. This introduction section 1.1 highlights the recent problems affecting the Earth which are being detrimental to life in every way thus affecting the mankind. Later new broadly recognized solutions will be listed in order to overcome previous listed problems sections 2.1. and 2.2 . Furthermore the text goes deeper in detail con- cerning the uses of microalgae in the ﬁght of the abovementioned problems sections 2.3 and 3 highlighting the technological ﬂex- ibility of microalgae to solve problems locally chapter 4 . The performance of microalgae will be carefully presented with quantitative indicators related to carbon GHG bioﬁxation section 2.3.1 wastewater treatment 2.3.2 as practical and proven tools for resource recovery in the frame of a new green-bioeconomy. Chapter 3 covers extensively bio-based products and biofuels from microalgae highlighting pathways processes and yields productivities acting as crucial data for the further development of microalgal-based bioreﬁneries regardless the type. Later on a worldwide survey of already existing microalgae-based bio- reﬁneries of different technological readiness levels and size will be carried out on chapter 5 for the very ﬁrst time as authors know . Finally on chapter 6 a list of worldwide current microalgal pro- ducers already established in the market will be presented giving more emphasis to the commercial impact of microalgae in a global world. The main purpose of chapter 6 is to demonstrate that the microalgal exploitation is a current reality worldwide and a wide array of biobased products from this feedstock can replace fossil- based products already in the market with either environmental or sustainability advantage. 1.1. Old and recurring problems 1.1.1. Water scarcity Water scarcity has been a determinant factor in several parts of the world being required an efﬁcient management of water re- sources. In addition to the uneven geographical distribution of water resources climate change is increasingly imposing severe seasonal restrictions on places that did not have this concern. Sci- entiﬁc evidence conﬁrms that the climate on the planet is changing thus affecting societies and the environment 13 . These change generates extreme climatic events associated with intense popu- lation growth and affects the water availability and quality for basic human needs 14 . Consequently water resources became a concern across the globe. Moreover economic development changes in consumption patterns intensiﬁcation of demand for inputs agricultural and energy products generate an increase in demand for water re- sources 15 making their availability increasingly uncertain in the near future 13 14 . Approximately 2 billion people live in countries with some degree of water stress and about 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. The water demand is expected to increase between 20 and 30 by 2050 compared to current levels 16 . Water is the primordial resource for agricultural and industrial services. While only 2.7 of the worldwide water is available as freshwater only 30 of this water can be consumed for meeting human needs 17 18 . With the meteorological hydrological changes associated with increased water pollution there is an urgent need for adaptation in water management worldwide 19 20 . 1.1.2. Overpopulation and resource scarcity It is evident that the increase in population has been causing greater demand for resources not only for water but also for food services and energy intensifying the biosphere degradation 21 . According to the United Nations it is expected that in the next 30 years the world population will grow by up to 2 billion reaching 9.7 billion inhabitants in 2050 16 . The cities with higher population densities consume between 60 and 80 of all global energy and as a consequence generate about 75 of all CO2 emitted in the globe 22 . Based on a non-organized growth model many cities suffer due to the high consumption of energy and water generating a large quantity of pollution 23 caused by demand from its tech- nological infrastructures. Since the industrial revolution the world population has been intensively exploring non-renewable resources affecting the eco- systems with the objective to supplier their needs. As a conse- quence ecosystems have been disturbed or even destroyed at an accelerated pace making impossible it s natural restoration 24 . De Bhowmick et al. 25 described that with the rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources it is unlikely that there will be an oil reserve after 2050 and adds that emissions from this energy source will cause irreparable environmental damage. In this scenario the world faces the increasing scarcity of conventional energy re- sources which would result in a race to adapt to the new world scenario and search for new means for the production of clean energy 26 . According to Trevors 27 humanity is addicted to oil extracted from hydrocarbons one of the main sources of green- house gas emissions GHG which are also potential contaminants of soils and oceans. According to the author it is important to realize an energy conservation program with the objective of the gradual replacement of fossil fuels with other less-polluting energy sources such as the use of biomass for the production of several biofuels such as biodiesel bio-oil bioethanol and biogas bio- methane including the adoption of huge energy efﬁciency practices. 1.1.3. Overcontamination soil water and GHG With economic development today s society consumed many more goods and products increasing the production of solid wastes and wastewaters 28 29 . High GHG emissions are also a growing problem. It s estimated that the amount of urban solid wastes generated worldwide is approximately 2.01 billion t per year. The forecast is this amount will exceed 3.40 billion t per year by 2050 30 . With these values it is expected the incorrect deposition of contami- nated residues in the soil as well as underground aquifers and surface waters. The main contaminants are usually heavy metals besides nitrates phenolic compounds hydrocarbons among others 31 . Many agricultural products accumulate these elements and can cause severe damage to human and animal health since ingestion is one of the main contamination routes. Regarding wastewater a report issued by UNESCO 32 recorded that only 8 of domestic and industrial wastewater is treated in countries with low-income. In high-income countries the average percentage is 70 . The release of untreated wastewater can deplete dissolved oxygen in watercourses leading to the death of the aquatic ecosystem. The nutrients contained in wastewater intensify eutrophication another serious environmental problem that exists since the middle of the 20th century 33 . Forest deforestation and the production and consumption of food as well as the production of fuels wood manufactured goods roads buildings transportation power generation among others H. Vieira de Mendonça P. Assemany M. Abreu et al. Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 843 are human activities responsible for GHGs emissions. Many times the data are expressed in terms of the amount of CO2 or its equivalent of other GHGs emitted to the atmosphere 34 . Fig. 1 shows approximate percentage values of CO2 emissions by the main countries. Mahmud et al. 35 evaluated the CO2 emission through different power generation plants. When comparing the emission of gas in power generation systems by hydroelectric plants versus biomass values of 1 020 and 42.8 CO2eq kWh 1 were obtained respectively. In other words using biomass to generate electricity CO2 emissions are 24 times lower when compared with the hy- droelectric power plants. The production of energy from hydro- electric plants despite being a source of clean energy generate GHG into the atmosphere due to the fact that the reservoirs built emit gases such as CO2 methane CH4 and oxide nitrous N2O 36 . Thus the use of biomass is more advantageous for clean en- ergy generation since avoids dam construction where the waters become rich in nutrients increasing aquatic primary production which causes water eutrophication and high GHG emissions 36 37 . In this scenario occur an increase in the global demand for energy allied to the use of non-renewable energy sources. For these reasons exists the need to seek alternative sources that are less polluting and other solutions to reduce environmental damage 38 . 2. New solutions 2.1. Water recycling One possibility for the water resources management is to diversify supply alternatives through unconventional water sour- ces. In this context the use of treated efﬂuents as a potential source of water supply for several activities stands out with the additional beneﬁt of reducing the negative impacts of their discharge into the environment 39 . Treated domestic sewage can represent an important source for activities that do not require drinking water increasing supply security and reducing the energy consumption and other inputs in water treatment systems. Domestic sewage can supply water regardless of the time of year unlike other possible sources such as rainwater 40 . The water reuse has potential applications in many activities in agriculture irrigation of cultivated areas in industries reintroduction in the production process in reﬁlling under- ground aquifers and in urban uses ﬁre prevention street cleaning and landscape harmony 41e44 . Many studies have been devel- oped in order to expand the water reuse in the industrial scope. Aquim et al. 42 evaluated the use of the efﬂuent from the leather industry after treatment by ﬂotation and sieving. The treatment promoted the reduction of oils greases and also chromium. Au- thors stated that with the water reuse it is possible to save up to 36 000 L per day and reduce the consumption of chemicals in the process by up to 10 times. Buscio et al. 45 studied the water reuse in the textile industry using a treatment consisted of an electro- chemical system assisted by UV radiation. Colour removal varied from 64 to 99 meeting the production requirements and allowing 70 a reduction in water consumption. Tiwari et al. 46 evaluated the optimization of a wastewater treatment plant of the largest dairy industry in India in order to improve the water reuse process. The authors stated that the implementation of the improvement measures could allow the reuse of 100 of the efﬂuent. In addition the plant may have a positive energy balance through the production of biogas and a reduction in the energy consumption of aerators. As mentioned agriculture represents one of the main activities for water reuse since it is responsible for around 70 of water demand worldwide 47 . This high consumption causes water scarcity to generate concerns related to food security nutrition and livelihoods of various populations in addition to socioeconomic aspects due to the jobs generated in the sector 43 . The use of treated domestic sewage for agriculture can represent a source of greater conﬁdence in water supply as well as improving the efﬁ- ciency of the use of this resource. These practice has been adopted in several countries i.e. Tunisia where the use of treated sewage for agriculture involves 20 of the produced efﬂuents which allows allocating of freshwater for drinking uses and minimizes the release of efﬂuent into the water bodies 48 . In Israel in 2010 38 of agricultural demand was supplied by this source being esti- mated 62 by 2050 49 . This means a target that foresees an in- crease in the use of treated sewage in agriculture from 400 million m3 to 900 million m3 per year. The European Union is concerned about water scarcity on the continent and recently approved new rules to promote the reuse of water in agriculture an activity that consumes 51 of the water on the continent 50 . The proposal will allow an increase in water reuse from 1.7 billion m3 per year to 6.6 billion m3 per year 50 . In Australia it is estimated that in 2015e2016 137 000 ML of the water consumed in agriculture came from the reuse from sources outside the farms 51 . However this volume represents only 1.4 of the total consumed in agriculture in this country. The main ones supply sources are surface water and groundwater. Despite the evident advantages of water reuse there are limi- tations related to the treatment of efﬂuents such as the health risks and public acceptance. In order for the beneﬁts of water reuse to be fully enjoyed it is necessary that the practice be critically accepted considering the risks involved and the challenges presented in the deﬁnition of regulations for each speciﬁc activity. However it is also required that the evaluation be carried out in a broader and holistic approach in the context of circular economy of water management 52 . 2.2. Resource recovery a new green-bioeconomy From the context of the circular and green economy resource recovery is an interesting option to obtain value from a waste 53 . Resource recovery can represent the new concept of green bio- economy englobing visions of circular ﬁnite renewable and sus- tainable resources Fig. 2 . Besides this another relevant factor is Fig. 1. Global CO2 emissions by countries. Adapted from Ref. 34 . H. Vieira de Mendonça P. Assemany M. Abreu et al. Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 844 the negative environmental impact of the various resource pro- duction chain. For instance in the industry of fertilizer the total energy consumption for the production of potash phosphate and ammonia fertilizers is 13 800 kJ kg 1 17 500 kJ kg 1 and 78 239 kJ kg 1 respectively 54 . The Haber Bosch process for ammonia production is responsible for 1e2 of global energy consumption and 1.44 of global CO2 emissions 55 . Regarding phosphorus it is estimated that apatite its ﬁnite source to be depleted in 50e100 years 56 or in 100e400 years if technical advancements and the exploitation of new rocks are considered 57 . Oil is another example of ﬁnite resource utilized as a feedstock for the production of different products. The world s oil consump- tion in 2018 was 99.8 million barrels per day representing 1.5 of growth rate per annum 58 . Conventional power stations based in oil coal or natural gas are responsible for emitting 344e941 kg CO2 MWh 1 at capacities of 400e1200 MW 59 . Some industrial sectors have successful resource recovery ex- amples such as the traditional petrochemical industry and the dairy process industry. In the petrochemical industry the recovery of waste heat has been applied for many years 60 61 . On the other hand the resource recovery in the dairy industry is a more recent subject. The high valuable product whey protein powder is pro- duced through a membrane module used to separate different portions of the milk waste 53 . Wastewater can be considered a problem that may cause several negative impacts in the environment if not properly treated as seen in Section 1.3 . However wastewater can also be considered as a resource. The energy content of wastewater is estimated to be 6.3 kJ L 1 related to the chemical oxygen demand 62 . Wastewater sludge accumulates 98 of the ingested phosphorus 63 and approximately 20 of global phosphorus demand can be satisﬁed by recovering 3 million metric t per year of this nutrient from hu- man waste 64 . Therefore wastewater represents a resource to be recovered rich in energy and very important from a circular economy perspective. In the USA the wastewater treatment plants WWTPs are responsible for 3 of national electricity consumption 65 . Secondary and tertiary treatments are energy-intense ranging from 0.3 to 2.1 and 0.4e3.8 kWh m 3 respectively in developed countries 66 . The major negative impact of a conventional WWTP operation is the emissions of GHG 67e69 . According to the USA Environmental Protection Agency EPA in 2017 14.2 and 5.0 MMT CO2eq of CH4 and N2O respectively were emitted during the sludge digestion in this sector 70 . As the demand and costs for energy and water keep increasing the vision toward wastewater treatment is changing. The linear end of pipe approach of WWTPs no longer meets the sustainability requirements of current society and municipal wastewater is being considered as a valuable resource creating the water resource recovery facilities WRRFs 53 instead of aligned with the circular economy green. In this context advantages such as reduction of feedstock depletion and GHG emissions can be achieved through resource recovery from the efﬂuent producing energy and reducing energy needs 53 . Besides sustainability appeal the economic point of view is also an advantage of this approach because it allows adding economic value to waste making the process economically attractive in addition to being environmentally necessary. Waste from WWTPs contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that can be recovered and used as fertilizers 71 . On the organic matter can also be obtained energy and heat through biochemical thermal and chemical conversion processes. In addition it is possible to get different types of biopolymers 72 metals 73 and cellulose 74 from the wastewater. 2.3. Microalgae ﬁghting the overcontamination 2.3.1. Microalgae for GHG ﬁxation Microalgae have been studied as feedstock for different pur- poses such as bioenergy production 75e77 soil conditioner and biofertilizer 78 and the source of protein for food and feed pro- duction 79 80 . These varieties of products can be obtained due to microalgae s ability to produce different compounds from their metabolism allowing to meet the many demands of current society 4 . These microorganisms present a major biomass yield and Fig. 2. Resource recovery in a circular and green bioeconomy context. H. Vieira de Mendonça P. Assemany M. Abreu et al. Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 845 photosynthetic rate compared to higher plants and be grown throughout the year in areas unsuitable for agriculture 9 . Due to these reasons microalgae are quoted not only for eco- nomic and social purposes but also to become an important solu- tion to environmental so necessary and urgent. The microalgae photosynthetic efﬁciency in crops supplemented with CO2 can be up to 8.3 while the photosynthetic efﬁciency of terrestrial plant species is estimated at 4.6 6 . Microalgae have the capacity to remove 10 to 50 times more CO2 than terrestrial plants due to the higher concentration of chlorophyll per unit area 81 . Through autotrophic growth approximately 1.83 kg of CO2 are ﬁxed for each 1 kg of algal biomass 82 . Despite the ability of microalgae to assimilate CO2 from the at- mosphere its low concentration added to the low mass transfer coefﬁcient between the air and the surface of the culture medium make carbon a limiting nutrient for biomass growth 83 therefore the supplementation with inorganic carbon can increase the biomass production. De Godos et al. 84 evaluated the effect of CO2 addition during biomass cultivation in swine efﬂuent in high rate algal ponds HRAP . The addition of gas with 7.5 CO2 provided a biomass production of 422 mg VSS L 1 while the control treatment without the addition of CO2 allow obtaining 297 mg VSS L 1. The authors pointed out that the assimilation of CO2 in microalgae growth is dependent on the limitation of inorganic carbon which in turn is more evident in conditions of greater radiation and temperature because favor the photosynthesis. Posadas et al. 85 evaluated the CO2 incorporation in microalgae cultivation in pri- mary domestic sewage through HRAP system. It was obtained a biomass productivity of 17 g m 2 d 1 with the addition of pure CO2 99.9 while in the cultivation without extra CO2 addition was obtained a productivity of 5 g m 2 d 1. Given that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere varies from 0.03 to 0.06 the use of atmospheric emissions from industrial processes may represent an alternative source of CO2 for the cultivation of microalgae. This practice is directly related to the concept of circular bioeconomy since it uses waste in a subsequent process minimizing the emission of pollutants and contributing to reducing costs. Low-cost sources of CO2 such as furnaces power plants and ﬂue gases from boilers can be used to feed a microalgae systems 86 87 reducing the CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. This is yet another economic and sustainable advantage of the microalgae cultivation. The biochemical composition of microalgae and consequently their ﬁnal utilization for the most diverse options uses is strongly affected by the CO2 source origin quantity and quality. Most microalgae perform well under high CO2 concentra- tions such as 15 CO2 which is the typical concentration of the industrial chimney exhaust ﬂue gases considering the NOx and SOx 88 . Even richer CO2 environments up to 50 CO2 offer also conditions for CO2 ﬁxing through microalgae as previously re- ported by Sung et al. 89 . Table 1 presents examples of studies that evaluated alternative sources of CO2 in microalgae cultivation. The addition of emission gases must be carried out with adequate control. Emissions from industrial activities can contain pollutants that can be toxic and negatively affect the growth of microalgae. SO2 hydrolyzed in water leads to the formation of hydrogen ions reducing pH which impairs the growth of micro- algae 97 . Chiu et al. 95 studied the production of Chlorella during the constant addition of ﬂue gases from the coke oven. The authors observed that the cultivation obtained a biomass concentration of 2.87 g L 1 and also contributed to the removal of SOx and NOx by 50 and 70 respectively using concentrations of 78 ppm NO and 87 ppm SO2. Radmann et al. 93 evaluated the growth of different species of microalgae under the addition of gases emitted by thermoelectric plants with 60 ppm SO2 and 100 ppm of NO. The microalgae Spirulina sp. and C. vulgaris reached concentrations of 1.59 and 0.98 g L 1 respectively. The species S. obliquus reached 0.68 g L 1 while S. nidulans obtained 0.41 g L 1. Despite the microalgae capacity to assimilate CO2 and the use of atmospheric emissions as potential sources of this gas this does not mean a reduction in emissions. The CO2 used will be converted into organic carbon in the microalgae cells. As soon as this biomass is used the organic matter will be degraded and the CO2 emission will occur. However microalgae can be a feedstock for biofuels pro- duction and other products in the most sustainable way mini- mizing fossil fuel use 83 . In summary the use of microalgae compared to conventional methods of gaseous efﬂuents treatment can have the double beneﬁt of reducing ﬂue gas toxicity and the generation of biofuel and bioreﬁnery byproducts 98 applied in the concept of circular bioeconomy. 2.3.2. Microalgae for wastewater treatment Environmental beneﬁts from microalgae utilization go beyond GHG assimilation. Koller et al. 99 state the possibility of mixo- trophic microalgae cultivation combining removal of pollutants from wastewater in a heterotrophic phase assimilation of soluble organic carbon and generation of high added value products in an autotrophic phase assimilation of inorganic carbon - CO2 . Ac- cording to Molinuevo-Salces et al. 100 the supply of nutrients is one of the main barriers for microalgae cultivation on a full scale. The use of wastewater nutrients can be a strategy that contribute for both bioremediation and the ﬁnal treatment of wastewater 101 . These microorganisms are capable of developing in efﬂuents with different compositions since they can assimilate the nutrients Table 1 Results and characteristics of the studies on atmospheric emissions utilization as a CO2 source for microalgae cultivation.

Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 846 present in wastewater. After the separation of the biomass the efﬂuent is puriﬁed and can be released into receiving watercourses or reused into other activities see Section 2.1 . In this context re- actors utilized at the production of biomass from wastewater treatment have been evaluated and improved such as tubular photobioreactors 102 ﬂat-plat 11 bubble columns 12 and attached growth systems 103 . Considering the context of a WWTP the HRAPs are the reactors with more consistent results on a large scale 10 . Table 2 presents various studies that explore microalgae potential for wastewater treatment. HRAPs are open reactors and present much more advantages over conventional pond systems. Its operation occurs through the continuous mixing of the efﬂuent by paddlewheels. Moreover they are operated through the establishment of a microorganism con- sortium mainly microalgae and bacteria based on the establish- ment of the symbiotic relationship between them 104 . Through photosynthesis microalgae produce dissolved oxygen DO that is consumed by heterotrophic bacteria in the process of organic matter degradation from the efﬂuent. This process consequently releases CO2 that is used by microalgae in their autotrophic meta- bolism. Besides the action of heterotrophic bacteria at night some microalgae exercise breathing contributing to the degradation of organic matter 110e114 . The removal of nitrogen in microalgae-based wastewater sys- tems is directly dependent on the organism s metabolism. Photo- synthetic activity will increase the pH which in turn interferes with the volatilization of ammonia nitrogen due to the higher fraction of NH3. In addition the production of oxygen may enable the development of nitrifying bacteria in the consortium of microor- ganisms with the conversion of ammonia nitrogen to nitrite and later to nitrate. This conversion implies a transformation of the nitrogen forms but not the removal itself. Another possibility for the removal of nitrogen is the assimilation of inorganic forms such as ammonium nitrite and nitrate throughout the growth of biomass. Ammonia nitrogen is the primary source of assimilation because it occurs through passive diffusion increasing propor- tionally the absorption rate with the concentration of the substrate 105 . On the other hand the assimilation of nitrate has a maximum level with an increase in the concentration of the nutrient. How- ever nitrate provides an extension of the exponential growth phase through the surplus metabolic capacity in the amino acid synthesis 105 . Couto et al. 106 evaluated the mechanisms of nitrogen removal in HRAP treating UASB reactor efﬂuent being found that nitriﬁcation and assimilation by biomass were the main forms of nitrogen transformation removal. Gonzalez-Fern andez et al. 107 discovered that nitriﬁcation was the main process for NeNH4þ transformation during the cultivation of microalgae in anaerobic efﬂuent. Since this efﬂuent is composed of non-easily biodegradable organic matter the available DO was primarily used in nitriﬁcation rather than in the degradation of organic matter. The removal mechanisms are directly related with the recovery of nutrient resources in the efﬂuents. The removal by volatilization for example may allow reaching the regulation standards how- ever without allowing the use of the nutrient in another produc- tion cycle. Thus strategies of system control i.e. CO2 Table 2 Microalgae potential for wastewater treatment.

H. Vieira de Mendonça P. Assemany M. Abreu et al. Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 847 supplementation through pH control to minimize nitrogen loss through volatilization can increase the possibility of recovering this resource. Phosphorus removal will occur by chemical precipitation with high pH values or by biomass assimilation. Similarly to the nitro- gen pH control can assist in the higher rate of phosphorus assim- ilation by biomass and consequently allow the recovery of this nutrient. Phosphorus participates in the transfer of intracellular energy and nucleic acid synthesis in addition to the cell division reactions 105 being a fundamental nutrient for cell growth. There are various studies that reporting a high efﬁciency of P removal via biocapture using microalgae grown in domestic 115e117 indus- trial 118 or agro-industrial 11 119 wastewaters. However phosphorus removal in algal systems may be often difﬁcult as could be observed in Table 2 with most results inferiors to 35 of removal efﬁciency. Algal bioﬁlm reactor that presented a P removal of 93 was one of the exceptions explained by algal bioﬁlm P assimilation as pH did not exceed the 7 value 111 . On the other hand Assis et al. 103 studied domestic sewage treatment through a hybrid algae system composed of a HRAP and a bioﬁlm reactor observed 21 and 25 removals of soluble phosphorus in systems with and without CO2 supplementation respectively. These results may indicate that even algae attached growth systems may have limitations for P removal mainly those related with the lowest amount of P necessary for the cellular composition of microalgae. P luxury uptake is an alternative to increase P removal via assimila- tion and can lead to an increase in cell P content up to 4e6 DW when in normal conditions P content is about 1 120 . In view of the concern with the mineral reserves of phosphorus previously mentioned in Section 2.2 microalgae can be a tool for the recovery of this nutrient in several efﬂuents. In addition to nutrient removal the inactivation of pathogenic organisms can be obtained through microalgae growth systems. Photosynthetic activity will raise the pH and DO concentrations and these factors can act synergistically for the occurrence of microor- ganisms photo-oxidation 121 . The surface area volume ratio is a design parameter for wastewater treatment and microalgae culti- vation directly related with the inactivation efﬁciency of patho- genic bacteria. In theory the greater this parameter the greater the exposure of the culture medium to solar radiation the greater the photosynthetic activity and consequently the greater the efﬁciency of inactivation. Craggs et al. 122 evaluated HRAPs with 30 cm and 45 cm deep with different surface areas and with the same volume achieved better disinfection efﬁciency for HRAP with the greater area and less depth. Rich DO environments together with intense radiation can provide the formation of atomic oxygen and or su- peroxide oxygen that cause irreversible damage to the microor- ganism s DNA 123 . Ansa et al. 121 evaluated the effect of algal biomass in the removal of total coliforms in domestic sewage verifying that in the absence of light the decay was greater with an increase in chlorophyll-a concentrations may have been the reason the release of substances by microalgae which have a biocidal effect and act in the inactivation of coliforms. Molina- C ardenas et al. 124 observed that in a batch culture the concen- trations of bacteria were reduced to undetectable levels in 2e7 days due to microalgae I. galbana synthesis of antibacterial fatty acids that inhibit the development of pathogenic bacteria. Currently there is a concern with the presence of several emerging microcontaminants like those in medicines pesticides and endocrine disruptors that are accumulated in the wastewater. These compounds are persistent and can lead to bioaccumulation 125 . Some studies indicated the possibility of removing these compounds in microalgae cultivation systems. Vassalle et al. 126 investigated the removal of microcontaminants in HRAP and showed 64 e70 of removal efﬁciencies for drugs such as ibuprofen diclofenac naproxen and paracetamol. The study also reported efﬁciencies of 90e95 in removing estrogens. Results may be justiﬁed due to the processes of direct photodegradation bio- adsorption and biodegradation. Abargues et al. 125 showed that the treatment with oxygen supersaturation via microalgae photo- synthesis presented a higher degradation rate of endocrine dis- ruptors when compared with the treatments without microalgae. Another group of interest in the wastewater treatment is the trace metals. As they are not biodegradable similarly to emerging microcontaminants the trace metals persist in the environment also leading to bioaccumulation in the food chain which can trigger critical environmental and health problems 127 . Molazadeh et al. 128 evaluated the Pb removal by Chaetoceros sp. and Chlorella sp. and obtained removal efﬁciencies of 60 and 78 respectively. The authors point out that efﬁciency will be dependent on parameters such as pH temperature and contact time. The presence of trace metals in algal biomass can represent a challenge for its later use. Leong and Chang 129 highlighted the necessity of techniques development for biomass pretreatment with the objective to recover metals as a strategy to overcome this bottleneck. 3. Microalgae the green treasure bio-based products and biofuels Microalgae are a promising green feedstock for several products i.e. animal nutrition bioplastics bioinks biofertilizer biofuels and bioenergy 130 Fig. 3 . Regarding bioenergy various biofuels can be produced from algal biomass such as methane syngas hydrogen ethanol bio- diesel jet fuel bio-char bio-oil among others 5 131 Fig. 4 . Ac- cording to Medeiros et al. 87 biofuels based on microalgae biomass may have a crucial role in bioenergy production in the future. Microalgae biodiesel production is justiﬁed by the ability of some species to accumulate high concentrations of lipids 132 . Chlorella and Scenedesmus strains were reported to accumulate 30.3 and 35.7 of lipids dry base in its composition 133 . In comparison with oilseeds commonly used for this purpose microalgae have several advantages such as not requiring agricul- tural areas for its production and can be cultivated throughout the year. Productivity per unit area can reach up to 10 000 L ha 1 year 1 of biodiesel 134 being by far higher than the capacity that pre- sents other oil sources such as sunﬂower canola soy Jatropha palm among others 5 Table 3 . Moreover compared with other biofuels biodiesel can be an immediate and applicable alternative for fossil-based diesel. However the lipid content stored in the microalgae cells can vary greatly between different species and even in the same spe- cies depending on the culture conditions. Many different key conditions for high lipid accumulation in microalgae are studied in the literature. Generally nutrient deprivation conditions lead to a greater accumulation of lipids by microalgae such as the limitation of nitrogen and phosphorus 138e140 . Other conditions i.e. stress from cadmium iron and salinity contents light intensity and the silica concentration in the last case of marine diatoms 139 141 also inﬂuence biomass growth and consequently it is a process lipid accumulation with a high energy-intensive. Among nutrient starvation tests N P and Fe Srinuanpan et al. 142 concluded that N starvation was the most efﬁcient in increasing lipid content just like its saturation level in biomasses S. obliquus and M. reisseri. Usual steps for oil obtaining from microalgae can be cited as har- vesting biomass drying and oil extraction. Among them the drying process can be considered a bottleneck since it is a process with a high energy-intensive 143 . Therefore lately biodiesel production from wet microalgae biomass has gained attention 144 . In Table 4 H. Vieira de Mendonça P. Assemany M. Abreu et al. Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 848 successful cases in the production of biomass and lipids were selected through the cultivation of microalgae in synthetic medium and also in several wastewaters. It can be observed that the wastewater is an excellent cultivation medium for dozens of microalgae species. The values recorded using artiﬁcial culture media are comparable to those using wastewater for the growth of species. An important strategy to maximize the production of the lipids in microalgae biomass is the increase of salinity in the culture medium 152 . Most freshwater microalgae can be grown in sa- linities between 2 to 18 ppt 162 . Some marine strains can be successfully grown in salinity ranges between 12 and 40 g L 1 being the optimal range between 20 and 24 g L 1 163 164 . In a study by Salama et al. 165 found that the increase in salinity from 0.43 to 25 mM increased the percentage of lipids in the biomass of C. mexicana and S. obliquus from 23 to 37 and 22 e34 respectively. These results showed the importance of salt stress to maximize the lipid percentage in green microalgae cells. Abomohra and Almutairib 166 cultivated Scenedesmus obliquus in anaerobi- cally digested seaweeds Gracilaria multipartita that registered a maximum dry weight of 4.57 g L 1 with 28.8 of total lipids. The study of these authors showed the highest lipid productivity and FAMEs recovery 65.2 mg L 1 d 1 and 123.3 mg g 1 dry weight respectively with enhanced biodiesel characteristics. Another methodology used to maximize biodiesel production from Scenedesmus obliquus biomass was the application of night lighting using monochromatic light-emitting diodes 167 . In this case the growth of microalgae the production of lipids and the recovery of biodiesel increased signiﬁcantly under the combination of blue-red lighting. The average lipid volumetric productivity recorded under the reported conditions was 58.3 mg L 1 d 1 and the total FAME was 147.2 mg g 1 dry weight . Lee et al. 168 investigated the conversion of fats oils and greases FOGs into fatty acid methyl esters FAMEs without pre- treatment. The process was thermally induced to perform the simultaneous esteriﬁcation of free fatty acids FFAs and lipid transesteriﬁcation containing high concentrations of impurities in the biomass z14 wt . The maximum FAMEs yield recorded by the authors was 86 based on the mass of the raw material without removing the impurities. This study proved that this technique can be considered valuable and effective for converting low-quality raw materials contained in FOGs into biodiesel being recommended to maximize processes for obtaining this biofuel. Almarashi et al. 169 used low doses of cold atmospheric- pressure plasma CAPP as pre-treatment of inoculum for cultiva- tion Chlorella vulgaris. The authors reported high performance in the biodiesel recovery. The highest recorded lipid concentration was 20.99 and lipid productivity was 40.7 mg L 1 d 1 when the inoculum was exposed to CAPP for 30 s before cultivation. The maximum FAMEs recovery of 478.7 mg g 1 dry weight was observed at pretreatment for 60 s being considered to the greater recovery in biodiesel in this condition due to plasma stress. The results found by the authors indicate that the recovery of FAMEs as well as the quality of biodiesel were improved by the CAPP treat- ment when compared to other traditional methods. Biodiesel production from microalgae focuses on the use of lipid content. After its extraction the remaining biomass can be used for other purposes meeting the context of circular economy green and increasing the economic value of the biomass. Ma et al. 132 demonstrated that the microalgae residual after wet microalgae Chlorella vulgaris lipid extraction could be used for fermentable sugar production through enzymatic hydrolysis of the carbohy- drate. Assemany et al. 170 evaluated the use of residual biomass after lipid extraction as a substrate in the anaerobic digestion. The results showed a biogas production potential of 2.6 m3 kg VS volatile solids higher than the biogas production from raw biomass. According to the study lipid extraction promoted the disruption of microalgae cells facilitating the degradation of organic matter by anaerobic microorganisms. These results high- light the possibility of synergistic effects between different biofuel production techniques. Biogas is the most promising biofuel that has the potential to mitigate the current negative impacts of fossil fuels utilization mainly energy crisis and climate change 171 . Biogas production occurs through anaerobic digestion performed by a consortium of bacteria and archeas in the biochemical conversion of the organic matter into bioenergy more speciﬁcally CH4 172 . Methane gas can be converted into renewable transportation fuels or into elec- tricity. The digestate comprised of nutrients and water can be reused in other production processes such as algae cultivation or used as a biofertilizer. In the context of bioenergy production from algal biomass and ﬁghting over contamination this process rep- resents an important alternative especially caused for the wet biomass minimizing the costs of harvesting and drying steps. Methane yield from microalgae can vary a lot depending on algae species i.e. from 0.17 m3 kg 1 VS for Chlorella minutissima biomass to 0.54 m3 kg 1 VS for Macrosystis pyrifera brown Fig. 3. Bioproducts and biofuels obtained from wastewater treatment using microalgae. H. Vieira de Mendonça P. Assemany M. Abreu et al. Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 849 macroalgae 173 . But biogas yield from microalgae remains close or higher than the yield of other biomass types such as sugar crops 0.19 m3 kg 1 VS and lignocellulosic biomass 0.17 m3 kg 1 VS 174 . However there are still some key technoeconomic limita- tions particularly the low anaerobic biodegradability and the reduced C N ratio of algal biomass 175 . In this sense pretreatment strategies for cell wall rupture and co-digestion have been widely studied Table 5 . Regarding energetic feasibility anaerobic digestion from microalgae biomass proved to be rentable. Chao Xiao 186 re- ported that all tested methods of biogas production obtained a positive energy gain with net output energy of 1.73 2.37 and 3.11 kWh from the anaerobic processes without pretreatment and with hydrothermal pretreament moved without and with solar- driven respectively. When using the co-digestion strategy net energy production was 3.2 GJ per day versus 1.6 GJ per day for microalgae mono-digestion indicating a generation of 2.7 and 4.5 fold the energy consumed. If this potential energy would be transformed into electricity via cogeneration 151 and 307 kWh per day could be provided by the mono and co-digestion process respectively 177 . Vassalle et al. 183 also obtained a positive net energy ratio of 2.8 through co-digesting microalgae biomass and domestic sewage in a UASB reactor that represented a 180 energy gain in relation to the consumption. This energy gain was 5 times greater when compared to the sewage mono-digestion. Hydrothermal liquefaction HTL is a thermochemical process of organic matter conversion under subcritical conditions of tem- perature and pressure. Four different products are generated from biomass conversions such as the bio-oil gas solid waste and water-soluble compounds. Due to severe operating conditions the entire organic fraction is degraded and bio-oil is not only produced from the lipid content but also from carbohydrates and proteins 4 . Moreover HTL occurs in aqueous media avoiding energy Fig. 4. Routes for converting microalgae biomass into biofuels. Table 3 Comparison of some sources of biodiesel terrestrial crops vs microalgae 82 135e137 .

Vieira de Mendonça P. Assemany M. Abreu et al. Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 850 requirement for biomass drying. These characteristics make HTL an attractive technology that may overcome some bottlenecks asso- ciated with biofuels production from microalgae biomass espe- cially the wastewater grown microalgae biomass with low lipid content. HTL s bio-oil yield is related with the operational condi- tions such as temperature reaction time water ratio in the biomass pressure and the presence of catalysts. Table 6 shows some examples of HTL process using microalgae biomass. HTL can be inserted in a circular bioeconomy context through the valorization of its by-products. The gases generated are mostly composed of CO2 which can be used in microalgae cultivation 7 or like additive in the materials utilized in the construction sector. Solid wastes due to their majority constitution of ashes can be destined to asphalt pavement 187 . Water-soluble products on the other hand are composed of organic acids and nutrients that can again be used in other microalgae cultivation 188 189 or even as a substrate for anaerobic digestion 190 191 . However the aqueous phase has compounds that can be toxic to the microorganisms such as aromatic compounds and metals 192 . Thus its use should be evaluated based on dilutions that do not cause inhibitory effects on microalgae growth. Although HTL is an attractive process for bio-oil obtention through algal biomass conversion regarding resource recovery in the context of a circular economy there are still challenges to be faced. Some main points are the high N content in bio-oil due to the composition of biomass 75 the presence of ash especially when the biomass comes from wastewater 193 the expansion of the scale of reactors and its continuous operation as well as a better understanding of operational parameters such as heating rate initial pressure and particle size 194 . In addition to the processes presented in Fig. 4 lipid conversion into supercritical ﬂuids SFE as presented in Table 7 can have advantages over conventional processes 2 . SFE makes use of high pressures and temperatures in a ﬂuid to break cells without addi- tional chemical reagents or minimizing their use . This method has been proven to be extremely time-efﬁcient with high yields 203 enabling fast conversion of lipids into biodiesel 20 and 60 min whereas solvent extraction can take up to 24 h. Another advantage of the method is that the use of a catalyst can be avoided elimi- nating the production of pollutants. Higher temperature and pressure combined with the effect of the supercritical solvent break the cell walls and facilitate the diffusion of the solvent in the cell matrices with a much higher degree of efﬁciency than con- ventional 2 204 . On the other hand the main disadvantage of SFE is the greater capital necessary including the operational cost due to high temperatures and pressure requirements 204 .

Think global act local how microalgae can ﬁt in Think global and act local is a slogan initially develop in Rio Earth Summit the second Conference of the United Nations held in Rio de Janeiro Brazil in 1992 that culminated with the creation of Agenda 21. This document is an instrument of participatory plan- ning in which the responsibility of governments to promote envi- ronmental programs and projects is explicitly accepted through policies aimed at social justice and the preservation of the envi- ronment 214 . Agenda 21 has a hierarchical spatial scale strategy based on sub-global national and locally settled plans - Local Agenda 21 214 .

Abreu et al. Renewable Energy 165 2021 842e862 852 and environmental. Think global act local is often used to support small im- provements on current environmental sustainability practice. However a systemic change is highly required in order to meet the scale of the challenges at neighborhood city regional national and worldwide levels 216 . In addition progress should be measured in sustainability and should be within environmental limits of the planet as humankind are on a path to overcome them 216 . Sus- tainability has three main pillars - environment society and economy. On a small scale thinking about eco-cities there are some challenges to be included in a sustainability local environ- ment which can broader positive impact in the frontiers and microalgae can ﬁt in many of them. A city can be sustainable based on how technologies and policies are mobilized to enhance energy water healthcare mobility security economic development and community engagement 217 . Transportation is a major concern in urban environments related with air pollution and GHG emissions however the microalgae can be a sustainable option for biofuel production. Public and collective transport can be moved with green fuel such as biodiesel 218 219 and biogas 180 182 from algae biomass see Section 2.3.3 for more detailed examples . Moreover thermal en- ergy for house heating can also be obtained contributing to affordable and safe housing. Residual biomass can in addition serve as raw material for construction materials helping to save resources and to build environmentally friendly buildings. Irfan et al. 220 studied how to optimize bio-cement production using Chlorella kessleri microalgae as a source of calcium through a waste feedstock from cement kiln dust. According to the authors the study of microalga role in the production of bio-cement can result in the readiness of this process in civil construction besides helping in the environmental pollution mitigation by waste utilization. In line with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 the promotion of recycling and resource conservation is among the best practices to be included in helping reducing pollution. This involves more efﬁcient use of re- sources and even signiﬁcantly reduction in resource consumption. Besides achieving zero waste there is a need to change consumer choices and production relationships throughout the supply chain which theoretically will become more localized and regionalized 216 . With multiple use characteristics algae biomass may support resource recovery especially avoiding the generation of waste during wastewater treatment. Nutrient-rich algae biomass may have various utilities such as being a feedstock for a bio-based economy i.e. in the production of bioplastics. Rocha et al. 221 studied the potential of bioplastics production from microalgae consortium from wastewater concluded that despite promising result had been achieved large-scale microalgae biomass should be better development. Moreover the mechanical properties of this type of bioplastics deserves improvement as it limits the product application compared with other available bioplastic options. Ac- cording to the authors further strategies such as composites and crosslinking should be addressed. Regarding wastewater treatment microalgae when used play an important role in recovering river water quality and enhancing whole urban ecosystems to provide a healthy place for fauna ﬂora and people co-existence. Several studies cover the wastewater treatment using microalgae i.e. treatment of domestic sewage 90 115 agro-industrial efﬂuents 11 111 222 and industrial efﬂuent 12 118 see Section 2.3.2 for more detail. Recovered rivers are integrated in the city landscape supporting the health and leisure of urban populations while promoting a deeper connection with nature. Restoration initiatives for damage environments as well as support for local agriculture urban greening and commu- nity gardening are other of the characteristics of an eco-city 223 224 . In terms of food systems Moloney 216 stated that people should understand and direct experience food growing in order to obtain a low impact or even zero carbon food. Microalgae biomass will increasingly help to move beyond zero carbon emissions in line with ecologically sound economic activities. In the context of organic and local agriculture the kind of soil fertilizing is of great importance and that s where among others microalgae biomass can ﬁt in. Nutrient-rich microalgae biomass may be a sustainable source of biofertilizer helping to reduce the environmental impact of the traditional fertilizers production process and to economize resources. Studies have proved the beneﬁts of using microalgae as a biofertilizer 225 for soil fertility improvement and plant growth when used as a source of nitrogen 78 or together with triple su- perphosphate in order to create an environmentally friendly fer- tilizer 226 . Moreover grain yield and fruit quality and nutritional characteristics were improved 227 and heterotrophic activity of the soil besides bacterial growth were stimulated using Chlorella sp. suspension 228 . Another possibility is to use microalgae as a source of protein in the human or animal diet considering that microalgae cultivation is less impactful than the cultivation of terrestrial plants mainly with regard to soil change and conse- quently GHG emissions. Lamminen et al. 229 studied microalgae as a source of protein supplement in the lactating dairy cows nutrition and their results suggested the suitability of non-defatted and protein-rich microalgae compared to soya bean protein meal. Favorable results were found in milk fat concentration when Spir- ulina was used while Nannochloropsis offered a most suitable omega-6 omega-3 ratio for human nutrition. However the authors highlighted poorer palatability of microalgae concentrates. Table 7 Microalgae biomass conversion by supercritical processes.

Microalgal bioreﬁneries all over the world Currently exist an increasing worldwide interest in microalgae crops. This factor is manifested in several areas such as bioenergy for the production of biofuels green crude oil gasoline biodiesel jet fuel bio-oil ethanol biogas syngas methane among others in the capture and sequestration of CO2 from several industrial ap- plications like power plant fermentation plants cement producers and others for wastewater puriﬁcation production of a wide di- versity of products like food supplements including feed and pet foods cosmeceuticals pharmaceuticals biologicals chemicals biochemicals biomaterials among others. Table 8 lists some companies that produce different products from algae biomass with a signiﬁcant scale under an integrated strategy in the frame of bioreﬁneries. The list is ordered by conti- nent and country. 6. Market Current microalgal commercial producers Worldwide there are many companies that produce microalgae for the development of the research area including the study of new species as raw material to produce a variety of products or to be sold to other companies. At a global level the continents that show the greatest evolution in this matter are America mainly the United States of America and Europe being Portugal a strong player in this sector. Every year approximately 7 000 t of dry algae are produced all over the world being the global market of algae biomass can be estimated at USD 3.8 to 5.4 billion 231 . These numbers reﬂect that the microalgae industry is gaining global attention and can be widely utilized in different industrial sectors in the future 232 . Table 9 shows 146 companies or organizations that produce a variety of algae-based products or that sell several species. This information is important to verify the position of the microalgae s in the market worldwide. The mention of government institutions and universities that develop projects in this sector is above the scope of this publication it is known that they exist in many countries of the world betting on microalgae as an alternative fuel in the transport sector as a solution to reduce GHG and to meet future food and feed needs. The legend of Uses applications column Table 9 is as follows note that not all are applicable for each listed company .

Both Table 8 and Table 9 shows that in Europe Portugal rep- resents one of the countries with the greatest development in the areas of microalgae including the bioreﬁneries implementation since the edaphoclimatic conditions help in this process. Portugal is the country in Europe with the highest solar radiation the main source of raw material for microalgae. Several CO2 production focus can also be identiﬁed that help in the implementation of a micro- algae production system through the capture of CO2 essentially from exhaust gases of several industrial units.

The study entitled Evaluation of the Potential of Biomass to Energy in Portugal - Conclusions from the CONVERTE Project demonstrated that there are 29 395 ha with potential for the production of microalgae these areas being speciﬁcally localized in mainland Portugal 241 . Considering again Tables 8 and 9 can be conﬁrmed that with base the wide climatic diversity presented in the USA this is the country has most invested in the installation development and implementation of industrial units in the American continent. Some of them are for the production of biofuels e.g. biodiesel bioethanol jet fuel green crude oil gasoline among others from microalgae just like in other varieties of products in order to protect and assure several commercial sectors. Among these are the nutraceuticals food and feed fertilizers production wastewater treatment CO2 sequestration algae oil and compounds extraction health care cosmeceuticals and pharmaceutical products units for the bioreactors production bioplastics biostimulants natural pig- ments among others. Lastly Table 9 shows that on the Asian continent the countries that represent the largest investment in the microalgae sector are India and Israel being once more fundamental the Region s climate main responsible for the development of microalgae. In India the only microalgae sectors that are not yet developed are health care pharmaceutical beauty care and bioproducts biomaterials pro- duction including in the Israel case . It is important to refer that we believe that exist more micro- algae industrial installations in several countries however the Table 9 represents a large compilation of these industries type around the world. 7. Conclusions As described in detail along the text microalgal biotechnology can be widely regarded as a solution to solve humanity s several challenges regarding environmental problems. However despite the commercialization of microalgae has been a reality in the last decades still high costs of production have directed ﬁnal uses mostly to high-added-value products and niche markets. There- fore as highlights of this review can be concluded The utilization of residues waste resources opens a window of opportunity that shouldn t be neglected in order to improve the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the microalgae mass production especially in what concerns biofuels production The integration of residues wastes treatment with concomitant microalgae production can address the issues of both energy sustainability and waste recycling in the frame of the circular bioeconomy lowering microalgal production costs related with bioenergy and biofuel prices and competitiveness Concepts of circular economy aimed at waste minimization or even elimination and bioeconomy in which residues wastes are used as feedstocks for bio-based products biomaterials and biofuels replacing fossil-based feedstocks must increasingly be considered. Thus the sustainability issues environmental social and economic are addressed together Residues wastes-based bioreﬁneries involving microalgae are expected to fulﬁll an important part of the increasing demand for energy fuels chemicals and materials worldwide ideally towards de zero waste discharge concept Microalgae products may cover a range from low volume and high beneﬁt specialties to high volume and low-cost goods such as biofuels. This review compiled the modern challenges affecting the planet and how microalgae are expected to solve them. Although the future for microalgae applications derived from waste treat- ment seems to be promising a long way still needs to be paved in order to be an important part of the modern industry. More research efforts and investments in different ﬁelds of knowledge are required from the biological biochemical and engineering perspectives among others. The proactive collaboration and engagement of different drivers such as technologists economists engineers entrepreneurs and politicians are expected to be crucial to pushing forward microalgae-based businesses towards an increasingly greener society.

In recent years scientific productiveness associated with microalgae-based studies has elaborated in multiplied aspects while translation to the commercial level continues to be missing. The present microalgal biorefinery has a challenge in long-term viability due to escalated market price of algal-mediated biofuels and bioproducts. Advance- ments are required in a few aspects like improvement in algae processing energy investment and cost analysis of microalgae biorefinery. Therefore it is essential to recognize the modern work by understanding the knowledge gaps and hotspots driv- ing business scale up. The microalgae biorefinery integrated with energy-based products bioactive and green compounds focusing on a circular bioeconomy is urgently needed. A detailed investigation of techno-economic analysis TEA and life cycle assessment LCA is important to increase the market value of algal products. This review discusses the valorization of algal biomass for the value-added application that holds a sustainable approach and cost-competitive algal biorefinery. The current industries policies technology transfer trends challenges and future economic outlook are discussed. This study is an overview through scientometric investigation attempt to describe the research development contributing to this rising field. Keywords Algae Biofuel Bio-products Techno-economic analysis Life cycle analysis Policies Patents Introduction Algae-based biofuel is the perceived solution especially for problems like global warming pollution and high energy demand in developing countries. The terrestrial plants fix 3 6 CO2 per annum whereas around 40 CO2 is fixed by microalgae macroalgae cyanobacteria and seagrass Fabris et al. 2020 Ansari et al. 2019 . Algae are putative source of inexhaustible fuel that can replace fossil fuels. Nevertheless algae fuel production is not yet economically viable hence attention is being diverted towards algal biorefinery concept. Algal biorefinery has numerous environmental benefits like CO2 fixation wastewater treatment along with industrial applications like the production of biofuel biomethane biohydrogen biodiesel bioethanol carbohydrates lipids pigments proteins and biochar Dolganyuk et al. 2020 Özçimen et al. 2015 . Algal biomass is used as food sup- plements and animal feed because of enhanced proteins and lipids Singh et al. 2020 Barros et al. 2015 . The biorefinery approach comprises distinct steps cultivation harvesting cell disruption extraction purification efficient assessment and related policies Kannah et al. 2021 . Extensive exami- nation is required on each step to attain efficient and sus- tainable algae biorefinery approach. Algal biorefinery is an integrated circular bioeconomical approach that encourages zero waste management with self-sustainability hence it can be considered a green-based technology Vasistha et al. 2021a b . LCA and TEA are significant aspects to be discussed in algal biorefinery that include assessing CO2 emission cost analysis and energy consumption in biofuel production Yadav et al. 2019 Mälkki and Alanne 2017 . The crucial parameters including technology advancement economic efficacy environmental sustainability policy framework and industrial awareness need to be focused on making microal- gae value-added products commercially viable. Monika Prakash Rai 1 Amity Institute of Biotechnology Amity University Uttar Pradesh Sector 125 Noida Uttar Pradesh 201313 India 2 International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ICGEB New Delhi 110067 India 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 244 Page 2 of 25 In literature various studies discussed microalgae biore- finery pathways distinct software for LCA and TEA evalu- ation production of value-added bio-products. Saral et al. 2022 reported the different pathways of algae biorefinery with their economic and environmental investigation by LCA and TEA however did not discuss the impact of path- ways on market policies and technology transfer Saral et al. 2022 . Banu et al. 2020 majorly focuses on algal biorefin- ery frameworks market analysis and LCA but significance of value-added products and TEA is lacking. Kannah et al. 2021 elucidated the biochemical conversion of algal biore- finery with other aspects such as LCA TEA and value- added products but commercialization and current market trends were not discussed Kannah et al. 2021 . Microalgae biorefinery based on bioremediation are widely elaborated by Sharma et al. 2022 however the commercialization of value-added products in the various industrial sector and challenges of microalgae biorefinery from wastewater were missing Sharma et al. 2022 . In contrast our review majorly emphasizes economic and environmental sustainability cur- rent research progress and market analysis in the algal biore- finery field contrary to previous research reporting majorly on processing and environmental aspects of biorefinery. This review focuses on the significance of i integrated approach of algae biorefinery ii self-sustainability and environmen- tal feasibility iii valorization of algae biomass to obtain value-added products iv TEA and LCA for opting suitable strategies v the technology transfer trends and government policies implemented for regulating framework of biofuel market. Outlook of algal biorefinery There are specific acknowledged strategies for cultivation biomass recovery and extraction of value-added products from distinct algal species. The three foremost modes of algae cultivation are photoautotrophic heterotrophic mixo- trophic and photohetrotrophic Vasistha et al. 2021a . How- ever large-scale algae cultivation in open ponds raceways tubular photobioreactors and flat plate photobioreactors are reported Daneshvar et al. 2021 . Various known harvest- ing techniques for algal biomass recovery include manual centrifugation flocculation filtration and floatation. Subse- quently different extraction processes including chemical mechanical physical and enzymatic are applied to har- vested algae biomass to acquire tremendous value-added products Yadav and Rai 2022 . Certain prevalent extraction techniques are transesterification hydrothermal treatment cracking ultrasonic-assisted extraction electroporation iso- tonic extraction and so on Banerjee et al. 2022 . Algae biorefinery is considered a sustainable bio- economic strategy to valorize biomass for industrial applications. Simultaneously producing bioenergy and other value-added co-products such as polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA pigments antioxidants and protein meal are imperative for offsetting the high production cost of algal biofuels Mohan et al. 2020 Arora et al. 2021 . Due to environmental benefits algal biorefinery-based biofuel and value-added products are leading the industry. Oleagi- nous algal biomass is essential to produce biofuels such as biodiesel and other value-added products like PUFA and nutraceuticals Chen and Lee 2019 . The remaining de-oiled algal biomass is a prominent source of carbohydrates pro- teins amino acids pigments and nutrients Fan et al. 2020 . Various processing methods have been explored to treat de- oiled algal biomass based on prerequisite biomass standards processing state and process outcome Chen and Lee 2019 . In a study Scenedesmus Bijugatus grown in a 250 L verti- cal tubular photobioreactor yielded 0.26 g L per day dry weight biomass with 63 mg L per day lipid which was uti- lized to generate 0.21 g biodiesel and 0.158 g ethanol. Here Scenedesmus Bijugatus demonstrated biodiesel production and ethanol biosynthesis to reduce the overall expense of the process Kumar et al. 2019 . In another approach the de-oiled algal biomass or lipid extracted algal hydrochar LEH is further gasified in supercritical water to extract gaseous fuels within the biorefinery. In Nannochloropsis sp. biomass slurry was hydrothermally carbonized HTC to acquire hydrochar with nutrients and small organic com- pounds from the aqueous phase recycled for algal growth. Later supercritical water gasification SCWG of LEH was performed at 600 °C for 6 h resulting in 75 energy recov- ery and absolute retrieval of nitrogen in the form of ammo- nia Lu and Savage 2015 . The minimization of external energy needs water and nutrient demands might be achieved by utilizing a biorefin- ery approach with energy and material symbiosis between unit functions. The integral production of biodiesel biogas and bioethanol from algal biorefinery helps to upgrade the cost-effectiveness of bioenergy generation Singh et al. 2020 Martínez-Gutiérrez 2018 . The strategy of utilizing by-products of biodiesel extraction and purification process combined with different processes and waste materials is considered as a closed-loop approach Gue et al. 2018 . Algae biorefinery is one such closed-loop approach with high economic and environmental sustainability as men- tioned in Fig. 1. A significant reduction in the overall cost of the process was observed when biodiesel and other prod- ucts like bioethanol butanol biochar biogas carbohydrate proteins pigments antioxidants polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA and monounsaturated fatty acids MUFA are also produced. In biodiesel production glycerol is an additional product considered a beneficial growth substrate for culturing ole- aginous microalgae. Various industries accept glycerol as a 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 Page 3 of 25 244 feed and improved fuel additive Gue et al. 2018 . In phar- maceutical and cosmeceutical industries colouring agents nourishments and fragrances are produced by pigments and carotenoids Pierobon et al. 2018 . Global demand for algal carotenoids is increasing rapidly mainly for lutein astaxan- thin and total carotenoids are considered 358 million USD in 2024 814 million USD in 2022 and 1.53 billion respec- tively Kumar et al. 2020a b c Carotenoids market by type 2021 Astaxanthin market by source 2022 . The residual algal biomass left after biodiesel and value-added products extraction is utilized as fertilizers and bioplastic feedstock in the agricultural and bioplastic industry De Corato et al. 2018 . The closed-loop approach makes the algae-mediated biorefinery environment friendly and beneficial from a busi- ness perspective. Another benefit of the closed-loop strategy is the circular economy depicted by LCA and TEA analysis of algae-mediated biofuel production Liu et al. 2019 . Com- paring biodiesel production from microalgae and jatropha in a circular loop approach the material circularity indicator MCI scores high for algae biodiesel Gue et al. 2018 . MCI scores in the above study are based on circularity level GHG emission and indirect product extraction. This approach encourages zero waste management recycling and reuti- lizing by-products as raw material for the next algae cycle making it a self-sustainable concept Hemalatha et al. 2019 . GHG balance of bioenergy generation may get disorganized because of fossil fuel at various stages of the biomass supply chain. Nevertheless it can be sustained by reducing fossil energy utilization by alternatively enhancing waste CO2 and nutrient-laden water streams Yadav et al. 2020 . According to LCA the algal biomass production and drying processes are highly energy-intensive processes con- sidering the comprehensive energy requirement of 54.98 Taelman et al. 2015 . A LCA-oriented study was conducted on Nannochloropsis sp. under 24 different conditions based on cultivation harvesting and lipid extraction techniques. The study reveals that algal biodiesel GHG balance can be enhanced using nutrients from waste and CO2 Monari et al. 2016 . An innovative and tenable concept of the algal biore- finery is the integration of heterotrophically grown algae using wastewater for its remediation and the proper valoriza- tion of de-oiled biomass Mohan et al. 2015 . Encouraging Fig. 1 Schematic representation of algal biorefinery closed-loop approach Mohan et al. 2020 Banu et al. 2020 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 244 Page 4 of 25 wastewater utilization in heterotrophically grown algal bio- mass with appropriate lipid valorization in a closed-loop approach presents novel scope Choudhary et al. 2020 . Astals et al. demonstrated anaerobic co-digestion of algal biomass from Scenedesmus sp. with pig manure to produce biogas proteins and lipids. In the study lipid and protein were extracted from Scenedesmus sp. The biomass remnant was digested with pig manure leading to 29 37 methane yield Astals et al. 2015 . Co-production of algal ethanol and biodiesel is an appro- priate process where dilute acid pre-treatment leads to sequential segregation of lipid and ethanol by distillation and solvent extraction respectively Laurens et al. 2015 . An Integral approach toward processing algal slurry decreases the expense of algal biofuels like fatty acid methyl esters FAMEs and ethanol together by 9 which also leads to a reduced energy outcome of 476.96 LGE t -1 biomass at 2.84 per L Gasoline Equivalent LGE Kumar et al. 2019 . In an integral biorefinery approach β-carotene ω-3 fatty acids biodiesel glycerol and bioethanol were extracted from mixotrophically grown Scenedesmus obliquus through a sequential protocol which resulted in 0.06 g of β-carotene 2 g of ω-3 fatty acids 38 g of biodiesel 3 g of glycerol and 17 g of bioethanol. Hence generating various value- added products from individual feedstock in an integral algal biorefinery approach makes the process sustainable and cost-effective. Comparing the collaborative production of biodiesel bio- hydrogen and biobutanol to individual production concern- ing the processing and maintenance cost the collaborative approach was seen as economically more prominent. The algal bioenergy generation depends on the cost of biomass feedstock Ahorsu et al. 2018 . Various stress-based research shows enhanced yield of biodiesel and value-added products making the algal biorefinery approach a more prominent alternative to fossil fuel. In a study eight integral microal- gae biorefinery frameworks carrying fresh water and marine algae grown in nitrogen-depleted conditions for GHG bal- ance energy consumption and eutrophication potential were studied Kaur et al. 2021 Cheng et al. 2022 . Their effect was examined on biomolecular components which revealed enhanced lipid accumulation under nitrogen-depleted condi- tions Brownbridge et al. 2014 . Marine algal species recycle most nutrients under nitrogen depletion while freshwater species cannot. As a result marine species contribute less to eutrophication than freshwater Brownbridge et al. 2014 . Carbohydrates proteins and lipids from wet algae biomass can be converted into biodiesel bioethanol and alcohols while the de-oiled biomass is a source of monomeric sugars such as glucose galactose and mannose used to synthesize biohydrogen alcohol and bioplastics Khanra et al. 2020a b Trivedi et al. 2015 . Three different methods for algal bio-oil production were compared in a study that concludes that the slow pyrolysis of remaining algal biomass after lipid extraction is beneficial over the slow pyrolysis of fresh dry microalgal biomass Silva et al. 2016a b . Technical advancement and further research are essential to upgrade the sustainability and beneficial aspect of the algal biore- finery strategies for biofuel utilization instead of fossil fuel. Plethora of algal value added products Algae as a promising source of fuel Biodiesel Microalgae can incorporate CO2 during algae photosyn- thesis and convert it into useable molecules for biodiesel production. Hence the CO2 liberated during combustion gets utilized leading to carbon neutral fuel. Due to this environment-friendly quality of algal fuel is considered a highly productive and sustainable energy feedstock Yaşar 2020 . Successful integration of wastewater technology with algae biomass production provides different fatty acids used for biodiesel production Sun et al. 2018 . Removal of intracellular lipid is necessary for obtaining biodiesel from microalgae and the process needs to be energy-efficient for economic biodiesel production Sajid et al. 2016 . Some process gives rise to low-quality biodiesel such as micro- emulsification pyrolysis and catalytic cracking. The process of transesterification is prominently used to convert algal oil to biodiesel where the Triacyl glycerides TAGs react with alcohol in the presence of acid or base catalyst to give fatty acid alkyl esters FAMEs . In the transesterification process unrefined oil reacts with alcohol in the presence of a catalyst resulting in fatty acid methyl ester and glyc- erol as by-products. In microalgae raw and viscous lipids TAGs free fatty acids are transformed into low molecular weight fatty acid alkyl esters Santos-Sánchez et al. 2016 . There are different catalysts used during the transesterifica- tion process a alkaline catalysts like potassium hydroxide sodium hydroxide and sodium methoxide b acid cata- lysts like hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid and sulfonic acid phosphoric acid c enzymatic catalyst like lipases and d inorganic heterogeneous catalyst like solid phase catalyst. The industries consider acid catalysts favorable but alkaline catalysts are 400 times more efficient Tang et al. 2020a b . Algal species mainly studied for biodiesel production are Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella protothecoides because of their excellent biomass and relatively high oil content de Morais et al. 2015 . The factors that influence the transes- terification process are the molar ratio of alcohol to oil type of alcohol type and amount of catalysts reaction time tem- perature and purity of reactants. The most suitable condi- tions for maximum biodiesel production are a 9 1 methanol 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 Page 5 of 25 244 oil molar ratio 1.5 KOH catalyst oil ratio for 10 min Tang et al. 2020a b Zappi et al. 2019 . The lipase enzyme used in enzymatic transesterification is of two kinds intracellular and extracellular Santos-Sánchez et al. 2016 . Lipase being a biocatalyst for the transforma- tion of biodiesel from algae under moderate conditions with comparatively easy downstream processing for biodiesel and by-products segregation makes this a lucrative option. How- ever one of the crucial complications with enzymatic trans- esterification is the high cost of lipase enzyme inactivation in the presence of methanol with glycerol and the slow rate of reaction compared to the conventional method. FAME profiling of the algae-based biodiesel revealed the biodiesel standards and characteristics such as Cetane Number CN Iodine Value IV Cloud Point CP and Cold Filter Plug- ging Point CFPP that matches the standards set by the International Biodiesel Standard for Vehicles Rizwan et al. 2018 . These standards consider various factors including fuel properties oil content impact on the engine and emis- sion properties Mofijur et al. 2022 . Biogas Biogas is an inexhaustible fuel that comprises mainly CO2 and methane CH4 and some other gases. The quality of biogas depends mainly on the relative amount of methane which depends on the substrate and fermentation condi- tions. Biogas production comprises four major processes hydrolysis acetogenesis acidogenesis and methanogenesis Pan et al. 2019 . In the case of microalgae the higher lipid and protein content makes it less than the ideal feedstock for biogas through anaerobic digestion. However microalgae can utilize the CO2 emanating from the biogas stream and increase the methane content of the biogas thereby improv- ing its fuel properties. Gasification is one more method to generate biogas that includes partial oxidation and a com- bustible gas mixture of biomass at high temperatures San- tos-Sánchez et al. 2016 Situmorang et al. 2020 . Bioethanol The microalgal polysaccharides are broken down into sim- ple sugars using suitable microorganisms and bioethanol can be synthesized from various microalgae. Comprehen- sive carbohydrates are naturally found in algae e.g. starch cellulose laminarin mannitol and agar. Cholorococcum Chlamydomonas and Chlorella are a few species known for synthesizing bioethanol for their greater conversion rate than other algal species de Morais et al. 2019 Asimakopoulos et al. 2018 . Chlorococcum sp. produces ethanol under dark conditions and has 27 starch that can be utilized in 24 h at 25 C making it a prominent bioethanol source Banerjee et al. 2022 . Various green algae species include Dunaliella Chlorella Chlamydomonas Arthrospira Sargassum Spir- ulina Gracilaria Prymnesium parvum Euglena gracilis and Scenedesmus are known for bioethanol production Sun et al. 2018 . Bioethanol production is also carried out using the seaweed Ulva lactua by yeast fermentation. Plackett Burman s experimental design based on the immo- bilization technique on supported solid materials is an opti- mized method for bioethanol production El-Sayed et al. 2016 . This experiment reveals that bioethanol production is affected by various factors such as sugar concentration pH level and the size of the inoculums. High carbohydrate content and ease in cultivation make the brown algae suitable feedstock for ethanol production by fermentation. Brown seaweeds such as Ascophyllum nodosum and Laminaria digitata can produce bioethanol by biomass pre-treatment and hydrolysis through dilute sulphu- ric acid as well as certain commercially available enzymes Tedesco et al. 2021 . Fermentation of Laminaria hyperbo- rean by the yeast Pichia angophora produces a high amount of ethanol from laminarin and mannitol Obata et al. 2016 . From dry algal biomass 49 sugar was obtained on acid pre-treatment while 20 was studied on enzymatic hydroly- sis de Souza et al. 2020 . The yield of ethanol synthesis by seaweed after fermentation is usually 0.08 and 0.12 kg kg dry seaweed. It depends on different pre-treatment and hydrolysis processes and algae genera Gao et al. 2020 . In the case of Ulva lactuca ethanol production after hydro- thermal pre-treatment declined even after removing sugar. Fermentation using acid hydrolysis agar for the conversion of sugar into ethanol reported in red algae is low. Bio jet fuel Globally the airline industry requires 5 million barrels of oil per day. CO2 water vapor H2O nitrogen oxides NOx carbon monoxide CO sulphur oxides SOx unburned or partially combusted hydrocarbons particulates and other trace compounds produced during jet fuel combustion are hazardous to the environment O Neil et al. 2019 . These airline industries change the world s atmosphere resulting in climate change and ozone depletion Parker 2021 . The main focus of the airline industry is to reduce its carbon footprint by using eco-friendly fuel. Bio-jet fuel is renewable fuel in the aviation industry that can decline 60 80 airlines related greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel-oriented jet fuel Datta et al. 2019 . Jet fuel is classified as civil or commercial jet fuel and military fuel. Commercial jet fuel is further classified into three subcate- gories Jet A-1 Jet A and Jet B among which JetA-1 and Jet A are kinds of kerosene fuels but Jet B is the combination of gasoline and majorly kerosene so that it can be utilized in frosty climate. Military jet fuel is classified as JP-4 JP-5 and JP-8. Antioxidants dispersants and corrosion inhibitor 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 244 Page 6 of 25 properties make JP-5 and JP-8 chemically intensified to fulfil the needs of the aviation sector Kumar et al. 2019 . To obtain distinct properties required by the avia- tion industry the bio-jet fuel is made using a mixture of microalgae biofuel and regular petroleum jet fuel which is termed green bio-jet fuel Why et al. 2019 . Algal biomass is converted into liquefied hydrocarbon fuel through gasi- fication mediated by synthetic gas production particularly CO and H2 and by Fischer Tropsch F T process Chen et al. 2015 . By hydrotreatment hydrotreated fatty acids and esters HEFA the microalgae biodiesel can be trans- formed into jet fuel as certified by ASTM standard D7566. The fuel obtained can be utilized as a commercial mixture with at least 50 conventional jet fuel. Therefore this type of fuel is called Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil HVO Hydro- treated Renewable Jet HRJ or Bio-derived Synthetic Par- affinic Kerosene Bio-SPK . Synthesis of Bio-SPK HEFA includes oil cleaning by eliminating the impurities through a specific method. Removing oxygen results in short-chain diesel-range paraffin converting olefins to paraffin through hydrogen mediated process. The elimination of oxygen and removal of olefins leads to enhancement in the heat of com- bustion and thermal and oxidative stability. The subsequent reactions are isomerization and crack diesel range paraffin to attain jet range carbon numbers resulting in the synthesis of a similar molecule in regular petroleum jet fuel Goh et al. 2022 . Various aviation industries are conducting worldwide research and practical implementations of microalgae bio- fuel. Flight Continental 737 800 was tested for 1.5 h on 7th January 2009 fueled with a 50 50 mixture of bio-jet fuel produced from 47.5 jatropha 2.5 algae and Jet-A1 fuel. Another attempt was made with flight JAL 747 300 of 1.5 h on 30th January 2009 fueled with a 50 50 mixture of bio-jet fuel obtained from feedstock camelina 84 jatropha 16 and algae 1 Hendricks et al. 2011 . Biohydrogen The forthcoming desire for clean fuel can be overcome by generating biohydrogen from algae. Despite a few challenges of biomass pre-treatment conversion efficacy extensive storage and economic viability algae is a most eminent source of biohydrogen production Mandotra et al. 2021 . The enormous industrial attention is attained by algae-medi- ated biohydrogen production the three major ways known for biohydrogen production are water photolysis acidogenic stage of organic matter anaerobic digestion and dual-stage dark fermentation González-Fernádez et al. 2012 . Algae rises as a prominent source of biohydrogen production due to the ability of photolysis of water molecule into hydrogen via hydrogenase activity. Algae species like Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Anabaena variabilis have obtained extra interest due to their immensely higher enhanced hydrogen production capacity De Bhowmick et al. 2019 . Biohydro- gen synthesis on a massive scale is not industrially viable due to excessive manufacturing cost involvement of modern machinery utilization of extremely sensitive hydrogenase enzyme and reduced biomass fixation. The major chal- lenge with algae-mediated photolysis is the oversensitiv- ity of hydrogenase enzymes toward oxygen. To evade this challenge of photosynthetic inhibition to produce H2 and O2 are momentarily alienated among dual stages. In usu- ally photosynthesis H2 abundant substrate is used to secure CO2 followed in stage I followed by nurturing of microalgae under the sulphur deprived condition in stage II. Various research suggested that under aerobic and sulphur deprived conditions the algae cell wall carbohydrate is converted into hydrogen and ultimately leads to biohydrogen production Bhattacharya and Goswami 2020 . H2 production from algae by photolysis is highly energy efficient in contrary to water electrolysis Show et al. 2018 . Hence for CO2 con- sumption as an air contaminant and sustainable water use for biohydrogen production algae-mediated biophotolysis is the most prominent strategy. However to conquer the challenge of low productivity from algae at a commercial scale innovative advancements in techniques are immensely required. Genetically modified microalgae and co-culture with other microbes might be another solution for H2 yield enhancement. Algal bioactive and nutraceutical compounds Lipids Microalgae are evaluated as a suitable source for biofuel synthesis based on their fatty acid profiles similar to soya oil with respect to the degree of the carbon carbon bond Yaşar 2020 . Under specific conditions microalgae biomass con- stitutes about 50 triglycerides TAG out of which about 70 are unsaturated and that is an appropriate form of lipid for biodiesel production Sun et al. 2018 . In microalgae palmitic acid C16 0 palmitoleic acid C16 1 stearic acid C18 0 oleic acid C18 1 linoleic acid C18 2 and lino- lenic acid C18 3 are normal triglycerides and the rest of the lipids are mostly diglycerides and phospholipids. Polar lipids such as MUFA PUFA waxes glycolipids or phy- tosterols and non-polar lipids like TAG molecules are syn- thesized by microalgae in large amounts Santos-Sánchez et al. 2016 . Fatty acid alkyl ether green diesel and bio-oils are the algae-derived biodiesel as shown in Fig. 2. About 70 of the unsaturated lipid content of the algae-derived biodiesel leads to reduced cold flow problems whereas in phospholipids the elevation of phosphate groups leads to increased cat-cracking units Tang et al. 2020a b . 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 Page 7 of 25 244 PUFA such as docosahexaenoic acid DHA eicosap- entaenoic acid EPA linoleic acid LA gamma-linolenic acid GLA and arachidonic acid AA are synthesized in massive amounts by certain microalgae de Morais et al. 2015 . Algae-derived PUFA manifests numerous properties such as antioxidant antibacterial antiviral detoxification hypercholesterolemia prohibition enhancing brain poten- tial and boosting immune-stimulatory effects de Morais et al. 2015 . DHA oil from algae marketed by Martek Bio- science is a supplement for an infant which is validated by Food and Drug Administration FDA . Schizochytrium sp. and Crypthecodinium cohnii are reported to produce abundant DHA. The PUFA DHA and EPA from microal- gae are the ultimate source of omega-3 fatty acids with a cost of around 80 160 kg 1 and potentially reaching around 898.7 million by 2025 Tang et al. 2020a b . Fish was considered the primary source for DHA production a couple of years back but is found unsuitable due to drawbacks like the foul smell and prohibition of fish oil as a food ingredi- ent by vegans Bartek et al. 2021 . Also a global decrease in fish stock was observed due to leakage of ship fuel and toxic industrial waste containing mercury dioxins chlorin- ated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls PCB Zappi et al. 2019 . In contrast to seed oil the microalgae lipid has a higher amount of omega-3 fatty acid which makes microal- gae lipid production economically sustainable Rizwan et al. 2018 Benavente-Valdés et al. 2016 . Pigments Algae are photosynthetic organisms with various light-sen- sitive pigments with distinct functions. Besides chlorophyll there are photosynthetic compounds like phycobiliproteins and carotenoids. Microalgae are gaining enormous atten- tion as a natural source of pigments and carotenoids. These pigments are utilized in various nutraceutical pharmaceuti- cal and cosmeceutical industries as manifested in Table 1. Because of health and environmental safety considerations synthetic products like pigments are a significant defeat. In such circumstances microalgae pigments and carotenoids such as β-carotene astaxanthin canthaxanthin and phyco- biliproteins have been recognized as a great relief Shourie et al. 2022 . Pigments are utilized as natural colorants in orange juice chewing gum ice sorbets candies soft drinks dairy items and edible supplements Sun et al. 2015 . Pig- ments and carotenoids prevent various diseases like cancer metabolic disorders diabetes eye diseases and neurogen- erative disorders. Pigments are highly utilized as diagnostic tools like fluorescent markers O Neil et al. 2019 . The antioxidant characteristic of carotenoids lacking in synthetic colorants is developing a significant role in pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries as shown in Table 2 Sathasivam et al. 2018 . Astaxanthin is considered a super oxidant due to its high antioxidant activity in com- parison to other carotenoids Sarma et al. 2021 . Astaxan- thin is a keto-pigment with various anti-inflammatory anti- apoptotic and singlet molecular oxygen-quenching activity Cao et al. 2021 . In contrast to tocopherol astaxanthin has 100-fold more health benefits due to its antioxidant property Sztretye et al. 2019 . Haematococcus pluvialis naturally produces astaxanthin under stressed conditions when the thin flagellated algae cell turns red non-motile cell Telli and Şahin 2020 . A Few microalgae species considered major astaxanthin producers are Haematococcus pluvia- lis Chlorella zofingiensis Chlamydomonas nivalis Bot- ryococcusbraunii Chlorella Vulgaris Monoraphidium sp. Chlamydocapsa sp. Neospongiococcum sp. Chlorococcum sp. and Scenedesmus obliquus Cao et al. 2021 .

Vitamin A displays diverse advantages in the health sector like cornea protec- tion anti-aging anticancer immune modulation prevent cardiovascular diseases and requisite for expecting moth- ers and children Situmorang et al. 2020 . Anti-carcinogenic property has also been observed in β-carotene according to National Cancer Institute. In treating cardiac diseases β-carotene was used to influence cholesterol levels. The sig- nificance of Vitamin A can be estimated by the health issue generated by its deficiency including immune impairment night blindness xerophthalmia and blindness in children. In contrast to synthetic β-carotene microalgae extracted β-carotene is more efficient antioxidant with improved prop- erties. Synthetic β-carotene produces only trans-isomers instead the algal β-carotene produces either cis or trans-iso- mers. β-carotene is also being utilized as additives in animal feed and food colorant Mata et al. 2010 .

Algal proteins have also been extensively explored as biofertilizers com- mercial enzymes bioplastics and even surfactants. Some reported enzymes synthesized from microalgae for com- mercial purposes are phytases α-galactosidase protease laccases lipase cellulases amylolytic enzymes antioxi- dant enzymes and carbonic anhydrase Brasil et al. 2017 . According to their spectral properties phycobiliproteins are widely distributed into three vital groups Phycocyanin allo- phycocyanin and phycoerythrin Freitas et al. 2022 . In the nutraceutical and cosmeceutical industries Phycocyanin and Phycoerythrin obtained from algae are essential as shown in Table 1. Phycobiliproteins have distinctly fluorescent char- acteristics due to which it is used as a labeling reagent in various techniques including flow cytometry fluorescence immunoassay immunohistochemistry and other biomedi- cal science activities Chew et al. 2017 Manirafasha et al. 2016 . For a natural blue pigment c-Phycocyanin Spirulina platensis is considered as the putative source Chew et al. 2019 . The manufacturers and suppliers of phycobiliproteins are Biotech Corp Columbia Bioscience and Quanta Phy. Inc Hu 2019 . In red algae vital polysaccharides are found carrageenan and agar while in brown algae glucan mannitol and algi- nate are the important carbohydrates observed Khanra et al. 2020a b . Alginate alginic acid is the main compo- nent of the cell wall in brown algae that comprises of about 40 dry weight Baweja et al. 2016 . In a food cosmetics stabilizers emulsifiers lubricants thickening agents and clinical drugs the algal carbohydrates are utilized by vari- ous industries. Other microalgal polysaccharides can act as metal ion chelators and bind to micronutrients important for plant nutrition Michalak and Chojnacka 2015 . Types of polysaccharides ulvans carrageenan and fucoidans are known as sulphate polysaccharides as these contain sulphate esters da Silva Vaz et al. 2016a . These exhibit anti-tumor antiviral and antioxidant properties and are also explored as food additives and are usually obtained from Chlorella Vul- garis and Scenedesmus quadricauda. Sulphated polysac- charide is also known to obstruct the migration and adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes due to which it is used in curing anti-inflammatory skin disorders. A cosmeceutical product marketed as Alguronic acid is a mixture of polysac- charides extracted from green algae Malik et al. 2020 . Green products Biochar The solid carbonized product acquired after the thermal decomposition of algae biomass under limited oxygen sup- ply is known as biochar. Biochar obtained from microalgae consists of aggregates within the 10 100 μm with a 1 μm irregular porosity Das et al. 2018 . The microalgal biochar has a lower carbon content surface area and cation exchange capacity than the lignocellulosic biochar. It has higher pH and hence can be used to balance acidified soil. It is rich in nutrients like nitrogen ash and inorganic elements add- ing to soil fertility. It is also applied to the soil to protect it from undesirable microorganisms Michalak and Chojnacka 2015 . It is widely used for air and water cleansing because of its hydrophobic and absorbent properties along with functional groups having hydrophilic nature like carboxylic acids aldehyde and hydroxyl Mohan et al. 2020 . Accord- ingly biochar is used as a strengthening agent in cement and organic polymers a carbon source for synthetic gas synthesis and a substitute for coke in steel production due to its low ash content Michalak and Chojnacka 2015 . Bioplastics Biopolymer produced from microalgae is most acceptable globally in contrast to synthetic polymers. Recent research shows upgraded mechanical properties in algae-mediated biopolymers compared to synthetic polymers Beckstrom et al. 2020 . Biodegradable characteristics of algae-mediated bioplastic are a cause of global attention. Polyhydroxyal- kanoates PHAs are one of the algae-based biodegradable plastic polymers which can be classified into three catego- ries based on the number of carbon atoms in the backbone of biopolymers a short chain with 5 carbon a moderate chain with 6 14 carbon and long-chain 15 carbon Raza et al. 2018 . Various PHA-originated products like Biopol Nodax Degr Pol and Biogreen are present in the market for different applications Dietrich et al. 2017 Anjum et al. 2016 . Algae protein can generate bioplastic via a thermo- mechanical polymerization reaction Devadas et al. 2021 . Utilizing microalgae for the production of bioplastic is much more prominent and economical due to the presence of high protein content Khalis 2018 . Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp. due to their high and complex protein content are suc- cessfully utilized for bioplastic production polymers Deva- das et al. 2021 Chia et al. 2020 . Green nanoparticle A new and green approach for synthesizing nanoparticles is using algae mainly belonging to Phaeophyceae Chlo- rophyceae and Rhodophyceae Chugh et al. 2021 . As discussed above algae is an affluent source of secondary metabolites and various biomolecules leading to consider- able nano-biofactories Nahvi et al. 2021 . Algae exhibit various benefits including metal hyper-accumulation fast doubling time convenient handling non-toxic cost-effec- tive and environmentally suitable for the biosynthesis of 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 244 Page 12 of 25 green nanoparticles Negi and Singh 2018 . Hence algae are prevalent for synthesizing distinct metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles such as silver zinc gold palladium etc. Chaudhary et al. 2021 . The green synthesis of nanoparti- cles is influenced by various physical parameters including pH type of metal metal precursor concentration bio extract reaction mixture intact duration light source temperature and so on AlNadhari et al. 2021 . The size shape and crystallinity of the nanoparticles directly depend upon the nucleation growth aging agglomeration and stabilization of nanoparticles influenced by the above-mentioned physical parameters Aboelfetoh et al. 2017 . Algae-mediated nano- particles attain global attention considering versatile bio- medical applications like gene therapy anticancer therapy drug delivery antimicrobial activity biosensors and imag- ing Mandhata et al. 2022 . Exopolymers EPS Microalgae EPS have been emerged as the sustainable alter- native for various biotechnological process. Environmental biotechnology has pioneered the use of these biopolymers as biosurfactants and heavy metal biosorbents Babiak and Krzemińska 2021 . These are ways for reducing pollution that are both economically and environmentally effective. EPS are carbon and energy reserves for cells that are fre- quently expelled by microalgae as part of physiological processes or when they are under stressed Moreria et al. 2022 . During physiological activities microalgae produce large amounts of EPS compounds notably at the decline of the growth phase when the extracellular polymer acts as a flocculant. In a study the auto flocculation activity in pres- ence of EPS was studied for Scenedesmus obliquus AS-6 1 until the end of the exponential phase which increased with cultivation period and medium cell concentration Guo et al. 2013 . Additionally EPS are also necessary for the formation of a biological soil crust biofilm . By causing surface sealing and pore blockage this treatment decreases water infiltration into the soil. As a result the availability of nutrients increases and the aggregate stability of the soil improves. The microalgae Chlorella minutissima Chlorella sorokiniana and Botryococcus braunii were studied for EPS synthesis Moreria et al. 2022 . The effects of nitrogen and carbon contents in the culture media as well as light inten- sity on EPS formation were investigated Koçer et al. 2021 . Bhati and Mallick et al. 2015 observed P and N deficiency results in P 3HB accumulation in Nostoc muscorum while studying the thermal and mechanical properties of P 3HB and P 3HB-CO-3HV copolymer films obtained by micro- organism. EPS also has antioxidant anti-inflammatory anticancer antiviral antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties all of which help to advance natural medicines and nutraceuticals industry. Techno economic feasibility Algae-based biofuel is a futuristic approach in the world s energy scenario but besides algae-based investigations and technological development the most vital aspect of ana- lyzing for the commercialization of algae products is the expense of processes employed. Simultaneous synthesis of value-added products during algae fuel production is the most cost-effective and feasible method to decrease manu- facturing cost. Kuppens et al. 2015 delineate TEA as an evaluation of economic feasibility of a new technology that aims to improve the social or environmental impact and that helps the decision makers in directing research and develop- ment or investments. The TEA model creates comprehensive analysis of direct connection among economic and techni- cal aspects of algal biorefinery approach Thomassen et al. 2018 . The total manufacturing cost is obtained by summing the direct and indirect production costs and general manufactur- ing expenditure. Net present value NPV Return on invest- ment ROI Discounted payback period DPP and Internal rate of return IRR are four economic indicators which helps to evaluate the project investment as represented in Fig. 3. The NPV is usually determined using following equation Wu and Chang 2019 . Referring the Eq. 1 cumulative discount price CF tis estimated by applying following equation where TCI is total capital investment and TMC is total manufacturing cost Wu and Chang 2019 .

NPV and DPP are directly influenced by CF t Turton et al. 2008 . The IRR obtained through an equation mentioned below Wu and Chang 2019 . TEA model can be prepared in Excel nevertheless inputs from precise process design software including Aspen Plus USA DESIGN II USA ChemCad USA SuperPro Designer USA and UniSim Design Canada are considered relevant Shah et al. 2016a b Kasani et al. 2022 . In the microalgae cultivation system external factors including temperature intensity of light and nutrient avail- ability affect algal species creating variation in product profiles Singh and Patidar 2021 . Consequently highly controlled and optimized conditions are required to attain the desirable products. Lipid elevation leads to depletion of value-added products in biomass which influences the economy. The major complications in the economic evalu- ation are CO2 supply costs along with unpredictable behav- iour of downstream processing. The open pond cultivation system is preferred over photobioreactors PBRs as it is four times less expensive. Kumar et al. 2020a b c reported TEA of microalgae biomass cultivated on dairy wastewater examined via capital expenditure CAPEX and operational expenditure OPEX analysis. They reported remediation of 240 000 m3 of wastewater at cost of 0.482 kg 1 with 504 tons yr of microalgal biomass production. Large volume V-shaped pond is preferred as reduced land foot printing and cost. Remediation of commercial waste directly by micro- algae leads to 80 treated water suitable for agricultural practices Kumar et al. 2020a b c . The equation used to determine microalgae biomass production price MBPP in kg is mentioned below 3 0 Nt t 0 CF t 1 + IRR t where CRF is Capital recovery factor estimated by percent- age of interest rate and project lifespan. The model was developed with Aspen Plus software. Algae-mediated biofuel production can become inexpensive only when suitable options are opted such as Dunaliella salina cultivated in an open pond sys- tem instead of PBRs to produce β-carotene nonetheless Haematococcus pluvialis cultivated in PBRs can be used to extract astaxanthin which has a high market value of about 1200 1500. TEA model in above study was cre- ated by excel based spreadsheet model Thomassen et al. 2016 . Table 3 displays functioning large-scale algae cul- tivation for extraction of biofuel and value-added products at commercial level by distinct companies. Nevertheless low biomass production and excessive water requirement increase the cost of the entire process Malik et al. 2020 Vasistha et al. 2021b Davis et al. 2014 . Harvesting the microalgae biomass from both race- way ponds and PBRs is costly due to expensive dewater- ing process. Fasaei et al. 2018 performed the TEA on microalgae harvesting and dewatering in both open and closed systems using TEA model generated by excel. The operational expense of harvesting and dewatering in open and closed system were observed 0.5 2 kg 1 and 0.1 0.6 kg 1 algae biomass respectively with the energy requirement of 0.2 5 kWh kg 1 of algae for open system and 0.1 0.7 kWh kg 1 algae for closed system. Hence they concluded that harvesting and dewatering contribute 3 15 of the production costs of algae biomass which can be reduced by opting appropriate cultivation system and harvesting techniques. Flocculation of the microalgae culture is preferred over centrifugation for biomass har- vesting on account of low energy consumption and cost Fasaei et al. 2018 . 4 MBPP Kg CRF CAPEX + OPEX TBM Table 3 Large-scale production of algal products produced by distinct companies profitably Company suppliers Country Item Cultivation system Profit References Alga technologies Israel Astaxanthin Closed and semi-closed bioreactors under high light intensity 7.7 million Shah et al. 2016a b Sapphire energy Inc United states High value oils aquaculture and animal feed Open pond photosynthetic growth system 37.6 million Banu et al. 2020 Bio Real Inc United states Astaxanthin Indoor photobioreactor 49.46 million Shah et al. 2016a b Cyanotech Hawaii Astaxanthin Spirulina pacifica as food ingredient Raceway pond and photobio- reactors 21.23 million Panis and Carreon 2016 Algenol Biotech LLC United states Bioethanol gasoline jet fuel biodiesel Photobioreactor 3.1 million Algenol Biotech 2019 Algae.

Usually 30 lipid is achieved from approximately10 000 tonnes of algae feedstock at the cost of 2.80 L and with petroleum the cost is about 1.10 L the process configuration is modelled using Aspen Plus Banu et al. 2020 Davis et al. 2011 . Few species like Nannochloris sp. Dunaliella sp. and Chlorella sp. are able to produce 50 lipid content Harvey and Ben-Amotz 2020 . Based on fatty acid profiling it can be inferred that algal oil has a high amount of saturated fatty acids SFAs and polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs . Cold flow and oxidative stress properties deteriorate simultaneously due to the high amounts of SFAs and PUFAs. Algal biodiesel has also been approved on the limit of kinematic viscos- ity decided by standards Thomassen et al. 2016 . The algae biorefinery module for TEA was developed by using GREET model for large-scale algal cultivation and bio- fuel production by downstream processing. It was evalu- ated that with a minimum market cost of 5 Gal to 22 Gal the capital needed for biodiesel synthesis is approxi- mately 9.8 20.5 Gal Pérez-López et al. 2018 . The cost of biodiesel increases due to high energy consumption dur- ing anaerobic digestion in the form of heat approximately 2.5 MJ kg DM and electricity approximately 0.39 MJ kg DM Wang et al. 2020 . TEA conducted on biorefinery model to sequester CO2 from upstream coal-fired power plants and recycles the CO2 produced for algae cultivation to obtain value-added products. It became discovered that the optimum CO2 sequestration and usage value turned into reduced from 33.65 ton of CO2 to 9.52 ton of CO2 as the power plant length of 300 2400 MW. This study involves MINPL optimized model proposed to reduce CO2 sequestration along with TEA constraints Gong and You 2014 Methane production range from 0.16 to 0.80 CH4 kg DM depends upon the composition of algal species and biodegradable potential Barlow et al. 2016 . About 40 50 of the capital of entire manufacturing is consumed during downstream processing which is based on the item manufactured. Techno-economic feasibility of the inte- grated biorefinery approach is estimated as 14.16 mil- lion total investment 17.42 million internal return rate 3.3 years reimbursement duration with 8.19 million total existing value. The result leads to the co-production of various products including biodiesel glycerol biogas and animal feed making this approach highly feasible Kumar et al. 2019 . Microalgae cultivation on wastewater and processing of that biomass thermo-chemically by hydrothermal liq- uefaction HTL make the production of biodiesel techno- economically viable and environmentally friendly Rahbari et al. 2021 . Microalgae have the potential to grow on waste- water together with waste streams that reduce the cost of artificial media and remediate the wastewater. It contains nutrients such as nitrogen majorly ammoniacal nitrogen carbon both organic and inorganic and phosphorus thereby reducing the cost of the growth medium. Water under its threshold level has high energy reducing energy consumption up to 60 80 in tertiary treatment Persiani et al. 2021 . Naturally occurring algae carrying lipids or modified algal cells from direct photosynthetic transformation makes the whole process more economical by reducing downstream processing expense Banu et al. 2020 . The price of algal processing to get biogas and biodiesel can be decreased via upgrading mainly primary and secondary harvesting meth- ods. After lipid extraction the de-oiled microalgae bio- mass was demonstrated to digest anaerobically making this approach cost-effective and eco-friendly Vargas-Estrada et al. 2021 . Algal biodiesel is considered a viable option for future transport energy as the energy intensity of algal biodiesel is 2.5 times exceeding that of conventional diesel Lim et al. 2021 . Algal biodiesel production can become economical and environmentally sustainable by its co-production and electric decarbonization during production Santos-Sánchez et al. 2016 . This approach becomes more feasible by pro- ducing biodiesel from lipid and synthesizing bioethanol enzymatically from the remaining de-oiled algae biomass Kouzuma and Watanabe 2015 . Based on ongoing algal fuel research many small-scale companies have already established a problem related to techniques and methods. For the commercialization of algal fuel genetic alteration of algae species with an advance downstream approach for separation and extraction is signifi- cantly required. Mainly upstream improvement regarding genetic alteration of algal species and downstream improve- ment for segregation and extraction technologies are manda- tory. The integrated biorefinery approach is the only option to make algal fuel economical and catch the interest of vari- ous industries to its profitability and environmental sustain- ability as shown in Fig. 4 Dasan et al. 2019 . Hence in a precise way to make algal biodiesel economi- cal following aspects are required to be considered including increasing a photosynthetic potential and production b advancement in cultivation system reduced requirement of water and nutrient c modified cell harvesting techniques d suitable lipid extraction and cell disruption methods e increase the simultaneous synthesis of high value-added products f decrease biodiesel manufacturing expense from algal lipid g attention on zero waste management. 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 Page 15 of 25 244 Life cycle assessment LCA LCA analysis is a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of any algal product on the environment viability and energy dynamics. As determined by guidelines of international organization for standardization ISO with series 14040 44 to conduct LCA four major segments are defining goal and scope life cycle inventory LCI analysis life cycle impact assessment LCIA and life cycle interpretation Talwar and Holden 2022 . Steps evaluated in LCA are algae cultivation dewatering extraction conversion and production of bio- diesel and value-added products Strazza et al. 2015 . Vari- ous biofuel production techniques and economic feasibility have been successfully evaluated through LCA Olguín et al. 2015 . LCA measures the sustainability and environmental effects of the algae-based biofuel processes Chowdhury and Franchetti 2017 . Net energy ratios NERs and greenhouse gas emissions GHG are evaluated using LCA. Comprehen- sive energy efficacy of algal biorefinery is estimated in terms of NER. A biorefinery approach considered economically viable when energy investment remains less than energy obtained therefore NER 1 indicated cost-effective biore- finery approach De Bhowmick et al. 2019 . The equation for calculating NER is given below John et al. 2011 From an industrialization perspective different cultiva- tion harvesting and extraction techniques were analysed in Table 4. The GHG ratio was found to be excessive in the case of de-oiled algal biomass Kyriakopoulou et al. 2015 . To enhance the feasibility of the algal biorefinery pro- cess optimization of growth conditions advancement in techniques along with the utilization of co-products are essential. Prominently environmental effects of a process are analysed in LCA specifically based on conventional and integrated methods for biofuel production Kyriakopoulou et al. 2015 . SimaPro software analyses GHG emissions of the whole biorefinery process. LCA model obtained using GREET Model 2013 for bioenergy production from micro- algae conducted through HTL with NER 1.23 and 11.4 g CO2-eq MJ 1 GHG emission contrary to bioenergy produc- tion via pyrolysis with NER 2.27 and 210 g CO2-eq MJ 1 GHG emission Bennion et al. 2015 . Banu et al. 2020 reported a comparative research analysis of conventional and integrated biofuel production technology on environ- ment using SimaPro software. The result revealed that 94 GHG emission was observed in conventional extraction with 84 energy consumption instead 50 GHG emission was 5 Net Energy Ratio Energy obtained Energy invested Fig. 4 Algal biorefinery a cir- cular sustainable approach De Bhowmick et al. 2019 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 244 Page 16 of 25 Table 4 LCA based study on variety of algae species undergoing biorefinery approach and their environmental effects GWP global warming potential FER fossil energy requirement ADP abiotic depletion EP eutrophication potential E-toxicity ecotoxicity H-toxicity human toxicity OD ozone depletion POP photochemical oxidation potential ACP acidification potential MAEP marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential FWAEP fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity potential UAE ultrasound-assisted extraction Algae Industrial products Environmental effects Economical analysis References Arthrospira platensis Food and animal feed Non-renewable energy consumption GWP respiratory inorganics emissions Autotrophic and heterotrophic cultivation provides a better yield than the traditional method Olguín et al. 2015 Chlorella sp.

Mu et al. 2014 use the GREET model to perform LCA on 16 distinct path- ways among which they reported the most environmentally sustainable pathway is algal cultivation followed by wet lipid extraction with 6.9 kg of CO2 eq kg 1 GHG emissions Mu et al. 2014 . In a study performed by Sun et al. 2019 LCA model generated by software of OpenLCA was applied in algae-mediated biofuel production. Study aimed at evalua- tion of LCA of transesterification HTL pyrolysis anaerobic digestion deprived of pre-treatment and anaerobic digestion with pre-treatment the NER values obtained are1.52 1.25 2.46 1.27 and 0.71 respectively along with 10.37 6.77 265.26 173.02 and 60.84 g CO2 eq GHG emission. Among these techniques the most economical and eco- friendly approach was anaerobic digestion with pre-treat- ment Sun et al. 2019 . Consideration of raw matter and any discharges during synthesis aqueous aerial or land are also included. The algal biodiesel shows low impacts for eutroph- ication and land use which is explained by the high biomass yield and use of wastelands. Also algae biofuel has less impacted soil acidification and human toxicity because of the lack of fertilizer and pesticides usage Banu et al. 2020 . Industries and technology transfer analysis Recently numerous industries and research organizations have been involved in microalgae biorefinery to establish a remarkable global market. A few companies Solazyme Zen U Biotechnology Co. Ltd Cyanotech Corporation and Algaeon Inc are actively marketing valuable products obtained from microalgae Silva et al. 2020 . Euglena Co. Ltd based in Japan founded in 2005 has developed defat- ted Euglena biomass for the rich protein source Ritala et al. 2017 . Euglena Co. Ltd and Algaeon are selling β glu- can from Euglena. Cyanotech Corporation is the producer of Spirulina used as a food ingredient the company is based in the US a reached a total revenue of 32 billion in 2016. Some microalgae species like Dunaliella salina and Aph- anizomenon flosaquae are marketed by Qianqiu Biotech- nology Co. Ltd for β carotene and Blue-green food for β glucan respectively. Vigani et al. mentioned the company s survey for the product formation from microalgae biomass which can be utilized as feed or food Vigani et al. 2015 . The worldwide microalgae pigment astaxanthin market has recently reached USD 600 million in 2018 and is expected to reach USD 800 million in 2025 Global Market Insights 2019 . The primary company involved in the commercial production of astaxanthin was Asta Real group established in 1994. Astaxanthin is marketed in three different varieties Asta Real oleoresin Asta Real EL25 Asta Real 1010 Silva et al. 2020 . The increasing market interest in Phycocya- nin pigment has reached the global market value of USD 112.3 in 2018. The French company algosource ource. com develops liquid Phycocyanin whereas another company named Sipra produces power phycocyanin can be explored for health benefits. The company Sun Chlo- rella based in the United King- dom manufacture Chlorella powder granules and tablets prepared by mixing Chlorella extract with malic. The Euro- pean organization has funded project ABACUS Horizon 2020 on microalgae biorefinery with the prime objective of carotenoid production for the nutraceutical and cosmet- ics sectors Silva et al. 2020 . Cellana organization situated in the USA is involved in producing biofuel PUFA and animal feed from microalgae biomass. The market value of microalgal research and industry today is indicated by patent activity which determines inno- vation and development. Several patents have been filed by various companies on algae -based valuable products such as food supplements and high-value proteins. An extensive bibliometric analysis of filed patents was done using Espace- net and Orbit databases representing technological trends in the field of microalgal bioremediation and biorefinery Pessoa et al. 2021 . Table 5 includes distinct technology transfer by the industries and companies on microalgae biorefinery oriented products. A technology was patented by Jiaxing Zeyuan Biolog Products Co. Ltd that provides an important solution in large-scale production of astaxanthin from microalgae. Another patent was filed by Parry Nutra- ceuticals omega-3 fatty acid production using microalgae. In addition Carbion Biotech Inc. invented technology for microalgae-based flour production enet. com . The flour was made by culturing microalgal cells of a Chlorella protothecoides strain at favourable pH and dissolved oxygen conditions to yield a desired amount of lipid. The newest market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 10.3 reaching 1.8 bil- lion during the period 2021 2028 mainly in nutraceuticals animal feed cosmetics food and beverages Bhattacharya and Goswami 2020 . Biofuel policies implementations and blending targets The sustainable commercialization of renewable energy sources like biofuel and bioethanol depends on govern- ment organization s legal guidelines and transparent poli- cies. At this juncture the first mandate on biofuel was adopted in 1948 the Indian Power Alcohol Act 1948 Act No. 22 of 1948 Vasistha et al. 2021a b . The prime focus of the Act was the Power Alcohol industry in India. The mandate was repleaded in 2000 Indian Power Alcohol Act replea 2000 Moshood et al. 2021 . The US Govern- ment initiated research support by approving a bill signed 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 244 Page 18 of 25 by the Senate Committee in August 2012 which states the tax credit of algal fuels. Energy Independence Security Act EISA was established to commercialize biofuel pro- duction Saravanan et al. 2020 . The biofuels policies were first recognized by Brazil followed by the US and Europe Union. In Brazil ethanol was marked as the official fuel by the State of Pernambuco. In 2017 the National Biofuel Policy Renovabio was adopted in Brazil to upsurge the production of biofuels Klein et al. 2019 . The Draft Rus- sian Energy Strategy was extended up till 2035 in Russia with the goal of 12 electricity generation from non-car- bon sources. The Russian government has set the National Standard GOST P523368-2005 to blend 5 biodiesel with other liquid fuels Saravanan et al. 2020 . In India the National Policy on Biofuel was implemented in 2008 to govern biofuel commercialization through firms and com- panies. In 2018 the National Policy Act was revised to achieve 20 ethanol blending in petrol E20 whereas 5 was biodiesel blending in diesel in 2030 Lin and Lu 2021 . In India Rajasthan was the first State to adopt the New Biofuel Policy in 2019. In addition the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas MoPNG released the notifi- cation for the ethanol blending Programme EBP in 2002 Moshood et al. 2021 . The successful implementation and adaptation of policies rely on the State government s stake- holders. Government officials should work on the concerns related to policies also the policies should be revised which can further improve the regulatory framework. Challenges and way forward Numerous industries already accept algae potential as an appropriate and sustainable feedstock for a circular bioec- onomy Stark et al. 2022 Sharma et al. 2021 . Biofuel and various high-value-added bio-products make algal biore- finery a competent choice for industries. Despite these tre- mendous potentials of biorefinery scaling up is inefficient due to some challenges at different stages of biorefinery Zhang et al. 2021 . The inadequate concentration of algal biomass in a fully grown algae culture is a crucial obstacle to the success of the biorefinery approach. Algal biomass quality and biochemical compositions vary due to seasonal- ity complications that influence the whole process s TEA. Open cultivation systems efficiently provide sufficient algae biomass cost-effectively but contamination is a significant concern due to which photobioreactors are preferred spe- cifically for edible products production Peter et al. 2022 .

Another significant issue associated with harvesting is reduced segregation ability and unsatisfactory quality of algae biomass Show et al. 2018 . The harsh cell destruction process reduces the functionality of various value-added products and excessive metal coagu- lants in flocculation can hamper the quality and quantity of ultimate bio-products Li et al. 2020 . High downstream cost with an inadequate amount of biomass leads to ineffi- cient product recovery. Extraction of high-value-added com- pounds like astaxanthin lutein carotene PUFA biofuel and other co-products like protein and carbohydrates can nul- lify the expense of cultivation and downstream processing Lupatini et al. 2017 Gilbert-López et al. 2017 . Apart from processing hindrance complicated rules and regulations for innovative edible products formed by discrete governments and regulatory sovereignty hinder algae products distribu- tion Sodano et al. 2016 . These combined challenges reduce the efficiency of algal biorefinery due to which large-scale algal biorefinery concepts become economically and sustain- ably nonviable. Innovative techniques of genetic engineering can enhance the biosynthesis of cellular components. Incorporation or elimination of target genes at the cellular level may elevate the synthesis of specific biomolecules Zhang et al. 2019 . Genetic engineering techniques collaborated with algal biorefinery may enhance the feasibility of algae-mediated biofuel production. In Spirulina sp. hydrogen production gets enhanced by genetically manipulating the hydroge- nase enzyme Li et al. 2021 . Besides genetic engineering metabolic engineering also appears as a novel option for enhancing biofuel yield through manipulating nitrogen flux. Proteins found in algal biomass through engineered nitrogen flux can be transformed into biofuel and make biorefinery cost-effective. Kumar et al. 2020a b c suggested that transformations in media composition and culture conditions directly affect algal biomass yield and value-added products like TAGs. Under pyruvate supplemented culture C. Zof- ingiensis results in 28 elevated astaxanthin like results observed in malic acid and citrate Yu et al. 2015 . Incor- porating ionic solvents instead of organic solvents in lipid extraction may result in higher yield without biomass dry- ing supporting a cost-effective biorefinery. Hence incorpo- rating innovative techniques and advanced approaches with a close loop bioeconomy leads to the revolutionarily efficient and sustainable algal biorefinery. Conclusion With an ever-escalating globalization and energy con- sumption the sustainable biorefinery model is imperative to highlight energy security and climate change. Integrat- ing algal technologies is considered a source of biofuel production and multiple value-added co-products as a biorefinery feedstock. The researchers focus on the biore- finery approach to extricate components encapsulated in microalgae overcoming significant challenges. Neverthe- less industrial microalgae application faces energy and cost challenges. This review discussed the detailed co- products from algae biomass. The LCA and TEA stud- ies were analysed with rigorous market perusal upgraded retrieval outcomes and sustainability index. Current research suggests that the commercialization of biodiesel can attain reduced production costs and increased energy return on investment EROI by an integrated algal biore- finery oriented fractionation approach. The simultaneous production of algal biodiesel with value-added co-products in an integrated biorefinery strategy leads to a more cost- effective and feasible alternative. This strategy ultimately improves energy efficacy in an environmentally sustainable manner and generates green employment. The government policies and effective implementation should be adopted for regulating the legal hurdles in the energy market. Future perspective Global interest in algal biorefinery is rising particularly for biofuel and value-added products. Bio-based indus- trialization is attaining enormous consideration due to its zero waste management strategy which is not evident in the production of synthetic products. Specific benchmarks have been established to promote algal biorefinery such as production cost appropriate algae strain selection and process viability. An integrated algal biorefinery is envi- ronmentally feasible but require major technical improve- ment that can be resolved by integrating innovative utiliza- tions of the Internet of things IoT technologies in algal biorefinery. IoT includes self-regulating automated algae cultivation administrating and manipulating cultivation variables productivity optimization recognize toxic algal species screening specific algal species classify micro- algae species along with algal cells sustainability detec- tion. To obtain cost-effective smart automatic and eco- friendly technology for microalgae biorefinery approach addition of IoT techniques are urge of future Tham et al. 2022 . Further research is highly recommended on a few aspects such as modifications in algal species and 3 Biotech 2022 12 244 1 3 244 Page 20 of 25 technological advancements in downstream processing. To attain enhanced desirable products using environmen- tal waste like wastewater and CO2 for growth has led to economic cultivation due to which production of algal products may become feasible for large-scale industries. Innovative research and development are desired for algal biorefinery for viable commercialization. Evaluation per- formed via LCA and TEA help in the identification of bottle- necks in these processes which will lead to further research and innovation. Additionally the ecological and monetary aspects must be portrayed while framing the government policies in the future.

A biorefinery approach has often been considered and microalgae as a feedstock has been pampered for its numerous possibilities to produce biofuels. Depending on the species and cultivation conditions microalgae can produce fats proteins and sugars. These raw materials can thus be utilized in the production of biofuels bioenergy and biochemicals. For this reason algal biofuels are considered as sustainable and renewable options for climate related challenges. However there are many issues such as supply infrastructure business and refinery opportunities as well as their efficacy tied to sustainable production of these energetic materials from algae. Thus technical maturity scalability energy and material balance demands coupled with cost nutrient resources demand certification and legislation are needed to demonstrate the biorefinery opportunities of algal biomass valorisation. This paper therefore recommends that various consortiums tasked with algal biofuel projects should be chosen for a more holistic integrated multidisciplinary approach to address the advancement of algal biofuel technology. 1. Introduction Looking for a sustainable resource and a viable feedstock remains the aspiration of biofuel scientists as well as engineers and entrepreneurs to finally deploy biofuel processes in an industrial and commercial quan tity. In order to deploy the advanced biofuels needed at the scale required technological advancements always came into play micro algae was prioritized as a viable feedstock since it is cheap available grow on marginal lands absorb CO2 utilize low-quality water and wastewater Saad et al. 2019 Bhushan et al. 2023 . For this reason it is not surprising that there are exaggerated expectations with excessive enthusiastic admiration for microalgae being a second and or third-generation biofuel which will probably materialize over a period of time. A rigorous consideration of technological and economic viability of algal biofuels surrounding their efficacy is needed to be demonstrated so as to consider algal as a viable renewable option Jabło nska-Trypu c et al. 2023 Wang et al. 2023 . Various sustainability issues have been under investigation such as demand and supply cost of nutrient resources energy and material balances technology readiness level certification and legislation scalability and logistics coupled with the valorisation of the co-products Alazaiza et al. 2023 Chisti and Yan 2011 Pienkos and Darzins 2009 Taheripour et al. 2010 . The key scientific and technological challenges facing algal biofuels and other biomass feedstock actualization are summarized by Luque et al. 2010 as follows.

Even though there are many simi larities variations obviously exist due to differences in characteristics in the raw materials evolutionary trends government policies regulations and economics of the process. By and large externalities connected with the algal bio-refinery processes underline the basis for their future per formance. Algal biofuels have been reported to have environmental benefits may provide a positive energy balance and could improve resource land-water energy management and minimize the ecological footprint of the production pathways Subhadra and Edwards 2010 Ayhan 2009 . However there exist many technical and non-technical issues related to the implementation and large-scale commercializa tion of bio-refineries. Major technical obstacles anticipated are the intertwined biomass and lipid productivity minimum economic returns with maximum cost of production coupled with feedstock supply and logistics. Other technical issues may include production systems opti mization composition properties harvesting extractions conversions and transportation Vassilev and Vassileva 2016 . This study aims to provide an overview of the technological maturity associated with the production and processing of algal biomass for chemical energy and biochemical production. A critical and system approach has been reviewed through a systematic database search with a different array of keywords. Finally a holistic integrated multidisci plinary approach with various consortiums tasked is suggested for the advancement of algal biofuel technology. 2. Methodology The literature search was carried out using the google scholar Sco pus and Web of Science database. The search was categorized into two aspects of algal production sustainability 1 upstream and 2 down stream processing. For each category the following keywords form the basis for the search distinctively and in synergy with algal biorefinery 1 throughput 2 energy input and output 3 design issues 4 servicing required 5 resources demand 6 value chain 7 cost range 8 mate rials for constructions and 8 scale-up issues. Throughout the studies 98 studies were utilized through full-text reading and desktop studies. Additionally and to succinctly cover most of the salient issues needed for the discussions of the biofuel production process No doubt it s a herculean task that requires comprehensive analysis we are confronted to include and begin with the preliminary and careful discussion of the following important issues i Lifecycle assessment LCA ii materials and energy balances iii scalability iv sustainability and governmental regulations v technical maturity that s is intertwined with overall throughput of the emerging technologies coupled with vi sustainable designed and supply routes of algal biorefinery. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Life cycle assessment The prime objective of LCA studies for microalgal biofuel production has always been to identify production bottlenecks and constraints and prosper future solutions to achieve sustainable and commercial micro algal biofuel production. An important caveat to remember is that LCA studies conducted on microalgae biofuel productions reflect the state of existing and available in an open academic literature and technolog ical status of the algae research sector Singh and Olsen 2011 Slade and Bauen 2013 . To make the future of microalgal studies brighter more information is needed in the public domain on the energy balance required for fertilization drying dewatering and conversion pro cesses carbon balance environmental impact and production cost. Therefore an integrated approach considering the above-highlighted issues will allow LCA practitioners towards conducting a sustainable LCA study. While technological advances leading to optimized produc tion system will help remedy energy balance empirical data designed specifically for algal biofuel production will go a long way in improving the algal biofuel production cost Chamkalani et al. 2020 . There is need for a detailed and comprehensive life cycle assessments of algal biofuel systems so as to evaluate genuinely the microalgal bio fuel production and its environmental impacts from the cultivation process to end-use algae process. This evaluation will consider resource use greenhouse emissions water usage land use energy consumption and waste generation. Various life cycle assessment LCA studies have analyzed the economic and environmental implications of nutrient de mand and resource supply sustainability in commercial-scale micro algae cultivation Venteris et al. 2014 Quinn et al. 2012 . Lardon et al. 2009 explored hypothetical scenarios for 100 ha open pond raceways cultivating Chlorella vulgaris aiming to optimize lipid fraction and identify drying obstacles under normal and low nitrogen fertilization levels. Several LCAs have been conducted in the light of exploring the significance of environmental impact categories such as energy con sumption greenhouse emissions land use water use and eutrophication and in comparison with traditional crops Clarens et al. 2010 Lardon et al. 2009 Jacquemin et al. 2012 Sander and Murthy 2010 Ste phenson et al. 2010 . Other studies considered system evaluation in terms of energy balance and requirements among distinctive cultivation platforms comparing economic profitability in combination with envi ronmental impact of algal biodiesel production noting a gap in inte grating nutrient recycling technologies Brentner et al. 2011 Guti errez-Arriaga et al. 2014 Handler et al. 2012 Johnson et al. 2013 Pate et al. 2011 Sills et al. 2012 Wigmosta et al. 2011 Brentner et al. 2011 . Furthermore some LCA practitioners underscored the impor tance of substrate availability and wastewater treatment plant capacities in facilitating integrated microalgae cultivation systems using a conse quential lifecycle assessment but a lack of elaboration on a detailed economic analysis and socio-economic factors in geospatial assessments poses limitations for broader applicability and scalability Huang et al. 2022 Bussa et al. 2020 . Potentials of various systems such as produc tion harvesting drying extractions systems belonging to both upstream and downstream technologies conversions methodologies such as transesterification hydrothermal liquefaction pyrolysis including sol vent extractions have been explored using life cycle assessments but most of these studies did not sufficiently. i address the challenges of scaling up and adaptation for larger production environment system that requires detailed pilot studies and engineering analysis ii neither does it have a thorough analysis of technical and logistics aspects as well as integration issues into existing biofuel infrastructure iii did not capture process alternatives and consider broader life cycle impacts or regulatory and market barriers iv talk less of looking deeper beyond production stages which is crucial for assessing the commercial viability and real-world applicability of these systems Huang et al. 2022 Wei et al. 2024 In addition to several parameters assumptions biomass yield lipid productivity specific growth rate etc. considered in the conduct of myriads of life cycle assessment that were initially made based on the findings from laboratory scale and might be very difficult to replicate the data for larger system productions there are constraints for most LCA studies conducted in the available literature among other things con sisted of i lack of incorporation of dynamic physiological delicacies of microalgal growth coupled with integration of mechanistic models ii inappropriate system consideration and well-designed process consid ering multi-facets nature of algal biofuel processes as well as iii lack of transparency and validity of some specific assumptions especially with regards to energy balance in the entire system boundary which is not clearly addressed due to limited availability of commercial algal culti vation plants transparent for technical assessments plants has been an issues of concern for a very long period of time and iv there are various M. Bello et al. Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 2 LCA studies of algae to biofuel process focusing on a specific processing unit but neglecting important factors in the synthesis integration operation control and management stages of the overall production system Slade and Bauen 2013 Chamkalani et al. 2020 Carneiro et al. 2017 . Effectively there is no consistent framework for the conduct of LCA due to variability in key factors influencing the results such as the system boundaries time frame for the assessment may influence the evaluation of greenhouse gas and many environmental factors and sys tems boundary allocation as well as lack of focused area such as a ho listic and comprehensive optimization of algae to biofuel process with full integration of upstream and downstream activities plus environ mental cum economic as well as social and management considerations. 3.2. Material and energy balances Mass and energy balances are starting points for the economic evaluation of biofuel production. The energy balances cover a much wider range of activities such as energy efficiency intensity process emissions and supply chain while material balances encompass material sourcing demand handling disposal land and water management fugitive emissions fleet and logistics. As such the overall energy con sumption must be monitored at different levels of detail with energy management applications. The actual benefits that can in practice be realized by biofuel depend crucially on the energy content and carbon balances which indicate the magnitude of fossil fuel impacts and related greenhouse gas GHG emissions relative to subsequent fossil fuels to current commercial sources of energy. In other words for the assessment of renewable energy sources it is necessary to weigh various conversion processes and biofuel produced with respect to their ability to produce useful work and to identify their impact on the environment bearing in mind that input and output energy are two factors that determine the economic and ecological usefulness of a fuel or its production technol ogy. In fact the sustainability of microalgae production depends on both the energy content of input material and the process pathway Esra Sorguven 2010 Slade and Bauen 2013 Rocca et al. 2015 . Moreover assessing the inputs and outputs are key issues sur rounding the current trends in algal sustainability. A corresponding variance where energy input exceeds energy output energy return on energy invested or EROI can threaten the feasibility of algal biofuel technology. The energy return on investment EROI is a measure of sustainability. EROI is the ratio between the energy from a certain en ergy resource and the exergy spent to obtain that resource. In the case of EROEI 3 is desirable for a fuel to be a sustainable energy source Saad et al. 2019 . Many inputs are required to scale up the production of algal fuels such as constructing the facility chemicals pumps cooling CO2 pipelines filters harvesting centri fuges storage surface structure for open ponds pH salinity extraction and conversion transport recycling water and nutrients and delivering fuels effectively the embodied energy will be critically high. The esti mated EROI for algal biofuels produced in either open ponds or photo bioreactors is 0.13 0.71 Hall et al. 2011 Saad et al. 2019 Sills et al. 2012 . Moreover the detailed design or specification of process equipment can begin only when the material and energy balances are complete and the life cycle assessment LCA is based on science and engineering energy balances coupled with mass balances of unit operation approach rather than LCA on accounting procedure Pfromm et al. 2011 . The most important issues to take into account are the usage of fossil fuels in production and the resultant release of fossil-derived CO2. The minimization of energy inputs incorporated in materials of plant construction nutrients used electricity needed for mixing and pumping and natural gas for drying must be maintained or improved. Moreover waste materials must be recycled to the process and the energy recovered from the waste product Scott et al. 2010 3.3. Scalability Various microalgae production processes have been under investi gation ranging from different types of cultivation methods to harvest ing extraction purification and conversion. There is still much needed research to be conducted in these areas considering the cost and levels of scale achieved in these unit processes Van beilen 2010 . A concrete dependable and reproducible figure is required for each unit process to convert algae to a specific concentration. This has not yet been demonstrated on a commercial scale and thus remains a significant challenge DOE 2010 . Scalability has often recapitulated the incremental production vol ume required to meet the larger demand congruently maintaining effi ciency and quality to a significant level. Most of the sustainability challenges in algal biofuel production centred towards sustaining optimal growth conditions efficient resources supply and effective harvesting techniques at larger scales. Having an algal biofuel constructively competing with fossil fuels and other renewable energy sources as well as cost reduction strategies is highly critical for achieving scalable production. The essential questions here are simply what are the energy and material inputs coupled with the associated cost required for algal cultivation harvesting and or drying process And what are the limits of such requirements Only when these questions have been answered will the process of system engineering plant design begin. These questions will however initially depend on the economics of algal technology such as the cost associated with algal biomass growth harvesting dewatering and extraction. Other economic considerations include capital equipment investment operations and maintenance while project costs may include acquiring permits infrastructure prep arations installation and integration cost of nutrients CO2 distribution utilities components replacement contractor fees labour cost and cost of the land where applicable Singh and Gu 2010 Singh and Olsen 2011 . In synopsis scalability challenges still remain the major obstacles for the speedy commercialization of algal biofuel and are often found in the upstream process which includes the algal selection and cultivation methods the nutrients requirements energy input for maintaining closed photobioreactors water requirements and footprints and sensi tivity of algae towards environmental stressors such as changes in pH water quality and increased concentrations of some chemicals and contaminants. Downstream process scalability issues are associated with efficient harvesting and drying techniques of algal cells effective lipid extraction methodologies algal biodiesel conversion technologies algal biofuel quality and the potential to diversify algal biofuel production from lipid-extracted algae residue Lam et al. 2019 . In addition social considerations include income generation job opportunities healthy conditions for workers and education and access to public service support. Therefore until large-scale systems are built and operated over a number of years many uncertainties will remain. 3.4. Sustainability and regulation Sustainability is the ability of resources to be used in such a way not to be depleted but replenished to meet the needs of today without compromising the needs of tomorrow Lovett et al. 2010 Naik et al. 2010 . The growing interest in the use of algal biofuels has generated yet another issue regarding their sustainable use in the global market. This has resulted from the possibility of negative ecological impacts as well as the socio-economic impacts of GHG emissions. Thus the successful deployment and commercialization of algal biofuels is tied to regulatory frameworks pertaining to National and International guidelines and standards on environmental management systems. More often than not standards such as air emissions land use water usage and discharge as well as safety and health standards on workers are regulated. Govern ment mandates subsidies and tax incentives as well as incentives M. Bello et al. Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 3 promote or hinder the development of algal biofuels. Compliance issues are the major hurdles for algal biofuel producers and form the basis for gaining public and government support. Many governments scientists and others have already recognised the importance of setting standards and certification schemes to main tain the sustainable production of biofuels. The schemes entailed criteria that have to be fulfilled for the certification of a product or production process and the mechanism for its sustainability indication van Dam et al. 2008 . Sustainability objectives are statutory instruments in the UK and biofuels are part of the 2007 RTFO order. The RTFO order is aimed at meeting the 5.75 renewable transport fuel target for 2010 and the 10 target for 2020 in the 2009 European Fuels Directive. The RED is formulated at the EU level to require producers to comply with a set of sustainability criteria to count towards the EU biofuel target. Sustainability criteria of the RTFO include carbon emissions environment agriculture economic activities and sustainable develop ment. On the global scale RSB a multi-stakeholder initiative of the UNEP has also developed sustainability standards for biofuels Lovett et al. 2010 . 3.5. Technical maturity There are many processes involved in the production of algal bio fuels such as culturing harvesting dewatering oil extraction and conversion processes. This set-in motion an overview of the supply chain technology required to derive energy from microalgae as shown in Fig. 1. Thus substantial improvement is highly desirable in microalgal productivity through various technological improvements see Fig. 2 . Additionally numerous options exist for processing algal biomass to the desired end product. This means that different processing scenarios would have evolved and different resource requirements. Therefore the selection of effective processing technology would solely depend on the available resources algae species being cultivated and particularly the maturity of the evolving technology since the classification of biofuels depends on the species used and the existing maturity of the technology. Categorically among other important issues such as resource demand sustainability and scalability the Technology Readiness Level TRL is a significant issue that needs to be considered for the evaluation and integration of algal-based biofuel systems. TRL is a certification scheme which quantifies the maturity levels of evolving technologies and uses a predetermined requirement standard in helping to produce biofuels in a sustainable manner. Under this method a technology is assigned a readiness level from 1 to 9 based on TRL criteria van Dam et al. 2008 . Generally speaking the purpose of timely and accurate technology readiness assessments is to inform management and support decisions as part of the implementation of advanced technology system development projects. The Technology Readiness Levels have been defined to provide a common metric by means of which knowledge of new technology s maturity might be communicated among program executives system developers technology researchers and among individuals from different organizations. The TRL are therefore not linked to a specific technical discipline. In addition the use of TRLs can provide a needed foundation for developing and communicating insight into the risks involved in advancing a new system and its constituent new technology components. In fact algal biofuel technology be its cultivation system e.g. open Fig. 1. Various production harvesting and processing technologies for microalgae bio-refinery. Fig. 2. Systems technology tools in the design of bio-refineries Kokossis and Yang 2010 . M. Bello et al. Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 4 pond closed photobioreactors and or conversion system e.g. trans esterification and lipid extractions processes hydrolysis and thermo chemical conversions such as hydrothermal liquefactions and pyrolysis is still in the development and demonstration stages and its potentials are continually being explored for optimization and large-scale pro duction. The maturity of these evolving technology is intertwined with its scalability which has a direct bearing on efficiency cost-effectiveness and thus sustainability. Algal biofuels have been reported to have environmental benefits may provide a positive energy balance and could improve resource land water and energy management and minimize the ecological footprint of the production pathways Subhadra and Edwards 2010 Ayhan 2009 . However there exist many technical and non-technical issues related to the implementation and large-scale commercializa tion of bio-refineries. Major technical obstacles anticipated are the intertwined biomass and lipid productivity minimum economic returns with maximum cost of production coupled with feedstock supply and logistics. Other technical issues may include production systems opti mization harvesting transportation and storage. 3.6. Economic analysis Economic analysis is the pivot on which the progress of any project depends and is the stepping stone for convincing investors confidence. It is paramount in assessing financial viability and other costs and benefits for operating a project. Several factors came into play when envisaging the sustainability of microalgal biorefinery. The most important factors include the technical input such as algae biomass yield oil content lipid extraction efficiency and conversion cost. These parameters are extremely important because they directly affect eco nomic viability by interceding the productivity of algae biofuel. Other important factors include financial assumptions and or inputs which are critical for economic analysis as they directly affect the final results such as project lifetime discount rate tax and other overhead costs if microalgal venture is being evaluated and the best courses of action is selected. Reducing the cost of production through more efficient microalgal cultivation harvesting extractions and conversion processes needs to be streamlined to make it sustainable and cost-effective as well as competitive with petroleum-based fuels. A multidisciplinary approach involving system biology strain development scale-up pathway an integrated production chain and logistics is required to overcome this issue Zhang et al. 2017 . In the recent decade techno-economic analysis TEA and life cycle assessment LCA gained importance due to their ability to assess the economic feasibility and socio-environmental suitability of the biofuel production from microalgae. These techniques help to prioritize the research s targets and direction to continue and support biofuel and bioenergy production and their performance. The economic aspect of setting up and running the biofuel plant hinders the capabilities of biofuel. Thus tools such as techno-economic analysis provide informa tion about the finances involved in setting up and running the plant for a long time. Also these studies suggest methods for cost reduction of biofuel production. TEA requires a detailed and clear mode of assessment analysis which can enable to identify best biorefinery in view of both technically and economically. However most of the literature on techno-economic assessment follows a set of guidelines that were previously imple mented in previous studies. Operational labour maintenance and capital costs are included in the techno-economic assessment this methodology precisely estimates net present value NPV and accord ingly minimum fuel selling price MFSP are calculated. Along with MFSP and NPV the parameters such as discounted cash flow and sensitivity analysis are also considered for a fail-proof decision on economic viability and play a crucial part in assessing the sustainability of the biorefinery. Commercial or open-source software such as Aspen Plus or SuperPro Designer can be used for detailed process flow sheets for the biorefinery under study. Juneja and Murthy 2017 studied the techno-economic analysis of the hydrothermal liquefaction of Chlorella vulgaris C. vulgaris which has shown a high potential for wastewater treatment during its growth. It has a high growth rate with resistance to high concentrations of gasses such as CO2 SOX and NOX which makes it to grow in open ponds with waste water as its nutrient source and flue gasses as its carbon source. This process model was developed for incoming wastewater of 227 million litres day using SuperPro Designer software. A 20 algal con centration was used in this study and optimal HTL process conditions were used for maximum oil yield 37 . Renewable diesel biofuel costs around 6.62 Gallon. Ranganathan and Savithri 2019 studied liquid fuel production from wastewater-based microalgae. This model consists of 800 Million Litres M L day of wastewater input for the treatment process including pri mary treatment grit removal and sludge sedimentation secondary treatment activated sludge process and tertiary treatment. The treated water was used for microalgae production in open raceway ponds. A hydrothermal liquefaction process was employed to convert waste water-based microalgae to liquid fuels. This procedure happens at a certain temperature of 350OC and at 20 MPa the preheated algal slurry was pumped to the HTL reactor at subcritical conditions. The algal slurry in the HTL reactor converts into gas aqueous biooil organic phase and solid residue ash and char under the subcritical hydrothermal condi tion. The HTL effluent after solid residue separation is sent to a three-phase separator to separate liquid organic and gas phases. The process was simulated using Aspen Plus software in which all the ma terial and energy flows in an integrated wastewater-based biofuel pro duction plant were carried out. Soave- Redlich-Kwong SRK thermodynamic equation of state was used to model phase equilibria thermodynamic property for each component in different phases. The size of the equipment was determined using the results of a steady-state simulation which was used to compute the mass and energy balances. The minimum selling price MSP of liquid fuels was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis approach which is the price of fuel determined under zero NPV. The MSP of liquid fuels was calculated as 4.3 USD GGE. The several products produced by this process diesel jet fuel gasoline and H2 are normalized based on their greater heating values to create gallon gasoline equivalent GGE . Ranganathan 2023 studied the techno-economic analysis of renewable fuel produced from sewage sludge through the hydrothermal liquefaction process. This process includes wastewater treatment for which sewage was collected a hydrothermal liquefaction unit for bio fuel production hydro processing unit for crude oil upgradation and hydrogen production. The author studied 800 million litres day wastewater treatment capacity and subsequent renewable fuel produc tion. During wastewater treatment grit removal and sludge sedimen tation were considered as primary treatment and activated sludge treatment as a secondary process the primary and secondary sludges were dewatered and pumped into an HTL reactor for biooil production and by using a 3-phase separator biooil was separated and sent into hydro processing unit for upgradation to renewable fuel and subsequent hydrogen production through steam reforming method. A steady-state process simulation was performed to observe mass and energy flow through the process components of the plant. The simulations were performed using process flow commercial sheeting software Aspen Plus. Soave-Redlich-Kwong SRK thermodynamic phase equilibrium state was considered for each component during the simulation. Energy and mass flowrates were utilized for the calculation of sizing of equipment with the help of Aspen Plus Economic Analyser APEA software for the calculation of equipment sizing which is necessary for calculation cap ital expenditure CAPEX and operating expenditure OPEX of the plant under study. CAPEX and OPEX were utilized to calculate the MSP of renewable fuel using discounted cash flow analysis and to ease com parison of biorefinery Nth plant assumption is considered. Plant lifespan assumed to be 20 years tax rate of 40 10 Internal Rate of Return M. Bello et al. Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 5 IRR and 330 total operational days. The MFSP is 4.04 US GGE 1.15 US litre . A life cycle assessment was performed on the hydrothermal lique faction of Chlorella vulgaris C. vulgaris for producing renewable diesel Juneja and Murthy 2017 . A well-to-pump cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment was performed for the production of renewable diesel RD using GREET. Energy used for the production of RD was 241.6 MJ per 1000 MJ of energy produced which is 80 lower than the mineral diesel formed from crude oil. 110 kg of CO2 equivalent per 1000 MJ 3.73 Kg CO2 eq. Lt. RD of energy produced greenhouse gasses GHG is emitted from RD. When well-to-wheel cradle-to-grave is considered LCA has performed a total GHG emission of 31 kg CO2eq per 1000 MJ RD. GHG emission during the algae growth harvesting stage is nega tive 111.5 kg CO2eq. per 1000 MJ RD due to CO2 sequestration. A life cycle assessment LCA was performed on a biodiesel pro duction plant using freshwater microalgae Chlorella Vulgaris C. Vul garis in a hybrid cultivation system Adesanya et al. 2014 . This system is a two-stage process that couples both raceway ponds with airlift tubular photobioreactors for increased biomass growth and lipid accu mulation. Based on the 1ton of biodiesel produced have around 42 savings in GWP as compared to fossil fuels and 38 savings in Fossil energy requirements FER as compared to fossil fuels derived diesel these results show that microalgae-derived fuels have less environ mental impacts as compared to the fossil fuel derived diesel. Maga 2016 discussed the LCA for the municipal wastewater-based microalgae biorefinery. GaBi software was used for this study on LCA. A functional unit of 1m3 was considered to analyse the environmental impacts of the biomethane to be used as an alternative vehicle fuel 1 MJ CNG was used as the functional unit. A cradle-to-grave approach was used in this study. The energy balance of all gas plants was performed and 50 30 000 MJ day of primary energy consumed by algal bio refinery was observed for only 5000 m3 output. Greenhouse gas emis sion from wastewater-treated algae biorefinery was observed to be 0.28 kg CO2 eq. m3 and GHG emissions from regular wastewater treatment plants was around 0.47 kg CO2 eq. m3 shows a 40 reduction in GHG emissions due to the implementation of the algal biorefinery concept. The global Warming Potential GWP of 1 MJ biomethane used as a vehicular fuel was calculated as 0.02 kg CO2 eq. MJ and GWP for con ventional CNG as a vehicular passenger fuel calculated as 0.08 kg CO2 eq. MJ. All gas approaches for biomethane formation protect the envi ronment from fossil depletion ozone depletion minerals and metal depletion. More land requirement 10 ha for the construction of HRAP High-Rate Algal Ponds requires more space than a conventional wastewater treatment system. Particulate matter emissions from the transportation of residues and exhaust from biomass boilers also contribute to the impacts on human health along with GHG emissions see Table 1 . 3.7. Commercial industries There are numerous companies involved in the algal to biofuel process utilizing various methods such as open pond cultivation hy drothermal processes fermentation process genetic engineering as well as controlled environment systems to produce algal biofuels commer cially. These companies are listed with their production methods adopted for commercial production as in Table 2 below. 3.8. Nutrient minimizing methods for large scale production of algae The potential for nutrient recycling is thought to be essential for the economic development of large-scale microalgae cultivation. Imple mentation of various nutrient recycling minimizing steps could improve resource efficiency and enhance the sustainability of the process. Onsite recovery from biomass and waste stream utilization should be integrated and maximized to reduce fertilizer requirements avoid competition with food production and overcome other sustainability issues. Different approaches have been utilized to minimize nutrients for sus tainable cultivation of algal biomass such as 1 nutrient recovery sys tems from spent algae biomass and wastewater nutrient technologies 2 close-loop cultivation system where nutrients are continuously recycled within the system 3 nutrient balancing systems to monitor the efficient utilization of nutrient so as to minimize excess accumulation 4 using efficient harvesting techniques such as flocculation and centrifugation to concentrate algae biomass and retain nutrient for the purpose of recy cling and 5 the integration with nutrient recycling technology from the residual biomass such as the biological process that involves Anaerobic digestion and various Hydrothermal treatment processes is necessary to obtain a sustainable production of algal biomass Arora et al. 2023 Barbera et al. 2018 . Hydrothermal treatments have been used in the conversion of algal biomass which is fraught with the possibility of processing wet micro algae directly 5 20 solid content avoiding the energy-costly drying step. Different hydrothermal processes such as hydrothermal gasifica tion HTG hydrothermal liquefaction HTL hydrothermal Carbon ization HTC and flash hydrolysis can be used depending on the operating conditions to generate an aqueous phase AP rich in nutri ents which therefore has the potential to be recycled as cultivation medium for algal growth. Anaerobic digestion AD which is a commercially developed technology that involves the biological con version of complex organic matter into biogas and methane has been proven feasible using both whole biomass WB and the residue remaining after lipids extraction LEA for the cultivation of algae biomass Arora et al. 2023 . Moreover different strategies which include direct recycling the use of AD liquid digestate as well as an aqueous phase from hydrothermal treatments have been employed to recycle nutrient obtained from either AD and or HT processes. However their bio-availability utilization efficiency and possible toxicity effects need to be carefully evaluated.

Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 6 Various life cycle assessment LCA studies have been conducted to evaluate the associated implications of nutrient demand on the eco nomic and environmental issues of commercial-scale microalgae culti vation Bello et al. 2017 Venteris et al. 2014 Pate et al. 2011 . Assessment of nutrient supply and resource sustainability for Chlorella growth comparing various technologies and their impact on the opti mization of algal biofuel production have been conducted by Wigmosta et al. 2011 . A regional-scale resource analysis of open pond systems and site-specific analysis for a photobioreactor has been investigated by Pate et al. 2011 and Quinn et al. 2012 and concluded that the resource sustainability is potentially a serious limitation for a successful deployment of the algal biofuel industry. However most of the studies conducted on nutrient recycling are obtained at a laboratory scale mostly in batch operation mode. There fore technological efforts should be directed towards scaling up the processes considered and optimizing the performances under contin uous operation mode to improve nutrient recovery and energetic profitability before industrial-scale applications can be effectively implemented Arora et al. 2023 . The feasibility of integrating waste water with microalgae cultivation as a source of water and nutrients for microalgae growth as well as effective wastewater treatment has been established by Arora et al. 2023 Barbera et al. 2018 and Rosch et al. 2012 but such studies have not extended results to scalability. Despite the knowledge gained through previous techno-economic and life cycle analysis and resource assessments a need remains for a thorough evaluation of the nutrient demand of large-scale biofuel production. 3.9. Sustainable designed and supply routes of algal biorefinery The development of microalgae upstream activities and downstream processing has set in motion complex and enormous decision-making problems connecting a distinctive array of process development that needs to be faced boldly and systematically. Several key issues are considered such as cultivations systems optimal location waste water utilization for resource efficiency harvesting systems techniques optimization energy use processing logistics local transportation supply chain integration and sustainability metric Yadala et al. 2020 . Bringing issues of bio-refinery design configuration thermodynamics process integration processing paths re-engineering initiatives holistic evaluation of techno-economic trade-offs and supply chain integration will champion the basis for an effective economic representation. Kokossis and Yang 2010 2010 have reported some significant fea tures that represent the information flow that can be used to assess new technologies and re-engineering initiatives coupled with designing an integrated bio-refinery depicted in Table 3. For instance a conceptual energy-driven biorefinery considering a four-platform configuration biogas biomethane oil electricity and heat biorefinery using algae for biodiesel biomethane electricity heat and glycerine Omega 3 and fertilizer can thus be demonstrated as in Fig. 3 below. 3.10. Upstream technologies 3.10.1. Microalgae cultivation Open and closed systems are often used for the cultivation of microalgae. Open ponds simply recapitulate open tank or natural ponds that grow profusely in suitable climatic conditions and adequate nutri ents with minimal control of the environment that require a certain level of construction and maintenance. Microalgae biomass cultivation is presently carried out in an open system for commercial purposes. This may stem from the basic reason that open ponds are easier to build and operate less expensive and more durable with a large production ca pacity susceptible to commercialization in comparison with closed systems. To overcome the technical and biological difficulties faced by open systems photo-bioreactors are now developed. They are culture systems for phototrophs and have the capacity to enhance the cultivation of microalgae with higher efficiency and biomass concentration due to combined enhancement of a thin boundary layer and short light dark fluctuations at high turbulences. The provision of cultivation under different environmental conditions without contamination water loss by evaporation and more rigorous process control is a high priority of closed photo-bioreactors. Closed photo-bioreactors have the ability to maintain a consistency in biomass and liquid productivity and allow the cultivation of a single strain in an optimum growth condition coupled with extremely process control. Xu et al. 2011 have listed the following issues for effective culture systems a Effective illumination area b optimal gas-liquid transfer c easy to operate d low contamination e low capital and production cost and f Minimal land requirement. The major issues surrounding the technology and services of culti vation systems are. Table 2 List of the industries involved in algal biofuel production.

Various studies have been conducted to describe the tech niques involved in cultivating algae Brennan and Owende 2010 Mata et al. 2010 Mayers et al. 2014 Kenny and Flynn 2015 . However a decision has to be reached on the type of cultivation platform to use. However the distinguishing features of the bioreactors used in culti vating algae for biorefinery applications are mostly related to one of the following issues 1 throughput 2 energy inputs 3 cost range 4 design issue 5 servicing required 6 nutrients demand 7 material for construction and 8 scale-up issues. Effectively the production plat form required for microalgae bio-refinery is a necessity for the economic and environmental sustainability of biofuel production from specific microalgae species. Furthermore and for an ideal cultivations system the following requirement are necessary for pond optimum perfor mance i has an effective illumination area ii utilization of optimal liquid gas transfer iii. maintaining a low contamination level iv. very simple to operate v . has low capital and operating cost and vi. utili zation of minimum land surface area Lam et al. 2019 Halder and Azad 2019 .

Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 8 technological advancement of various cultivation technologies issues are discussed below. 3.10.2. Open pond technical prospects The open pond production platform is currently the most common production system used for microalgae growth. It is popularly described as a raceway shallow or circular pond culture system that is currently employed in most countries of the world USA China India Thailand and Israel for the cultivation of microalgae. Environmental conditions land and water and the location of the ponds are an important factor to determine the success and the type of pond to be selected the intrinsic properties of algae species being cultivated and the amount of light for the photosynthesis process Harun et al. 2010 . Lee 2001 reported that the severity of the culture environment has made it possible to grow only a limited number of resistant algal species such as Dunaliella-high salinity Spirulina-high alkalinity and Chlorella-high nutrition . Generally open systems entertain large areas for cultivation relatively easy to build and operate with low energy input requirements Brennan and Owende 2010 Amaro et al. 2011 . The biomass productivity of an open system ranges between 0.1 and 0.5 g L Lardon et al. 2009 . However open pond systems are associated with some difficulties concerning contamination requirements of large areas of land efficient CO2 utilization poor mixing excessive evaporative losses temperature and light control issues and difficulty in growing algae over long pe riods of time Brennan and Owende 2010 Chisti 2007 Richmond 2008 Singh and Olsen 2011 Williams and Laurens 2010 . Open sys tems are associated with difficulties in maintaining their stable envi ronmental conditions due to temperature fluctuations and achievable cell density is hard to attain due to shading effects Amaro et al. 2011 . The raceway pond is constructed as an endless loop in which the culture is circulated by paddle wheels. They are lined with plastic or cement 0.2 0.5 ha in size and are about 15 35 cm deep to ensure adequate exposure to light. Paddle wheels provide the motive force while water nutrients and algae circulate around a racetrack. The construction and design of an open pond system depends essentially on local conditions and available materials at disposal. Materials for con struction of the side walls range from simple clay to cement and to expensive PVC glass fibers or polyurethane. The materials used to build walls bottom and lining determine the pond s performance viability and cost implication. For the lining most commercial plants use long- life plastic membranes of 1 2 mm thick UV resistant PVC or poly ethylene sheets Mata et al. 2010 . The performance as well as the durability depend upon the material used to design raceway ponds. The biomass productivity of an open system is reported between 0.1 and 0.5 g l Lardon et al. 2009 . Brennan and Owende 2010 reported various inconsistencies associ ated with the productivities of raceway ponds. The biomass production rates of 30 37 tonnes per year using data from producing biomass dry weight ranging from 8.2 gm-2 to 25gm-2 and biomass concentration amounting to 1 g l to 10 g l. It has been reported cultivation of Microalgae uses shallow water depth of 0.2 0.3 m areal dimensions range from 0.5 to 1 ha for raceway to greater than 200 ha for extensive ponds in Australia for D. salina production. The use of water depends on the intensity of operation and CO2 is added due to its stripping-out effect under control pH-stat. Flocculation and or centrifugation can be used for harvesting operations Greenwell et al. 2010 . Optimization with respect to raceway configuration operation and cost is very important for microalgal biofuel production Slade and Bauen 2013 . Khoo et al. 2011 reported an energy input of 1.152 MJ per kg of dry biomass output and an estimated energy amount of 4.608 MJ kg of biodiesel for raceway system. The total life cycle energy for the culti vation of microalga Nannochloropis sp. in the raceway pond in Brazil was reported by Jorquera et al. 2010 as 45 GJ year for 100 tonne year algal biomass. Moreover 6.5 GJ tonne biodiesel was a total life cycle energy associated with production of biodiesel from fresh alga Chlorella vulgaris in the raceway in UK Lardon et al. 2009 . In the open system Nitrogen is removed during biomass growth and CO2 is diffused to the atmosphere. Photo-bioreactors have superior quality upon open systems in terms of nitrogen biomass uptake and organic matter utilization for biomass growth via CO2 uptake Fern andez et al. 2012. With the exception of CO2 nutrients requirement is assumed to follow stoichiometric based on carbon nitrogen phos phorus C N P composition of 10 10 1. The requirement is based on elemental composition rather than nitrogen fertilizers since using Ammonia nutrients requirement attracts upstream energy balance because they rely on the manufacture of ammonia Barbera et al. 2018 . 3.10.3. Photobioreactor technical prospects Photobioreactor PBR systems are developed with the motive of reducing some technical difficulties associated with open systems coupled with enhancing the biological and physiological characteristics of a particular grown microalgae species. PBR culture platforms are flexible and have the capacity to manipulate variables and essentially control parameters such as light temperature nutrients and pH compared to the open platforms. Hence the cultivation of microalgae with greater efficiency and biomass concentration is due to the rigorous process control and the provision of cultivation under different envi ronmental conditions without contamination and water loss by evapo ration. Different designs of PBR systems exist with distinctive throughput based on the mode of operation and design. Efficiency of photo-bioreactors is also assessed based on nutrient removal organic matter utilization and biomass chemical profile. Closed system tubular photo-bioreactor showed a higher cell N content compared to open system. The different designs tested in the laboratory or in a pilot scale include a various forms of tubular reactors b horizontal vertical in clined or spiral reactors and c annular reactors and arrangement of plastic bags. However these designs are associated with varying scaling- up costs and inconsistent reports in terms of cost and productivity Amaro et al. 2011 Tubular reactors are cheap and have large illumination area with good biomass productivity. Vertical bubble columns and airlift cylinders have high mass transfer good mixing and low energy consumption with a good surface volume ratio. Vertical plate is much better in terms of productivity and ease of operations than bubble columns. A biomass productivity of 1.9 g L-1 d-1 for continuous batch operation in tubular PBRs was also reported Mata et al. 2010 . Moreover airlift PBR design is more suitable for carbon sequestration from flue gas with effective gas transfer coupled with low hydrodynamic stress and ease of control. Integrating airlift with tubular PBR systems will produce interesting features of surface to volume ratio Kumar et al. 2011 . However PBR systems have some limitations in terms of cost overheating oxygen accumulation due to CO2 depletion and oxygen saturation. Addition ally fouling affects light intensity and causes abrasion leading to a shorter PBR lifespan. Even though PBR systems are more effective in terms of nutrients and biomass utilization achieving optimal growth requires correct composition Carvalho et al. 2006 Fern andez et al. 2012 . Open systems are often thought to be used for large-scale outdoor productions in the near future despite the advantages of closed photo bioreactors over the open system. The higher cell density and biomass productivity attainable in a closed system may not compensate for its excessive capital and operating costs Mata et al. 2010 . The most important parameter to assess larger photo-bioreactor design is areal productivity which is reported as an average 12 14 g dw m 2 day-1. High oil species of microalgae culture in growth- optimized conditions of photo-bioreactors have the ability to produce 19 000 to 57 0000 L of microalgal oil per acre per year Lam et al. 2019 . Photo-bioreactors have higher efficiency and biomass concen tration 2 5 g L shorter harvest time 2 4 weeks and higher surface to volume ratio 25 125 m than open ponds Wang et al. 2014 . Lehr and Posten 2009 reported that biomass yields up to 200 t per hectare and year could be achievable with improved photobioreactors. PBR can be operated in batch semi-continuous or continuous systems coupled with M. Bello et al. Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 9 incorporated automation and feedback subsystems to stabilize the in ternal conditions Greenwell et al. 2010 . A newly designed tubular or flat plate PBR configuration offers shorter optical paths under illumi nation Lam et al. 2019 . Airlift photo-bioreactor is the most promising reactor for carbon sequestration from the flue gas with characteristics qualities of high gas transfer low hydrodynamic stress and ease of control. More desirable qualities of surface to volume ratio and scal ability will be recorded on integrating a tubular loop with airlift Lam et al. 2019 Kumar et al. 2011 . Ideally the auxiliary energy needed for mixing and gas transfer should not exceed 2 W m2 and biomass concentration should be 20 g l at photobioreactor cost of 40 m2 Lehr and Posten 2009 . However 2.5W m2 with biomass 118 t ha calculated from energy balance and Areal energy harvest of 7.5W m2 for bubbled and airlift photo-bioreactor and 50 70 W m3 for flat plate reactor was reported Lehr and Posten 2009 . Fern andez et al. 2012 reported photosyn thetic efficiency PE ratio that relates the energy produced as biomass with regard to the supplied energy as irradiance as efficient for both closed 9.3 and open systems 8.6 . Total life cycle energy of 199.5GJ tonne of biodiesel was obtained for the hypothetical produc tion of biodiesel from Chlorella vulgaris cultivated in a conventional tubular photobioreactor in UK Stephenson et al. 2010 . Singapore experienced 0.56 MJ cultivation + harvesting + dewatering total life cycle energy of hypothetical integrated PBR-raceway for the production of microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. conversion of microalgal lipids to biodiesel via trans-esterification Khoo et al. 2011 . A Net Energy Ratio NER of 2.38 was obtained for offshore microalgae cultivation for biofuel production via flocculation Singh et al. 2014 For the development of a photoautotrophic production system in closed photo-bioreactors achieving optimal growth requires correct composition. An ideal mixture is nutrient sufficient so as to check minimal cost and waste since the process of optimized media is specie and product specific. The use of nitrogen phosphorus potassium cal cium magnesium and Sulphur is sustained thus the application of phosphate is no longer sustainable due to the upstream energy cost of ammonia production and environmental implications. The quantity and quality of nutrients to be used in running a photo-bioreactor is based on elemental balance analysis and this implies that nutrient recycling is becoming an important issue Stephens et al. 2010 . Now the life-cycle quantities of nutrients without harvest water recycling are nitrogen 0.33 phosphorus 0.71 potassium 0.58 magnesium 0.27 and Sulphur 0.5 kg kg-biodiesel. However the amount of these nutrients reduces by approximately 55 when the harvested water is 100 recycled. Using sea wastewater can reduce nitrogen usage by 94 and eliminates the need of potassium magnesium and Sulphur. Decreasing the recycling rate of water automatically increases nutrient usage Yang et al. 2011 . Efficiency of photo-bioreactors is also assessed based on nutrient removal organic matter utilization and biomass chemical profile. Closed system tubular photo-bioreactor showed a higher cell N content compared to the open system. In the open system Nitrogen is removed during biomass growth and CO2 is diffused to the atmosphere. Photobioreactors have superior quality upon open systems in terms of nitrogen biomass uptake and organic matter utilization for biomass growth via CO2 uptake Fern andez et al. 2012 Fern andez et al. 2012 It looks so easy though very difficult to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of open ponds with closed ponds stemming from the interplay of various factors as there are various reporting productivity conventions such as volumetric productivity which is defined as the biomass productivities per unit reactor volume gC m-2 d-1 and areal productivities which refers to as the biomass produced per unit ground area occupied by the reactor gC m-2 d-1 Mata et al. 2010 . Biomass productivity however depends on the area illuminated being the most significant factor and can be deduced based on any combination of depth optical volume and concentration provided the depth and or con centration are enough for optical extinction to occur. Therefore optical depths and dilution rates a factor of cell concentration are important bioreactor design and operation criteria that are crucial for commercial purposes Flynn et al. 2010 . Greater optical depth of the reactor re quires less space for installation with a lower temperature fluctuations and evaporation losses. While lower dilution rate will create a dense culture with lower expense of growth media preparation effectively decreasing cell concentration and de-watering costs. A high dilution rate will result in low concentration leading to lower productivity as well. On the downside higher optical depths promote light limitation while low dilution rates are linked to low production rates Flynn et al. 2010 Malek et al. 2015 . Therefore appropriate optimal dilution rates and optical depths 0.1 m considering local climate are thus required for the balancing system areal and volumetric productivity Flynn et al. 2010 Kenny and Flynn 2015 Moreover volumetric productivity is only higher in closed ponds than in the open system with no glaring advantages in terms of areal productivity over the open system Richmond 2008 Mata et al. 2010 . However for a biorefinery application that recapitulates optimal commercial operations it is paramount to balance areal productivity and volumetric productivity to maximum levels so as to maximize land use minimize resources water and nutrients consumption and har vesting costs Flynn et al. 2010 Kenny and Flynn 2015 . Balancing volumetric productivity with areal productivity through manipulating pond depth and volume parameters has been demonstrated by Kenny and Flynn 2015 concluding that efficient biofuel productions require the combinations of a fast-growing strain and nutrient deficiency which can be promoted by shallow optical depth and relatively slow dilution rates. These aforementioned differences generated interest in comparing the throughput of open systems with closed reactors listed in Table 4. 3.11. Downstream technologies 3.11.1. Harvesting technologies and their technical prospects Microalgae are the most rapidly growing algae species that are difficult to harvest because it is very small 0.3 5 g l and often motile unicells 2 40 μm see Table 5 . Hence there is a strong relationship between the development of the harvesting technique and the selection of algae species for mass culture. Moreover the selection of harvesting techniques is dependent on the properties of microalgae such as density and size which determines how easily the species can be settled and filtered coupled with the value of the desired product. The cost of harvesting recovery of algal biomass is also a challenging issue because of a very low mass fraction in culture broth and negative polarity and thus accounts for 20 30 of the total cost of production Chen et al. 2011 Brennan and Owende 2010 . The aim of harvesting is to obtain slurry with at least 2 7 of algal suspension on a dry matter basis . Singh et al. 2011 . In short the main stimulating engineering demand rests in reducing the energetic consumptions of separating or isolating the microalgal cells from the culture medium which ultimately de termines the cost of production. The cost of harvesting is fundamental to microalgal biomass production accounting for 20 30 of the total cost. After aqueous cultivation of microalgae dewatering to produce dry algal biomass is a preparatory stage to deliver algae to the next stage Khoo et al. 2011 . The aim of harvesting is to obtain slurry with at least 2 7 of algal suspension on a dry matter basis and can be categorized as Singh et al. 2011 . 1. Bulk harvesting the aim is to separate the microalgal biomass from the bulk suspension. Using this method the total solid matter can reach 2 7 using a concentration factor of 100 800 times applying flocculation flotation or gravity sedimentation Brennan and Owende 2010 . 2. Thickening filtration centrifugation and ultrasonic aggregation harvesting techniques are used in this method to concentrate the slurry. The process is more energy-intensive than bulk harvesting Brennan and Owende 2010 . M. Bello et al. Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 10 The main harvesting techniques for microalgae are. Filtration and related-mechanical harvesting using filtration by means of strong membranes such as microscreens and microstainers. Settling and sedimentation-gravity and centrifugal sedimentation. Chemical Methods-chemical and or biological harvesting such as by means of flocculants e.g. auto-flocculation chemical coagulation inorganic coagulants organic flocculants combined flocculation electrocoagulation and ultrasonic aggregation. Centrifugation-algae can also be harvested using centrifugation. Flotation-froth floatation is a method whereby the water and algae are aerated into froth with the algae then removed from the water and Table 4 Technical prospect and areas for development of microalgae cultivation systems. Technologies Design issues Areas for development Scalability issues Servicing required Cost range Cultivation system Flat Plate photo- bioreactors Large Illumination for surface area suitable for outdoor cultures good light path readily tempered low oxygen build up good for algae immobilization and possess good biomass productivities and high densities for photoautotrophic cells 80 g l Hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics Overall mass transfer coefficient Liquid velocity Gas velocity Solid velocity Mixing Gas hold-up Difficulties in controlling culture temperature scale up require compartments and support materials and possibility of hydrodynamic stress to some algal strain Increasing the height and the number of compartments. Oxygen O2 removal for horizontal tubular design with high surface to volume ratio is required due to tendency to strong axial gradients of CO2 depletion and O2 saturation. Wall growth and dirt removal reduces light intensity and causes abrasion leading to shorter PBR life span. Cooling is needed b immersing tubes in cooling bath and or b spraying water The investment cost of photo-bioreactors is estimated to cost 40 t. However algal biomass is traded for more than 5000 t. Vertical Photo- bioreactors Attainment of substantial increase in radial movement of fluid that is necessary for improved light-dark cycling. high mass transfer low energy consumption relatively cheap possibility for up scaling good mixing with low sheer stress easily tempered readily sterilized good for immobilization of algae leading to less photo-oxidation and photo- inhibition effects Fouling some degree of wall growth small illumination surface area requirement of large land surface to accommodate a large number of unit split reactors and construction requires sophisticated materials Increasing the diameter and the large illumination surface area Tubular photo- bioreactors large illumination surface area fairly good biomass productivities and relatively cheap and suitability for outdoor cultures. Water losses due to high evaporation. Limitation on the Length of tubes with potential O2 build- up CO2 depletion photo- inhibition gradients of dissolved oxygen and CO2 along tubes and pH gradients that would lead to the frequent re-carbonation of the culture that will attract increase in cost for algal production. Increasing the length of the tubes Open Pond Short light path lengths 20 m3 per day centrifugation is more economical owing to continuous membrane replacement Brennan and Owende 2010 . Microalgae and Cyanobacteria posed an outstanding filtration challenge because most strains considered for energy feedstock have cell diameters less than 10 μm rgy.gov. Conventional filtration process is suitable for harvesting rela tively large 70 μm microalgae such as Coelastrum and Spiruli. It cannot be used for microalgae species 30 μm like Scenedesmus Dunaliella and Cholorella Brennan and Owende 2010 Menegazzo and Fonseca 2019 Sedimentation is applicable to open pond systems and usually with algae that have high intrinsic sedimentation rates in the water treatment process. Settling characteristics is a function of the density and radius of algae cells and sedimentation velocity as defined by Stokes law. Gravity sedimentation is mainly applied to harvesting microalgae in wastewater treatment because of the large volumes treated and the low value of the biomass generated Brennan and Owende 2010 . Gravity sedimentation is simple with low-cost energy. Sedimentation is a simple and very low process 0.1 2.6cmh-1 that can t be maintained at high-temperature environment Greenwell et al. 2010 . Gravity sedimentation is suit able to large microalgae ca. 70 μm such as Spirulina. For poorer sedimentation force flocculation is induced through the addition of chemicals or culture flocculation. But centrifugal sedimentation requires high energy cost higher maintenance requirements and harvesting ef ficiency of 95 and an increase in slurry concentration by up to 150 times for 15 total suspended solids is technically feasible. Flotation process by sedimentation is however very fast it requires few minutes for sedimentation. Capital and operating cost are also low but the ef ficiency is poor in shallow-depth ponds Singh et al. 2011 Brennan and Owende 2010 Wang et al. 2013 . Following the poor sedimentation properties of some algae strains due to inherent sizes and density chemical methods of harvesting can be used successfully for harvesting purposes. Flocculation is the collection of dispersed particles into an aggregated mass as a result of pH adjust ment usually involving chemical additives. If aggregation is a result of electrolyte addition is regarded as coagulation whereas aggregation as a result of polymer addition is termed as flocculation. Various flocculation methods may include Auto-flocculation bio-flocculation and Chemical coagulation. Chemical additives such as carbonates and hydroxides NaOH can induce physiochemical reactions between algae and pro mote auto-flocculation as a result of carbonate precipitation in elevated pH effectively depleting photosynthetic CO2. Culturing microalgae with another microorganism that promotes sedimentation can also induce bio-flocculation. An example is the use of microbial flocculants for harvesting mass culture of Chlorella vulgaris from Paenibacillys sp. AM49 was identified Chen et al. 2011 . Organic inorganic and poly electrolyte flocculants can be added in various solid-liquid separation processes to distinctive types of microalgae. Addition of inorganic co agulants such as iron aluminium or iron-based coagulants will disrupt the established microalgae system to enable harvesting. Organic flocculants can induce efficient flocculation of fresh water at low dosages between 1 and 10 mg l. Naturally organic substance such as chitosan polymer of glucosamine that is used for water treatment is also used as a flocculant with varied concentrations 40 mg l to 150 mg l in different algal strains Tetraselmis chui Thalassiosira pseudonana and Chaetoceros muelleri respectively due to its non-toxicity effect. Cationic polyelectrolyte and aluminium sulphate are the most promising and potentially tested flocculants. Non-ionic and anionic polyelectrolytes are regarded as ineffective flocculants due to electrostatic repulsion in teractions resulting in a bridging mechanism. The flocculants should be non-toxic inexpensive and effective in low concentrations and should have a positive effect on further downstream processing. Advantages of flocculation include the method is relatively cheap and contains high volume processing. While its disadvantages are the low solids contents of the biomass harvest 1 000K s short residence time 0.5 1s and very fine particles 100 MW . Sulphur emissions of 0.05-0.2 wt are reported upon direct combustion of biomass used for domestic stoves and boilers Raheem et al. 2015 . It is reported that a LCA of coal-algae co-firing could lead to lower GHG emissions and air pollution Goyal et al. 2008 Kosowska- Kosowska-Golachowska and Luckos 2022 Naik et al. 2010 . In another study a life-cycle assess ment LCA showed CO2 emissions can be decreased in conventional coal-firing power plants when even 1 of coal consumption is substituted by dried microalgae. have asserted that the direct combus tion strategy is expected to amplify negative emissions of microalgal energy systems through high energy yield and CO2 fixation which were confirmed by BP and CFP respectively. 3.11.5.2. Biochemical conversions. Chemical trans-esterification is a conversion technology that is employed to convert triacylglycerols extracted from algae biomass to fatty acid methyl esters FAME which is simply a displacement of an alcohol from an ester by another alcohol under the influences of supercritical fluids enzymatic acid-catalysed or alkali-catalysed Costa and De Morais 2011 DoE 2010 . Following M. Bello et al. Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 17 transesterification reaction the two phases glycerine and esters that are produced are separated by evaporation decanting and centrifuging. The processing routes used different heating systems and catalysts such as acid-catalysed H2SO4 HCL or H3PO4 and base-catalysed methanol ethanol and sodium ethanolate . Heating systems include microwave which increases the kinetics of esterification Refaat and El Sheltawy 2008 . But Motasemi and Ani 2012 reported that microwave pro cessing may be cost-intensive. Other methods of heating that may reduce the reaction time reaction temperature and energy input include ultrasonic and cavitation methods even though achieving scalable production via ultrasonic devices requires significant research and innovations DoE 2010 . Another processing route to convert biomass into green diesel fuels that are compatible with petroleum-derived diesel fuels is also focused on the esterification of oils with methanol to produce fatty methyl esters FAME . The process uses hydro-treating of vegetable oil that is based on catalytic saturation hydrodeoxygenation decarboxylation and hydro- isomerization. This technology is applicable for a variety of bio-oil feedstock to produce an isoparaffin-rich diesel aromatic and sulphur- free substitute with a very high cetane blending value and good cold flow properties. The higher quality diesel is readily blended with diesel fuel and therefore does not depend on process configuration and or feed origin in contrast to fatty methyl esters Naik et al. 2010 . Amin 2009 reported the achievable efficient conversion of triglycerides to biodiesel 98 and indicated that the produced biodiesel can be compatible with conventional petroleum derived diesel with a much lower cold filter plugging point of-11 in comparison with that of fuel diesel. Microalgal species Chlorella and Botrycoccus can reach up to 50 and 80 lipid productivity respectively and thus can be excellent sources of biodiesel. Biofuel from microalgal C. protothecoides and Microcytic aeruginosa has calorific values of 30 MJ kg and 29 MJ kg due to their high carbon and hydrogen content and low oxygen content which indicates that the level of stability for biofuel-obtained microalgae is high compared to biofuel from the plant Naik et al. 2010 . Costa and De Morais 2011 reported mean annual productivity of microalgal biomass in a tropical climate region as 1.53 kg m 3 day-1 with a mean 30 of lipids extracted from the biomass the concentration per hectare of the total area is around 123.0 m3 for 90.0 of the 365 days of a year. He thus calculated the yield of biodiesel from microalgae as 98.4 m3 ha-1. And suggested a possible scenario even if the concentration of lipids in the microalgal biomass was 15.0 of dry weight for the production of 5.4 billion m3 of biodiesel an area of approximately 5.4 Mha must be calculated which represents only 3.0 of the area currently used for the cultivation of plants for biodiesel. Microalgal anaerobic digestion AD is a process very similar to the intent of biogas generation. AD is the conversion of organic wastes into a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide commonly termed as biogas. Attention is paid to this conversion system due to the increasing cost of energy production. The major components of biogas include methane and carbon dioxide plus atmospheric nitrogen oxygen and traces of organic compounds are collectively known as landfill gas LFG . LFG is a low-quality gas that requires purification from volatile organic con taminants and CO2. LFG is used for electricity generation use in an in ternal combustion engine turbines and microturbines and direct use in boilers dryers kilns greenhouse and cogeneration Naik et al. 2010 Vargas-Estrada et al. 2022 Zabed et al. 2020 . Brennan and Owende 2010 described the three sequential stages of AD hydrolysis fermentation and methanogenesis. Breaking down of complex com pounds into soluble sugars occurred in the hydrolysis step followed by the conversion of sugars into alcohols acetic acid volatile fatty acids VFA and gas containing H2 and CO2 by fermentative bacteria which is metabolised into methane CH4 60 70 and CO2 30 40 by methanogens. AD process has a greater propensity for nutrient recycling and energy recovery Sialve et al. 2009 . Basically the throughput depends on the substrate employed for digestion optimal operating conditions for biogas production can be defined such as pH 6.8 7.5 temperature 30.0 35.0 C C N ratio 20 30 total solids 7.0 9.0 and time 20 40 days . The AD operating process is affected by organic loadings temperature pH retention time in reactors mesophilic con ditions 35 C and thermophilic conditions 55 C Harun et al. 2010 . But Vergara-Fern andez et al. 2008 showed that biogas with methane concentration 50 65 can be generated from marine algae which can be used as a fuel gas and also can be converted to generate electricity Harun et al. 2010 and can also be used onsite to assist some of the processes that require thermal energy e.g. drying the algae Harun et al. 2010 Zabed et al. 2020 . Various authors in the literature have discusses immensely the potentials of microalgae as the biogas feed stocks screening and selection approaches of potent strains of micro algae technological aspects of microalgal biogas production reactor design for anaerobic digestion AD operational conditions affecting AD strategies for improving strains and biogas yield biogas upgrading kinetics modelling value added product and as well as economics life cycle assessment LCA coupled with the integration of AD process with microalgae biofuel production using AD processes Gonzalez-Fernandez et al. 2015 Vargas-Estrada et al. 2022 Zabed et al. 2020 . The solid residual biomass after digestion can be further utilized for bio-fertilizer production incinerated or used in animal feed Costa and de Morais 2011 . AD process is particularly suitable for high moisture 80 90 organic waste which can be useful for the optimization of wet algal biomass. AD process can be utilized to generate liquid fuel and biofertilizers for agricultural production Brennan and Owende 2010 Costa and de Morais 2011 Naik et al. 2010 . Currently research attention has been diverted to the production of liquid fuels methanol rather than gaseous fuels methane from anaerobic digestion. This is because of the inherent cost connected to methane purification and collection. The advantages of methanol production include a Produc tion of low Sulphur and low ash fuels in commercial quantities and b Liquid fuel is much easier to handle store and transport than gaseous products Naik et al. 2010 . Zamalloa et al. 2011 has estimated the cost range of biomass to be 86-124 ton 1 DM available for bio-methanation under the premise of achievable up-concentrations of 0.2 0.6 kg m-3 to 20 60 kg dry matter DM m 3 plus effective bio-methanation of the concentrate at a loading rate of 20 kg DM m 3 d 1. Algae biomass-total energy module would be in the order of 0.170 0.087 kWh 1 considering carbon credit of about 30 ton 1 CO2 eq Zamalloa et al. 2011 . Photo-biological hydrogen production is a two-stage photosynthetic production of hydrogen in which the second stage is subjected to anaerobic conditions for consistent production of hydrogen. The process efficiency involved either two-stage production or simultaneous pro duction of hydrogen. In the two-stage process photosynthetic oxygen production and H2 generation are spatially separated such that algae are grown initially and photosynthetically in a normal condition followed by Sulphur deprivation under anaerobic conditions to consistently produce hydrogen Brennan and Owende 2010 . In the second type of production electrons that are released upon photosynthetic H20 oxidation are fed directly into the hydrogenase-mediated hydro gen-evolution process. Brennan and Owende 2010 . The hydrogen productivity in the two-stage process is more optimistic than the Simultaneous approach due to severe hydrogenase inhibition due to the photosynthetic oxygen produced in the process Brennan and Owende 2010 . Saifuddin and Priatharsini 2016 have reviewed the production of hydrogen from microalgae biomass describing the four effective methods that are involved direct bio-photolysis photo-fermentation dark fermentation and indirect bio-photolysis. Even though sulphur deprivations techniques are involved to enhance the hydrogen yield but challenges due to low biomass concentrations and significant processing costs present a stumbling block for the industrial viability of the process and thus require further research for its realization. It is paramount to appreciate that bio-hydrogen production from microalgae is more energy-efficient than conventional methods and advocates for M. Bello et al. Journal of Environmental Management 370 2024 122208 18 integrating hydrogen production with high-value products for sustain ability. There is a greater need for understanding the biological pro cesses and enzymes involved to advance sustainable hydrogen technologies from microalgae biomass. 4. Conclusion Presently there are many evolving and potential microalgae tech nologies that are under investigation but the challenge that remains for various algal-to-biofuel technologies is demonstrating their efficacy in large-scale production for commercial application. More often than not the most viable technologies for microalgal biofuels and bio-chemical productions are evaluated in terms of their throughput cost energy requirement scalability resources requirement and environmental performance. Various technical challenges such as microalgal biomass cultivation systems harvesting and drying processes and algal biofuel conversion methods are still not matured but are in the early stage of research and development R D . Intensive ventures in R D are vigorously needed to ensure the technical viability and commercial feasibility of the algae-to-bioenergy system. From the techno-economic standpoint recent trends have indicated that the algal-to-biofuel process is still considerably expensive in comparison to what is being envisaged in terms of other renewables and compared to fossil fuels thus strong political support is needed to catalyse the commercial viability of the algal biofuel process so as to be able to compete constructively in the global biofuel market. More often than not multidisciplinary research and development approaches in algae-to-energy systems could help in achieving the desired progress including genetic modification for high oil content and selection of algae strains mixed algae cultivations in tegrated with wastewater for high biomass yield and low cultivation cost the multi-product integrated biorefinery approach intertwined with new technologies for maximum oil recovery such as hydrothermal liquefaction process. This is a clear indication that optimism for using algal biomass to produce alternative fuels has been pampered and thus advanced improvements are needed to address the industrial sustain ability of utilizing this renewable feedstock for commercial application.

Algal biofuels have received significant attention among researchers and energy experts owing to an upsurge in global energy issues emanating from depletion in fossil fuel reserves increasing greenhouse gases emission conflict among agricultural crops traditional biomass feedstock and potential fu turistic energy security. Further the exploration of value-added microalgae as sustainable and viable feedstock for the production of variety of biofuels such as biogas bio-hydrogen bioethanol and biodiesel are addressed. Moreover the assessment of life-cycle energy balance and environmental impacts of biofuel production from microalgae are briefly discussed. The present study focused on recent advancements in synthetic biology metabolic engineering tools algal bio refinery and the optimization of algae growth conditions. This paper also elucidates the function of microalgae as bio refineries the conditions of algae-based cultures and other oper ational factors that must be adjusted to produce biofuels that are price-competitive with fossil fuels. 1. Introduction Consumption of fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases GHGs which impact the global climate risking both human life and ecological sys tems Duan 2023 Lelieveld et al. 2019 . Currently fossil fuels account for 90 of the energy requirement worldwide which has led to several serious issues such as energy crises and environmental challenges Martins et al. 2019 . These concerns need to be addressed by finding more sustainable renewable and efficient energy sources. The origi nation of biofuels from biomass which is considered one of the most practical energy alternative sources to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Biofuels are considered superior to fossil fuels in several ways including sustainability non-toxicity biodegradability and incredibly low carbon dioxide CO2 emissions Malla et al. 2022 . The preparation of biofuel from biomass has several advantages i.e. they produce renewable en ergy reduce environmental pollution and climate change. The primary cause of global warming is the release of greenhouse gases as a result of combustion of fossil fuels. Wang and Azam 2024 Soeder 2021 Petroleum-based fuels have negligible oxygen levels with substantial sulfur emissions whereas biofuels particularly algal fuels have oxygen levels of 10 45 and extremely low sulfur emissions. To optimize en ergy generation and low cost the development of feedstock is an essential cost-limiting step in the production of biofuels. The choice of biomass for biofuel synthesis has a direct impact on economic envi ronmental sustainability and greenhouse gas emission Cerri et al. 2017 . Biodiesel and bioethanol are commonly used in crop-based biofuels rapeseed palm sugarcane corn and so on are made from lipid-based substrates Wang et al. 2022 . These biofuels also known as first-generation biofuels recent issues about the use of first-generation biofuels are mostly due to the issues related to ecosystem imbalance and the requirement for greater area of cultivable land to produce a sufficient amount of crop-based biofuels Barr et al. 2021 . On contrary to that a cultivable crop causes less issues due to attaining efficient area Corresponding author. E-mail addresses M. Abdullah Z. Ali M.T.

Furthermore several non-edible feed-stocks including agricultural residues and waste or spent cooking oils have been effectively transformed into bioethanol and biodiesel respectively. These are referred as second-generation biofuels. Non-edible feed-stocks continue to possess a limited capacity to satisfy the world s total energy needs Jamil 2023 . Green algae can survive in a variety of aquatic environments such as rivers lakes sea and even in wastewater. They grow independently or in association with other species Salvatore et al. 2023 and they have the ability to endure a wide range of unfavorable circumstances including reservoirs and deserts as well as variations in different external stimuli Barsanti et al. et al. 2008 . Algae are classified into three general groups Phaeophyta brown algae Chlorophyta green algae and Rhodophyta red algae . They are further divided into two distinct categories macroalgae and microalgae. Seaweed also known as macroalgae which is large multicellular algae that can be seen with unaided eye Abdelfattah et al. 2023 single-celled algae that can be either eukaryotic like green algae Chlorophyta or prokaryotic such as cyanobacteria Chloroxybacteria . According to reports 1 kg of algal biomass exchange 1.83 kg of CO2 moreover certain species employ nitrogen-oxides NOx and sulfur-oxides SOx as feedstock in addition to CO2 Gendy and El-Temtamy 2013 . Half of the dry mass of algal biomass is made up of CO2. The benefits of microalgal as a source of biofuels involve their higher photosynthetic efficiency their growth on non-cultivable land their utilization of salty and wastewater sources. Additionally short life cycles enable almost constant harvesting Larkum et al. 2012 . Microalgae that are capable of flourishing on waste materials and possessing an abundance of lipids could offer a practical choice for sourcing biomass as they will not interfere with the availability of food resources during the production of biofuels Ali et al. 2023 . Microalgae have gained a lot of interest among other biomass types for usage as a possible feedstock because of their high lipid and carbohydrate content quick growth rate and resilience to changing environmental circumstances Bhattacharya et al. 2022 . Moreover the development of molecular biology techniques such as zinc-finger nucleases ZFN transcription activator-like effectors TALEs clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR and genetic transformation are being used for the design and synthesis of new biological systems to make advances in the production of biofuel. These advancements have also made it possible to decipher novel metabolic pathways within algal cells Larkum et al. 2012 Bhattacharya et al. 2022 . Microalgae have other extensive feasible applications also such as biological remediation and the production of See Fig. 1 valuable products De Souza et al. 2019 . The world need for energy keeps increasing due to the rapidly growing population Dey et al. 2021 . Fossil fuels such as coal diesel and petrol account for a large portion of the energy consumed worldwide. Nevertheless the primary causes of the deterioration of air quality are environmental pollution climate change global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer driven by the burning of fossil fuels. By 2030 global energy consumption is expected to spike by 50 as projected by the Interna tional Energy Agency IEA Dey et al. 2021 . To solve critical issues like global warming and environmental pollution the suggested solution is the production of algal biofuel. The main concepts of biofuel genera tions challenges and future perspectives associated with micro-algal based biofuels are emphasized. This study will be helpful for future development advancement of efficient and economically feasible technology for microalgae-based production of biofuel. 2. Biofuel generations 2.1. First generation biofuels Biofuels can be classified into first- and second-generation technol ogies. First-generation biofuels involve liquid and gaseous fuels comprising biodiesel bio-ethers bio-alcohol and vegetable oil. The first-generation G1 feedstock comprises oil-bearing seeds and food edible crops such as starch sugarcane rapeseed sunflower palm and animal fats Ganesan et al. 2020 . Triglycerides which are connected to an ester molecule are able to be transformed into biofuels by several methods such as transesterification anaerobic digestion fermentation and pyrolysis. The first-generation biofuels can be utilized either in their pure form or enhanced by blending Nanda et al. 2018 . Edible crop oils such as mustard lemon seed wheat germ rice bran coconut soybean rapeseed sunflower almond and pistachio are used in the manufacturing of biofuels Dey et al. 2021 Hazrat et al. 2019 . Bio diesel plants are employed in Europe North America South America and Asia while maize and sugarcane are considered highly profitable industries in nations such as India the United States France Germany Australia and China. Although first-generation fuels contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas GHG emission and air pollution they can have nega tive effects on food security and lead to societal disputes. The future viability of first-generation fuels is a matter of concern particularly when taking into account stakeholder perspectives in the assessment and ranking of certain generating technologies Ganesan et al. 2020 . The growing significance of utilizing crops for biofuel has led to the ongoing food versus fuel controversy as these crops have become more in demand for food production. Moreover the surge in the need for crops such as maize for the purpose of fuel generation resulted in a rise in the market price of these food items Nazari et al. 2021 as shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 1. Potential applications of microalgae in various fields. M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 2 2.2. Second generation biofuels Second-generation biofuels are produced by combining lignocellu losic biomass from agriculture and agro-industrial leftovers with other waste streams from the food sector such as wheat bran fats from ani mals and waste cooking oil. Non-food plants growing in wastelands such as the drought-tolerant shrub and Jatropha curcas potentially be a viable source Kumar and Sharma 2008 . These biofuels avoid changes in agricultural land usage and cannot compete with food supplies. Second-generation waste streams on the other hand often comprise complex feedstocks that can include chemicals that limit fermentation efficiency demand extra pretreatment processes and increase process time and costs Malode et al. 2021 . The commercial production of first and second-generation biofuels was observed in 2019 with respective outputs of 4 and 96 Abdullah et al. 2019 . As an example Clariant s Sunliquid is a cellulosic ethanol made from straw and other underused agricultural byproducts. The first commercial ethanol plant industry in Romania began operations in 2022 producing 50 000 tons of ethanol a year from 250 000 tons of domestically obtained agricultural leftovers Cavelius et al. 2023 . Microbial lipids produced by organisms like the yeast Cutaneo trichosporon oleaginosus can also be used to make second-generation biodiesel. This is because these organisms can make up to 90 lipids per biomass via fermentation Malode et al. 2021 Abdullah et al. 2019 . Second-generation biodiesel can also be produced from oil res idue using catalytic cracking and hydrogenation however there are downsides such as partial conversion and coke production Cavelius et al. 2023 Fuchs et al. 2021 . Biobutanol is usually made from lignocellulose material and other waste streams using Clostridia fermentation which is one of the oldest and most well-known ways to make butanol through fermentation. Several Clostridia are natural butanol makers with the capacity to metabolize a wide range of substrates. However the method is inef fective and has weak butanol titers and product inhibition Younes et al. 2020 Zhang et al. 2022a . Although cell-free isobutanol production via a planned artificial metabolic route has been created commercialization remains prohibitively expensive. At the moment commercialization of this technology is not economic Guterl et al. 2012 . 2.3. Third generation biofuels Primary source of third-generation biofuels is biomass derived from cyanobacteria and microalgae which are naturally capable of producing lipids and alcohols that can be converted into biodiesel or other fuel products. Algae produce biomass more rapidly than terrestrial plants because their photosynthesis rates are 2 4 times greater than other plants Li et al. 2008 Rabbani et al. 2024 . Some of the unique characteristics of algae include a their ability to absorb carbon dioxide during growth which helps to reduce the greenhouse impact b their small growth requirements in comparison to other food crops c their ability to adapt to saltwater and d a high lipid content Mathimani and Pugazhendhi 2019 Pandey et al. 2011 Policastro et al. 2024 . In freshwater and aquatic environments microalgae are the foundation of life. There are sixteen groups and 72 500 species. The three primary groups are diatoms Chlorophyceae and Chrysophyceae. The most researched groups for biological implications include diatoms cyano bacteria and cyanophyceae Patel et al. 2022 . These algae can with stand extreme climatic conditions and develop swiftly forming a baggy layer on the water s surface. Research and cultivation of algae for the production of high-value goods are being conducted in several nations Jacob-Lopes et al. 2019 . A few examples of algae that have received research attention are Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 21 lipids 48 Fig. 2. The evolution of biofuel from 1st generation crops to 4th generation genetic engineering . M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 3 sugars Spirulina platensis 8 lipids 60 sugars Chlorella sp. 19 lipids 56 sugars Ranjbar and Malcata 2022 Mathimani and Pugazhendhi 2019 and the composition for other algal strains is listed below in Table 1. Algae for their production do not need either culti vable land or clean water. Waste water brackish water or salt water can also be used to cultivate a plethora of different kinds of cultures which is both economical and avoids conflict with farming Melcher et al. 2021 . The most critical component for effective algal growth is a direct supply of carbon dioxide which can be obtained from either industrial sources or atmospheric carbon capture. In conventional cultivating systems approximately 70 of the provided carbon dioxide is utilized for photosynthesis and thus biomass generation Cavelius et al. 2023 . Algae culture is an extremely important and flexible step in the development of algal biofuels from a financial perspective. Since algal bioreactors do not rely on environmental conditions or geographic location they can potentially run almost anywhere. Biofuels and other low-priced high-volume goods are often made from algae cultivated in open ponds. Open-pond systems are less expensive but they have problems such as excessive loss of water and a lack of temperature control which reduces biomass output. For high-priced low-volume items such as cosmetic components the utilization of closed photo bioreactors is encouraged. These bioreactors provide more accurate regulation of process parameters which in turn increases output Pandey et al. 2011 Raut et al. 2015 . In contrast to higher plants which tend to have their lipids concentrated in certain areas like rape seeds algae have the potential to store a large quantity of lipids in every cell making their oil manufacturing process more effective overall Lee et al. 2015 . However the culture conditions have an impact on the lipid content of microalgae. By maximizing the growth-determining parameters the lipid content can potentially be raised beyond the average by over 80 Rodionova et al. 2017 . The cell walls of microalgae usually contain cellulose protein lignin pectin hemi celluloses and other carbs. These can be broken down into monomers using acids or enzymes to make bioethanol Neto et al. 2019 . However since microalgal cells are sensitive to pH fluctuations and have a small size and density harvesting creates a challenge Lee et al. 2015 . In the European Union in 2021 Araujo Araújo et al. 2021 identified 447 production units for algae and the cyanobacteria Spirulina . Commer cial usage of biofuels accounted for a negligible fraction of the biomass directed by these enterprises the majority of which went toward food feed and associated products. The commercialization process requires more technical advancements in upscaling and lowering manufacturing expenses Cavelius et al. 2023 . 3. Microalgae cultivation and harvesting for biofuels via sustainable approach Microalgae are capable of storing an abundance of energy-dense substances like triacylglycerol starch and proteins See Fig. 3 when they are allowed to thrive in optimal conditions Schüler et al. 2017 . These molecules are packed with energy and are capable of being changed into biodiesel bioethanol and biogas Khoo et al. 2023 . These Biofuels are commonly referred to as third-generation biofuels indi cating that they represent a whole new category in the area of renewable bioenergy Rafa et al. 2021 .

Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 4 growing conditions and growth modes is discussed below in Table 2. 3.1. Algae cultivation Algae are a great option for use as a primary source for biofuel production due to their fast growth rate. Algae can be cultivated in either open or closed systems. Open systems such as ponds and lakes are generally suitable for enhancing production simply because they are technically less complicated compared to closed systems Borowitzka and Vonshak 2017 . The optimal layout of the cultivation system would allow the maximum amount of sunlight to reach every single algal cell. Open ponds have a significant production potential but their yield is lower compared to closed systems due to a number of factors including water temperature moisture losses the diffusion of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and the risks of contamination. Photobioreactors which are closed systems provide a controlled and regulated cultivation environment with a lower chance of contamination. Additionally more light penetrates the algae on a broad surface area. On the contrary better agitation opportunities in a closed photobioreactor lead to an enhancement in the fixation of CO2 functionality over an open system. Closed systems also provide greater heat retention than open systems but there are some downsides to scaling them up. Thus it tends to be more expensive than open growing systems and size limitations Andersson et al. 2014 . Photosynthesis-driven biomass accumulation develops in nitrogen- rich environments whereas lipid development in microalgae takes place under stressful situations like inadequate nutrient availability Udayan et al. 2023 . This contradiction significantly disrupts the ongoing production of lipids hence impacting the economic stability of the system. The fed-batch procedure is significantly considered as an optimal approach for cultivating microalgae owing to its ability to Fig. 3. Nutrients of different microalgae species.

Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 5 customize the nutrients supplied during the process. In research done by Zheng Zheng et al. 2013 it was shown that the lipid concentration and algal biomass had a significant rise with the application of fed-batch bioreactor. Furthermore research has demonstrated that the provision of light in both phototrophic and mixotrophic processes during the fed-batch culture leads to enhanced production of lipids Cheirsilp and Torpee 2012 . 3.1.1. Open-pond systems Open-pond cultivation is considered a financially viable approach for the large-scale cultivation of microalgae due to its straightforward na ture minimal energy requirements and capacity for expansion Costa and De Morais 2014 . It can be used in aquatic bodies such as lakes and ponds non-natural water bodies such as circular and raceway ponds and containers such as tanks. However due to the low cell concentration of microalgae in freshwater an effective collecting technique is required Tan et al. 2020 . Microalgal productivity in open water bodies can be substantially impacted by various challenges including rainfall discharge bank erosion and contamination by protozoa and bacteria Siddiki et al. 2022 . To overcome these concerns microalgae can be cultivated in severe alkaline or saline environments where just a few pollutants can persist. Furthermore since the system is open it is not possible to manage some growth factors such as temperature and light intensity which can influence the growth rate of microalgae. Despite these obstacles open-pond cultivation is still a common method for growing microalgae Tan et al. 2020 . The potential solutions or im provements have been made to mitigate these issues in open-pond sys tems such as mixotrophic cultivation technique utilizing multiple algal strains and internet of things. The Mixotrophic Cultivation technique integrates both photosyn thetic and heterotrophic growth modes which improves productivity and nutrient consumption making the method more effectual. Utilizing multiple algal strains can enhance the resilience of systems against environmental changes and contamination resulting in more stable and productive systems Qin et al. 2019 . Automated monitoring and control systems that are implemented in algal growth can maintain optimal conditions for growth such as pH temperature and nutrient levels. Lastly the Internet of Things IoT can provide real-time data and remote management capabilities which can improve the overall effi ciency and scalability of open-pond systems Fabris et al. 2020 . The earliest artificial ponds utilized for large-scale microalgal farming were circular ponds. These circular-shaped tanks are 30 70 cm deep and 45 m wide with a spinning agitator in the center. The agitator enables proper mixing and prevents algal biomass from sedimenting. The size of the pond however limits the design because larger ponds have more water resistance which can put strain on the stirrer s me chanical components Tan et al. 2020 . Furthermore the design con sumes a lot of energy during the agitation process and has significant construction costs Hamed 2016 . A practical example has been observed in Japan and Taiwan for the cultivation of Chlorella Tan et al. 2020 . 3.1.2. Photo-bioreactors closed-system A photo-bioreactor is a bioreactor system that is used to cultivate phototrophs such as microalgae in a tightly enclosed environment thereby overcoming the usual limitations of pond cultivation systems. Its tiny size and carefully regulated growing conditions enable more effective utilization of space as well as improved nutritional and meta bolic efficiency resulting in increased biomass output per unit of sub strate Tan et al. 2020 . However due to design problems photobioreactors have limited scalability making them costly for large-scale manufacturing Gupta et al. 2015 . Tubular photobioreactors are made up of prolonged transparent tubes made of glass or polymers that are stacked in different orientations to maximize sunlight collection. A filter system with cooling attachment is present followed by a mechanical pump which is used to spread microalgae culture inside the loop Fig. 4 . The primary disadvantage of tubular photobioreactors is poor mass transport throughout the system which lead to variations in substrate and product concentrations. In Germany and Israel large-scale tubular photobioreactors are utilized to cultivate Haematococcus and Chlorella Tan et al. 2020 . Similarly vertical column bioreactors are used to cultivate Chlorella zofingiensis in Guangdong China Huo et al. 2018 whereas Algamo a firm in Krkonoe Czech Republic uses flat-plate photobioreactors to manufac ture astaxanthin Koushalya et al. 2022 . Open-pond setups for microalgal culture are cheap and simple to operate making them suited for large-scale operations owing to their simple design and dependence on natural sunlight which results in cheaper startup and ongoing expenditures Baldev et al. 2022 . They use less energy for stirring and maintaining temperatures which further reduces operational costs Narala et al. 2016 . However they confront obstacles such as increased contamination threats from external sources and a reliance on meteorological conditions which can reduce pro ductivity Xiaogang et al. 2022 . On the other hand closed systems or photobioreactors provide a regulated environment that reduces contamination concerns and allows for constant output resulting in increased biomass productivity. These systems have a higher initial cost and running expenses due to the need for artificial lighting temperature control and more complicated infrastructure. Furthermore closed sys tems use more energy to sustain ideal growth conditions and need more technical knowledge to operate and retain Koushalya et al. 2022 . Ultimately the decision between open-pond and closed systems is based on unique operational requirements available assets and the ideal equilibrium of cost level of complexity and efficiency. 3.2. Algae harvesting Algae harvesting is the process of separating or detaching algae from medium in which they grow. The characteristics of the chosen micro algae such as their size and density as well as the particular needs of the end products and the potential for reusing the growing medium all have a major impact on the harvesting technique Fabris et al. 2020 Hamed 2016 Gupta et al. 2015 . Algal harvesting techniques that are now accessible often rely on chemical biological mechanical and electrical principles. However to get a greater level of microalgal separation at a lower price it is feasible to use two harvesting methods combined. Employing the sequential downstream processes of flocculation sedi mentation and centrifugation can significantly reduce processing costs Fabris et al. 2020 Hamed 2016 . The primary methods executed for microalgal harvesting are centrifugation filtering flocculation sedimentation flotation and electrophoresis Ananthi et al. 2021 . 3.2.1. Flocculation Flocculation refers to the act of separating solute granules from a liquid by forming clumps called flocs Mubarak et al. 2019 . Microalgal harvesting techniques using flocculation include four mechanisms that can occur either in pairs or individually i The charge neutralization process involves the adsorption of charged microalgal cell surfaces by oppositely charged ions polymers or colloids. ii The electrostatic patch mechanism functions when polymers with opposite charges hold the charge on the surface of an algae cell. This creates patches that connect microalgal cells with opposite charges and cause them to stick together. iii The bridging process occurs when charged colloids or polymers adhere to the membrane of two distinct microalgal cells creating a bridge. iv Sweeping flocculation in which the particles that precipitate in the culture medium capture microalgal cells Vandamme 2013 . Due to the negative charge of algae cells they can be counter acted by introducing flocculants such as cationic polymers and multi valent cations observed in the liquid Matter et al. 2019 . M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 6 3.2.2. Flotation The process of flotation is employed to harvest microalgal cells on a commercial scale and works on the concept of the separation of bubbles connected to destabilized particles rising to the top and concentrating when mixed with flocculants Esteves et al. 2020 . Biological compo nent recovery was accomplished in a single step by utilizing surface-active components to absorb them into the air bubble surface at a higher concentration coefficient Phong et al. 2017 . The microalgae cell surface is also hydrophobic which makes it easy to separate the biomass from the culture by adding a surfactant. Floating efficiency is affected by several factors such as the following the size of particles floating rate pH medium ionic strength air tank pressure hydraulic retention time water recycling rate surfactant type and concentration Pooja et al. 2022 . The low-density microalgal cells have self-floating properties making this type of separation quicker and more effective than sedimentation Xu et al. 2021 . 3.2.2.1. Dissolved air flotation DAF . Algal cells are removed from the top of the solution using air-dissolved flotation an energy-intensive technique. This method increases the effectiveness of flotation by add ing supersaturated water at low pressure. In order to separate flocs bigger bubbles are required Park et al. 2011 . When it comes to algae the efficiency of the separation using Poly-DADMAC is 95 but with cationic CTAB and metal coagulant aluminum sulfate it s 60 63 Ananthi et al. 2021 . 3.2.2.2. Dispersed air flotation. The flotation cells are powered by airflow that passes through porous materials such as spargers or dis persers using a technique called foam or froth flotation. This method demands costly equipment for producing air bubbles and uses a low amount of energy while operating at high pressure Nguyen et al. 2013 . According to Kurniawati Kurniawati et al. 2014 and Park Park et al. 2011 when certain synthetic and natural collectors like sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS chitosan saponin and N-cetyl-N-N-N trimethy lammonium bromide CTAB are added to the flotation process it be comes even more effective. Researcher Phoochinda Phoochinda and White 2003 discovered that Scenedesmusquadricauda floated 90 of the time with the use of CTAB which increased the rate of aeration and decreased the size of air bubbles. In 2014 Kurniawati Kurniawati et al. 2014 discovered that using 20 mg L of saponin and 5 mg L of chitosan as flocculants helped separate more than 93 of microalgae cells using the flotation method. In a study conducted by Garg Garg et al. 2015 it was shown that the use of a sophisticated flotation apparatus in conjunction with collector dodecyl pyridinium chloride DPC resulted in a 23-fold increase in algal concentration and a 99 rate of recovery of marine microalgal cells. 3.2.2.3. Filtration. Filtration harvesting is a technique that relies only on gravity forces and operates in a vacuum or under pressure Fasaei et al. 2018 . There are two possible states for this process continuous and discontinuous. Aside from hoovers and pressure filters several in dustrial filters use gravitational forces to screen bigger particles through a mesh or a layer of coarse particles similar to sand. Filter aids can be applied before filtering pre-coat to keep thepermeability which helps prevent the creation of thick and impermeable cake that plugs the filter media. Several applications have been designed to satisfy the demands of industrial equipment taking into account the scale of the equipment. Filtration under low pressure or gravity forces is also employed to Fig. 4. Algal biomass production in a Tubular Photobioreactor closed-system . M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 7 harvest all microalgal cell cultures including filamentous algal species such as Arthrospira spirulina. The membrane filtering method produces the most suitable biomass with no chemical intervention and it has the fewest disruptions to the cells compared to the other harvesting methods Fabris et al. 2020 Vandamme 2013 . 3.2.3. Centrifugation In centrifugation a centrifugal force is used to speed up the move ment and separation of particles. Separation is based on the change in density between the particles and the medium around them. Centrifugal force is often used to enhance productivity decrease gravity sedimen tation and accelerate the settling process. Disc stack centrifuges which have a gravitational force ranging from 4000 to 14 000 times are the most popular industrial centrifuges. Although they use a lot of power these centrifuge machines can concentrate 0.02 0.05 of microalgal cells that are 3 30 mm in size Ananthi et al. 2021 . According to Koyande Koyande et al. 2022 the anticipated harvesting cost for algal cellharvesting is approximately 20 30 .According to Milledge Milledge and Heaven 2011 centrifugation in biodiesel production consumes a lot of energy with little yield. The disc-stack solid bowl hydrocyclone tubular and multi-chamber centrifuges are the most common types of centrifuges that are currently effective for harvesting algal biomass Najjar and Abu-Shamleh 2020 . 4. Pretreatment of algal biomass The pretreatment of the algae biomass involves breaking down or disrupting the biomass in order to transform accumulate and utilize the carbohydrates and lipids that are present in it. Large-scale pretreatment of biomass is an expensive and constricting stage in the production of biofuels Khan et al. 2018 . According to recent research the produc tion of bioethanol and biofuels requires a variety of novel cell disruption approaches and procedures Yoo et al. 2012 . Researchers worldwide are currently developing pre-treatment pro cedures for microalgae in order to produce more effective lipid products. The cell-disrupting method involves the breakdown of cells to extract the intercellular products. Research has shown that pre-treatment techniques utilize an immense quantity of energy while breaking down cells Krishnamoorthy et al. 2022 . Certain microalgal species possess inherent qualities that make them suitable for effective lipid extraction however this characteristic is not universal across all forms of algae. To achieve substantial cell disruption it is crucial to choose the appropriate pre-treatment strategy that maximizes the efficiency of disruption Yoo et al. 2012 . Before fermenting the algal biomass undergoes pretreatment which involves the disruption of the algal cells in order to release the carbo hydrates held within the cells Bhushan et al. 2023 . The next phase involves the conversion of the accumulating sugars into monomers by saccharification. This process is essential because fermenting microbes can only metabolize sugars in their fermentable forms which often include disaccharides and monosaccharides particularly hexoses and pentoses while the end product of this process of transformation is ethanol Althuri et al. 2018 . The ever-increasing demand for biodiesel has created a need for new pretreatment processes and technologies Yoo et al. 2012 . The range of pretreatment methods utilized for cell disruption is primarily categorized into mechanical thermal physical biological and chemical methods shown in Fig. 5. 4.1. Mechanical pretreatment methods Mechanical pre-treatment methods such as high-pressure homoge nization high-speed homogenization and bead milling are used in order to disrupt cell walls using shear forces Patel et al. 2018 . They are efficient in removing lipids for the synthesis of biofuel by decreasing the size and crystallinity of cell wall particles as the cells break down Tedesco et al. 2014 . By using these techniques the risk of cell contamination and damage during cell rupture is effectively avoided. They enhance the cell s surface area and disruption efficacy hence increasing their effectiveness in the production of biofuel at the indus trial level Krishnamoorthy et al. 2022 . High-pressure homogenizers HPHs are used for the disruption of algal cells because they can operate continuously and can be scaled up to produce a large amount of wet biomass Ekpeni et al. 2015 . Studies have shown that the HPH approach is more effective in extracting lipids from microalgae by breaking up the cells. Various valve seat configu rations are accessible to enhance the efficacy of cell disruption. High-pressure homogenizers HPHs can make microalgae concentrates that are damp and have 25 W W solids. This makes it possible to extract lipids effectively without much energy consumption Lee et al. 2012 . Pre-treatment techniques using high-pressure homogenizers HPHs are used in several sectors to disrupt seaweed and yeast cells hence enhancing the production of lipids Lee et al. 2010 . Bead mills are commonly employed for the extraction of lipids in microalgae cell disruption providing exceptional disruption efficiency in a single operation Lee et al. 2017 . There are two sorts of vessels Fig. 5. Methods of pretreatment for biofuel production from algae biomass. M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 8 agitated vessels and shaking vessels. By causing the whole vessel to vibrate shaking vessels be utilized to disturb cells while in agitated vessels a rotating agitator is employed packed with cell culture and bead pellets. Several factors including microalgal cell biomass bead size and cell stiffness determine the rate of cell disruption Halim et al. 2013 . Upon the imposition of shear force the cells in the regions of bead collisions are disturbed leading to the transfer of energy from the beads to the cells Han et al. 2023 . It is recommended to use beads larger than 0.5 mm in order to get more efficient outcomes. However their substantial energy requirements and running expenses render them less favorable for industrial applications Doucha and Lívanský 2008 . 4.2. Physical pretreatment methods The physical cell breakdown approach employs either microwave or ultrasonic pre-treatment methods devoid of any chemical involvement. Microwave pretreatment techniques employ electromagnetic waves of optimal frequency ranging from 0.3 to 300 GHz in order to generate heat in specific regions thereby enhancing the kinetic energy of water mol ecules until they attain the state of boiling Rodriguez et al. 2015 . The temperature rises as a result of the thermal radiation caused by the alignment of polarized macromolecules around the pole of the electro magnetic field leading to the disintegration of hydrogen ions Patil et al. 2013 . Microwaves can generate sufficient pressure and heat en ergy to cause damage to the cell walls and membranes of algae Carpentieri et al. 2021 . Cell disruption is the result of microwaves interacting with water-based molecules leading to the formation of free radicals. Microwaves exhibit better temperature uniformity during heat transfer compared to conventional heating which makes them prefer able to bead milling and ultrasonic techniques Talati and Haghighi 2022 . Although both techniques have benefits these processes lack extraction yield and lengthy solvent usage times Krishnamoorthy et al. 2022 . The ultrasonic technique employs in liquids and encourages the cell to disintegrate. This method includes emitting ultrasound into a liquid medium which causes microbubbles to develop when liquid molecules move because of acoustic vibrations Shi et al. 2021 . Cavi tation during ultrasonication enhances micro-turbulence effects visco sity pressure and shockwaves which accelerate the breakdown of microalgae cells for optimal lipid extraction. It has been used to improve biodiesel production by rupturing microalgae cells and other forms of biomass material such as animal fat waste non-edible vegetable oils and sludge. Ultrasonic pre-treatment improves the general efficiency of breaking down algal cells because it creates emulsions and cavitations between systems where the liquids don t mix Onumaegbu et al. 2018 . It is primarily used to shorten the time required for microalgal cell disruption during pre-treatment for the production of lipids. In the absence of alternative pre-treatment approaches ultrasonic pre-treatment boosts biodiesel output using canola and palm oil and can be utilized swiftly and constantly to disrupt bacillus spores and vege table oils Van Manh et al. 2011 . Microwave pre-treatment is partic ularly efficient owing to its quick heating capabilities along with its capacity to boost biogas generation but scaling it up for industrial purposes can be expensive Chen et al. 2024 Li et al. 2024 . How ever ultrasonic pre-treatment is more cost-effective and successful at scaling up because it employs sound waves to create bubbles in the sludge. These bubbles are then popped break down particles and pro mote solubilization Golbabaei Kootenaei et al. 2022 Wang et al. 2024 . While both techniques work well ultrasonic pre-treatment is particularly advantageous due to its scalability and affordability for massive operations. 4.3. Thermal pretreatment methods Some thermal pre-treatment techniques like steam explosion or autoclaving add temperature to the surfaces of algae biomass to break up cell bonds make solubilization better and extract plenty of biomass with minimal energy consumption Cabeza et al. 2023 . The autoclaving technique for microalgae biomass is a heat treat ment process requiring 121 C of temperature at a pressure of 15 psi Pˆojo et al. 2021 . This mechanism ruptures microalgae cells increasing the release of lipids. According to research autoclave pre-treatment of Nannochloropsis oculata biomass enhances lipid production over non-pre-treatment biomass Surendhiran and Vijay 2014 . Lee et al. 2010 also verified amazing oil recovery from Chlorella vulgaris by adopting an autoclave method. Surendhiran and Vijays work on Nan nochloropsisoculata revealed a high lipid output of 29.34 after 30 min of autoclave pre-treatment Surendhiran and Vijay 2014 . Heat explosions process involves exposing the material to elevated temperatures ranging from 160 to 260 C while simultaneously keeping the pressure at a consistent range of 1.03 3.45 MPa Cheng and Timil sina 2011 . Cell disruption takes place when there is a decrease in pressure under typical conditions during pre-treatment. It is important to carry out this process at moderate temperatures to avoid lipid degradation Nurra et al. 2014 . Nurra et al. 2014 showed this idea by employing heat explosion pre-treatment on the biomass of Nanno chloropsis gaditana sp. Medina et al. 1998 confirmed that the extraction of carotenoids results in a yield of 15 increase as a result of elevated pressure during heat explosion pre-treatment. 4.4. Chemical pretreatment Chemical pretreatment methods include the use of chemicals such as alkaline and organic solvents hypochlorites detergents chaotropes antibiotics and chelating agents to improve the process of cell disrup tion. Alkaline pre-treatment techniques such as the use of potassium sodium hydroxide and calcium are utilized on algal biomass within a pH range of 9 12. Acid pre-treatments consist of treating substances with H2SO4 and HCl at reduced pH values. Antibodies remove lipids from cell membrane constituents by internally blocking them whereas chelating chemicals link cell membrane molecules together to induce rupture. Detergents interact with membrane molecules causing them to dissolve and penetrate the cell membrane and cell wall Park et al. 2011 Patil et al. 2013 . Oxidizing chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and ozone have the ability to disturb the structure of cell walls Kendir and Ugurlu 2018 . However the energy required to increase the amount of biomass using these agents is relatively low compared to other approaches. Chemical pre-treatment techniques are less prevalent in microalgal biomass production compared to physical or thermal procedures. These substances have corrosive properties are toxic and can release inhibi tory components that can result in contamination Gonzalez-Fernandez et al. 2018 . Research has shown that Scenedesmus and Chlorella biomass exhibited pH enhancements ranging from 9 to 11. However elevating the pH to 13 resulted in negative impacts on microalgal cells due to excessive alkalinity Bohutskyi et al. 2014 . Ozonation pre-treatments significantly enhanced energy efficiency increasing it from 6 to 66 across several phases Carde na et al. 2017 . 4.5. Biological pretreatment Biological enzymes have distinct properties such as biological spe cialty moderate working conditions minimal energy consumption and a high degradation rate Xiao et al. 2019 . These enzymes have signif icant potential for cell disruption. Glycoside hydrolases Saumonneau et al. 2023 peptidase Phong et al. 2018 lipase Balduyck et al. 2019 and glucanase Zhang et al. 2022b enzymes have been utilized to break down and degrade different types of microalgae. In lysis the enzyme selectively binds to certain molecules on the cell membrane or wall in order to dismantle them. Nevertheless the length of the process is extensive and the efficacy of disruption is comparatively limited compared to mechanical or chemical disruption approaches Li et al. M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 9 2022 . Moreover the primary constraint for biological enzymes is their high price and the limited variety of enzymes accessible for the disruption of microalgae cells Zhang et al. 2022c . 5. Enhancing lipid synthesis and yield through genetic manipulation of green microalgae 5.1. Recapitulation of genetic engineering applied to microalgae In the past decade a lot of research has been conducted with microalgal species from the genera Chlorella Phaeodactylum Dunaliella and Nannochloropsis for a broad range of applications. Neutral lipids are elevated in these organisms when they are starved of nutrients Fu et al. 2019 . By transesterification these neutral lipids like TAGs are sub sequently transformed into biofuels. Simultaneously microalgal-based lipids are becoming more and more popular particularly in the food sector since they could substitute fish oil and serve as a unique supply of polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs such as omega-3 and omega-6 which are beneficial to human health and nourishment Ghiffary et al. 2019 . Although the potential advantages of microalgae the ex penses associated with upstream as well as downstream processing make it challenging to turn out these commodities or chemicals on a signifi cant scale. In order to develop a method or system that is commercially practical research in fields like DNA engineering and biological engi neering synthetic biology must continue to improve. Consideration is being given to use strain modification through indirect or direct genetic engineering to enhance microalgal genera for biofuel lipid production Radakovits et al. 2010 . It therefore makes sense to enhance the quality of the lipids being produced in addition to using metabolic engineering to improve the total quantity of microalgal lipids. Some efforts have been made to improve the quality of lipids by changing the length of the fatty acid carbon chain and its degree of unsaturation Medina et al. 1998 Miranda et al. 2012 . As natural mutagenesis needs sexual reproduction in the particular species and is often accomplished by crossing mutants to other strains. Sexual reproduction occurs naturally in higher plants so need of mutagenesis fulfil easily but it can occa sionally be difficult to occur in algae since the strains are often main tained asexually and the circumstances necessary for sexual reproduction are occasionally unknown. This barrier can be addressed in fundamental research by comparing the next-generation sequencing of the mutant genome to that of the original strain Dutcher et al. 2012 . An effective way to maximize the productivity of microalgal lipid and lower the cost of producing microalgal biofuels is to optimize environmental parameters and regulate the environment to enhance the synthesis of microalgal lipid. Therefore developing strains that can collect lipids without compromising growth or biomass output be accomplished by manipulating genes. Significant work has been done over the past ten years to develop genetically engineered strains and genetically modified tools. Adaptive laboratory evolution ALE random mutagenesis and direct genetic engineering are the methods used to modify genomes. To induce random mutations in microalgae researchers are examining the use of ALE chemical mutagens ethyl methanesulfonate EMS and N -nitro-N nitrosoguanidine NTG and physical mutagens such as x-rays gamma-rays and UV radiations Mu noz et al. 2021 . The bacterial adaptation CRISPR-Cas9 system which was discovered in 2013 is gaining a lot of interest. CRISPR RNA crRNA trans-activating crRNA tracrRNA or single synthetic guide RNA sgRNA precede the protospacer adjacent motif PAM in a simplified version of the type-II CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes. This allows the Cas9 nuclease to lead the DNA double-strand breaks DSBs in genomic DNA Ng et al. 2017 . In the subject of microalgal biotechnology Chlamydomonas rein hardtii nuclear transformation marked the first significant advancement in 1990. Cells were agitated in the presence of glass beads coated with DNA which allowed friction to create micropore-sized holes in the outer layer of the cell thus making it more direct for DNA molecules to penetrate the cell Kindle 1990 . Table 3 summarizes the approaches and tools designed to improve lipid production in microalgae including the PUFA TAG metabolism transcription factors FAS and Kennedy pathway. Green algae are mostly unicellular organisms that belong to the phylum Chlorophyta and are typically found in fresh aquatic environ ments. Green algae are distinguished from red and brown algae by the kinds of chlorophyll that each of them possesses. The numerous forms of chlorophyll present in algae impact the algae s physical appearance such as color. All algae are composed of chlorophyll a green algae are made up of chlorophyll b and red and brown algae are comprised of chlorophyll d and c respectively La. Although it cannot be found in every photosynthetic organism chlorophyll B helps plants absorb a greater spectrum of sunlight for photosynthesis Khoo et al. 2023 . Because of their substantial population densities and rapid growth rates green algae have become a favorite in the production and extraction of biofuel especially biodiesel Rastogi et al. 2018 . It has been discovered that whereas other algae have many acces sory pigments greater than their number of chlorophylls green algae have a comparatively higher number of chlorophylls in comparison to other pigments. This demonstrates that green algae outperform other forms of algae in terms of photosynthetic efficiency. Lipids make up more than 50 of the dry weight of biomass in certain green algae. The vast majority of the lipids in green algae are composed of TAGs as well as DAGs with additional substances including oil constituents and carot enoids McKie-Krisberg et al. 2018 . The neutral lipids preferred in the synthesis of biodiesel are TAGs and DAGs as the last and final step for lipid production and enhancement is the TAG development in algae Ng et al. 2017 . So the TAG synthesis pathway involves metabolic engi neering. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase G3PDH in microalgae initiates the transformation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate in the cytosol. Subsequently glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase GPAT induces the conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate to lysophosphatidic acid lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase LPAAT converts lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid phos phatidic acid phosphatase PAP catalyzes the process of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and last but not least diacylglycerol acyl transferase DGAT stimulates the transformation of diacylglycerol to triacylglycerol TAG in the endoplasmic reticulum ER Korkhovoy and Blume 2013 . In order to increase the lipid buildup in microalgae Hsieh Hsieh et al. 2012 employed an array of gene expression methods Hsieh et al. 2012 . As Saccharomyces cerevisiae and or Yarrowia lip olytica s G3PDH GPAT LPAAT PAP and DGAT were all overexpressed in concert Chlorella minutissima s lipid synthesis rose twofold as compared to cells of the wild type Hsieh et al. 2012 . Nowadays scientists tend to focus on genetic engineering pathways that seek to lengthen the chain of fatty acids by overexpressing genes related to fatty acid synthesis and simultaneously suppressing genes associated with lipase hydrolysis and β-oxidation. In a few years these advancements would enable the cost-effective manufacturing of algae biodiesel while simultaneously growing the output Chang et al. 2016 . Throughout the years fatty acid oxidation-related genes fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase acyl CoA synthase cacyl CoA oxidase and arniti neacyltransferase I have been the subject of investigation as has overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACCase which is involved in fatty acid production Liang and Jiang 2013 . Microalgae present a challenge for genetic engineering because methods of modification vary depending on the species and cannot be employed exactly due to codon occupancy defensive mechanisms such as methylation and restriction enzymes nucleic acid uptake and cell porosity. Consequently in order to modify microalga for the intended generation of biofuel a thorough understanding of the genetic makeup of each species is required Banerjee et al. 2018 . In order to use microalgae as a robust and renewable energy sub stratum on an industrial scale microalgal biotechnology emphasizes on three main areas a increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of the M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 10 algae through genetic engineering which leads to increased oil extrac tion and a boosted carbon storage rate in mass cultures b directing carbon flux into energy-rich compounds that can be used as a source of biofuel and c developing robust and dedicated algal cells that can support low-cost massive operations cultivation which lowers the operational expenses and the environmental impact of the substances developed Singh et al. 2015 . The objective of lipid engineering in microalgae is to create TAG that has improved cold flow characteristics which would make them a more suitable substrate for the generation of biodiesel. The ratio of C12 to C14 short-chain fatty acids was raised in the diatom P. tricornutum through higher levels of thioesterases sourced from multiple plant sources Radakovits et al. 2011 . Analogous endeavors have been conducted on C. reinhardtii wherein the fatty acid profile has been modified to enhance its fuel qualities Gong et al. 2011 . Recent research used reverse genetics to rationally modulate type II diacyl glycerol acyl transferases in Nannochloropsis oceanica resulting in the generation of TAG designer oils with a broad range of degrees of unsaturation Xin et al. 2017 . Through the insertion of desired metabolic pathways ge netic engineering not only enables researchers to change or modify metabolic pathway s but also reprograms cells. It is possible to adhere to the enzymatic potential in this case by transferring the relevant route from one organism to another Wheeldon et al. 2017 . By rewiring heterogeneous channels within a host system new metabolic networks are established. This allows for the building of efficient cell factories and produces desirable phenotypes by reorienting the cell s priority from growth to targeted output. Precursors of many biofuel molecules such as ethylene 1-butanol isoprene 2-methyl-1-butanol acetone and fatty acids have been effectively synthesized using such insertions. The findings listed above unequivocally demonstrate the potential contri bution of synthetic routes to the field of improving algae-based biofuel. The creation of computational tools like pathway prediction systems PPS makes pathway synthesis easier and can be applied to a variety of operations like the breakdown of xenobiotic chemicals and the gener ation of biofuel Jagadevan et al. 2018 . The TCA cycle in microalgae has been studied in detail recently revealing particular enzymes and flow control points that have aided attempts to increase energy gener ation and biofuel yield. Studies has reported that in order to boost photosynthetic activity Synechocystis 6803 s TCA cycle has been designed to redirect 10 of the carbon that is fixed into ethylene Xiong et al. 2015 . Furthermore in order to achieve increased acetate production an engineering method has been applied to the PP pathway channeling over twenty percent of carbon into the triose sink. NADPH and ribose-5- phosphate are produced by the PP pathway which works in tandem with glycolysis. Redox equilibrium and nucleotide synthesis depend on it. Researchers have found the PP pathway s essential enzymes and regulatory nodes offering new information on the metabolism of microalgae and their possible applications. Study revealed that Tha lassiosira pseudonana engineered a multifunctional lipase phospholi pase acyltransferase has a lipid content that is 3.3 times higher Trentacoste et al. 2013 . Increasing the lipid content of microalgae can be effectively achieved by engineering the lipid pathway. The over expression of genes to raise lipid product in the lipid pathway has been investigated in a number of research. The Kennedy route has four steps for the production of TAG. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACCase a limiting Table 3 Strategies and tools employed for the enhancement of lipid production in microalgae with targeted genes highlighted.

The two biochemical routes that result in the creation of isoprenoids are the methyl-erythritol-4-phosphate MEP pathway which is found in plant plastids and is of prokaryotic bacterial source and the mevalonic acid system which functions in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes and archaea. The ability to precisely catalyze the final dedicated step in isoprene biosynthesis is not present in cyanobacteria. Their expression of the MEP pathway and use of the related enzymes allows them to synthesize a wide range of essential terpenoid-type compounds. Plants produce isoprene because of the isoprene synthase IspS gene a nuclear gene that codes for a protein located in the chloroplast which triggers the synthesis of dimethylallyl diphosphate DMAPP to isoprene. The production of photosynthetic isoprene in these cyanobacteria was effectively facilitated by heterologous expression of the Pueraria mon tana kudzu isoprene synthase IspS gene in the MEP pathway of Synechocystis sp Lindberg et al. 2010 . To offset the expenses microalgae are genetically modified to enhance yield and product quality. This approach focuses mostly on altering metabolic pathways to either overexpress or suppress specific genes in order to improve biomass and achieve the intended product yield. A microalgae cell develops through the production of other mol ecules such as proteins through the encoding of genes found in DNA. DNA encompasses genetic information which is translated into RNA. Proteins are created from RNA and these complexes and catalysts serve the organism as an entire entity. In order to alter a gene toward a buildup of the intended products and results the network connecting genomes is being examined Neto et al. 2019 Norashikin et al. 2018 . The first step in the genetic engineering method is to choose and gather a gene with a desirable characteristic from the donor organism s DNA that typically carries the particular gene. The vector plasmid DNA is then extracted from a different organism usually a bacterium. Following that the enzyme that fragments DNA is combined with the donor and plasmid DNA. The DNA fragments unite chemically resulting in a new fully functional plasmid. This gene from the donor organism is now present in this plasmid DNA. The new plasmids containing the new gene are then either implanted or transformed into the bacterial cells. Later when the new gene-containing bacteria are cultivated in enormous quantities the intended outcomes become apparent Huang et al. 2022 . It is evident that green algae possess the identical job as bacteria in this scenario. Further genome editing which includes gene insertion deletion mutations knockout and knockdown is an essential component of ge netic alteration Fayyaz et al. 2020 . Recombinant nucleases are incorporated by the Clustered Regularly Interspaces Short Palindromic Repeat CRISPR to produce DSBs. A guide RNA gRNA and the nuclease Cas9 protein interact to create a complex. The Cas9 gRNA intricately searches for the target sequence that has to be altered when the gRNA identifies it Moreb and Lynch 2021 . The target sequence was identified by Saey Musunuru 2021 the Cas9 protein breaks down it and a DSB forms at the location. After that DSB is repaired by a process known as non-homologous end joining NHEJ which results in cleavage site modifications. In addition Cas9 and gRNA complexes can be introduced into cells forming ribonucleo proteins Cas9 RNPs to lower the likelihood of cytotoxicity and off-targeting Jeon et al. 2017 . With Tetraselmis sp. a particular kind of green marine microalgae Chang Chang et al. 2020 effectively employed this strategy by modifying the strain s ADP-glucose pyro phosphorylase AGP protein which resulted in a significant rise in lipid production. Lipid content rose by 2.7 and 3.1 times or 21.1 as well as 24.1 dry cell volume respectively. Fig. 6 provides an instance of the CRISPR mechanism. 6. Biofuel production using cultivated microalgae 6.1. Biofuel through transesterification process It is assumed that the direct transesterification method offers greater benefits in terms of boosting the efficiency of microalgae-derived bio diesel. By employing a number of steps including oil-extraction and transesterification followed by a purification technique to produce biodiesel which can serve as a fruitful alternative to fossil fuels as shown in Fig. 8 B . Alcohol is notable because it acts both as a reactant and a solvent in a transesterification process. Because methanol is more readily available and less expensive than other types of alcohol it is often used in this process. The limited solubility of alcohol in various oils makes the use of a catalyst more important. Borugadda and Goud 2012 Stumborg et al. 1996 . In the marketplace for biodiesel produc tion algae compete with other alternatives giving insights into future oil demand. It deserves to be emphasized that regardless of the kind of oil being researched catalysts are essential to the biodiesel-forming process Hannon et al. 2010 . However algal oil exhibits a note worthy propensity to transform into diesel-spectrum esters. Therefore when enzymatic catalysts are employed biodiesel yield from algal strains nearly hits 100 as show in Table 4. Fig. 6. Mechanism of CRISPR modified from El-Mounadai El-Mounadi et al. 2020 . M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 12 6.1.1. Transesterification with lipases Compared to acid and alkali procedures lipase-catalyzed trans esterification produces glycerol with a greater level of purity. The sole known instance of lipase-catalyzed biodiesel generation from algal biomass is follow-up research on a large-scale biodiesel project using heterotrophically growing C. protothecoides. An effective attempt to produce biodiesel through enzymatic transesterification with Candida sp. 99 125 lipase immobilized on macroporous resin Malihan et al. 2012 Zhu et al. 2018 was complemented by an outstanding scale-up investigation involving biological reactor generation from high-lipid-producing algae Li et al. 2007 from a 5 L bench-top reactor to a 11 000-L commercial bioreactor operated in batch mode. The ideal parameters for this reaction are relatively similar to those found forother feedstocks Koçer and Ozçimen 2018 Rold an-San Antonio and Martín 2023 a high catalyst load a 3 1 methanol-to-oil ratio restriction and the application of n-hexane as the co-solvent to shield the enzyme from methanol poisoning. Over the course of a 12-h process the catalysis temperature was maintained at 38 C and the pH at 7.0. These numbers should be optimized for every enzyme because they are extremely lipase-dependent. Nevertheless the primary obstacle to the commer cialization of lipase-catalyzed biodiesel synthesis is the high cost of the catalyst which prohibits this method from being produced on a large scale. The process of developing new methods for turning algae into biodiesel has advanced. Recently a promising physicochemical method for turning wet algal biomass into biodiesel was revealed Patil et al. 2011 . After 25-min of conversion a yield surpassing 90 was obtained from the transesterification of Nannochloropsis sp. wet biomass comprising 90 water in supercritical methanol at a temperature of around 255 C and a pressure of 1200 psi 8.27 MPa . The methanol-to-algal ratio was 9 1 w v . The McGyan process a different approach to producing biodiesel utilizing supercritical methanol as well as porous titania microspheres has been effectively applied to a range of oils recovered using hexane from dried powdered algal feedstocks. 85 of the biomass from kelp Dunaliella tertiolecta N. oculata and wild cultures was converted to biodiesel. In a reactor that had 1 3 96 w w w lipids methanol and hexane transesterification was carried out continuously at 340 C 2250 pressure 15.5 MPa and 30 s of reactor residence time Daroch et al. 2013 . 6.1.2. Use of nano-carbon particles in biodiesel production Another method for turning lipids into biodiesel is to use the po tential of nanocarbon particles. Because of its disposal issues traditional transesterification pollutes the environment and employs inorganic catalysts. As a result greener alternatives such as enzymes can function Fig. 7. Global biodiesel superpowers setting the standard for sustainable fuels. Fig. 8. Production of bioethanol and biodiesel by saccharification and transesterification from algal biomass respectively. M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 13 as more effective supplements. For the purpose of producing biodiesel natural catalysts are also handled and lipases have emerged as a market niche as a result Thangaraj et al. 2019 . According to reports Borugadda and Goud 2012 were capable of transesterifying Nannochloropsis oculate at 50 C with a very high transformation rate of 97.5 with the aid of CaO and Al2O3 catalysts. Furthermore it was shown that the transesterification of green micro algae at 350 400 C and 2500 psi pressure could be accomplished with a 90.2 conversion efficiency by using Zn Ti and Al-based catalysts Anitescu and Bruno 2012 . A number of countries have started using biofuels to power their future with their native plants being selected as key feedstocks. As of 2018 the top three countries are the United States 380888 TMT Brazil 21375 TMT and Indonesia 4849 TMT . These countries are the top contributers in producing the biodiesel as shown in Fig. 7. Terravia Holdings formerly known as Solazyme Algenol Blue Marble Production Culture Biosystem Organization Oil Inc. Proviron Industries Solix Biofuel and Reliance Life Science are a few of the firms working on algal diesel. For each acre of algal harvest the enormous Florida Company Algenol whose stock is valued at 3.1 million gen erates 8000 gallons of biofuel annually. One hundred 100 barrels of biodiesel are delivered daily by Reliance an Indian company. Devel oping nations such as India are setting up biofuel operations and Wil liamson Magor Bio Fuel Limited North East India and Oils of the United Kingdom are starting a joint venture. Biodiesel derived from jatropha oil and its composition and properties through the transesterification pro cess as well as the corresponding values of several standards Stumborg et al. 1996 . 6.1.3. Supercritical transesterification Triglycerides combine with supercritical alcohols mainly methanol and ethanol in a process known as supercritical transesterification to produce biodiesel. Manufacturing costs are high because of the excessive use of alcohol at a molar ratio of 42 1 instead of 3 1 as is the case with typical procedures. The advantage of this process is that it takes less than 10 min to convert triglycerides to methyl esters. High temperatures cause a secondary reaction involving unsaturated and esters of glycerol which improves fuel quality Hidalgo et al. 2015 Faeth and Savage 2016 . 6.1.4. Use of nano-catalysts in transesterification Traditionally enzymatic catalysts such as KOH NaOH zeolites li pases and others have been used to create biodiesel. However because of its advantages over homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalysts which are often utilized the current research trend uses nano-catalysts in the process of transesterification. Additionally the CaO nano particle performance demonstrates a 96 increase in biodiesel output from 93 Gupta and Agarwal 2016 . As demonstrated by the study on the effect of CaO and MgO heterogenic nanocatalyst pairing on trans esterification reaction effectiveness which produced biodiesel with a yield of 98.95 of mass coupled catalyst repeatability is superior to nano CaO alone Tahvildari et al. 2015 . The highest FAME yield of 99.0 was obtained over 3 wt weight percent of Ca OCH3 2 nano calcium methoxide catalyst loading at a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 30 1 and a reaction duration of 3 h at 80 C Teo et al. 2016 . 6.2. Saccharification Prior pretreatment studies have demonstrated that it is possible to successfully recover numerous brown seaweeds with high sugar con centrations Malihan et al. 2012 . It needs an efficient pretreatment to release the polysaccharides. A few of the chemical or physical pre treatment methods for biomass that are now accessible are hot water pretreatment alkaline wet oxidation steam explosion acid hydrolysis and green solvents such as ionic liquids Kumar et al. 2009 . How ever in order to release the monosaccharides an enzymatic saccharifi cation procedure is required. As a result the quantity of fermentable monosaccharides that could be extracted from algae can be increased by Table 4 Biodiesel production with various enzyme catalysts. High amounts of lipid conversion are achieved during transesterification processes by using enzyme catalysts.

Monosaccharides are formed when alginate is saccharified. These be utilized to generate biofuels and a variety of interesting products including gelling agents stabilizers and viscosi fiers for the alimentary beverage paper biomaterials and pharmaceutical sectors. It is prefer able to utilize enzymes to saccharify these polysaccharides since they be hydrolyzed under moderate circumstances preventing the buildup of unwanted byproducts and lowering the risk of environmental contami nation. Alginate is the primary carbohydrate found in brown algae. Ascophyllum Laminaria and Macrocystis are the three taxa of algae that provide the majority of the alginate used commercially Cad ee 1992 . 6.2.1. Saccharification with cellulases Samples containing 0.1 g of algae were subjected to incubation with a commercial cellulase enzyme complex for saccharification. The enzyme complex included β-glucosidase 10 U g algae and cellulases from Sigma Celluclast 10 FPU g algae was calculated as described by Ghose 1987 1U of movement has been defined as the total amount of enzyme necessary to undergo hydrolysis 1 μmol of p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside per minute at pH 4.0 and 37 C . Using citric acid disodium hydrogen phosphate McIlvaine buffer the ideal pH was found by incubating the mixture for 4 h at 50 C in a pH range of 4.8 7.5. It was examined how temperature affected the activity of the enzymes. The specimens were incubated at 28.5 37 and 50 C for 4 h in McIlvaine buffer pH 5.2. Saccharification of cellulose was typically carried out at pH 5.2 50 C with stirring 200 rpm and centrifugation. Three sets of the enzyme-mediated saccharification of algae were carried out. The Kit RandoxGluc-PAP was utilized to quantify glucose Ravanal et al. 2016 . 6.2.2. Saccharification with alginases Samples comprising 0.1 g of seaweed were treated with 3U g of Sigma s endo-type enzyme alginate lyase in order to saccharify the algae using alginases. 1U of oligoalginate lyase an exo-type enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to liberate 1 μmol of uronic acid per minute at pH 7.5 and 37 C. The enzyme was kindly provided by BAL Company. The absorbance was evaluated at 235 nm per 60-s per ml of sodium alginate solution at pH 6.3 and 37 C due to the formation of 4 5-unsaturated oligogalacturonates by β-elimination. After 2 h of incubation at 37 C the ideal pH was found in McIlvaine buffer in the pH range of 5.4 8.0. It was examined how temperature affected the activity of the enzymes. Samples were incubated in McIl vaine buffer pH 7.5 at 28 32 37 and 50 C for 2 h. For this sacchar ification pH 7.5 at 37 C with 200 rpm stirring and centrifugation were the usual conditions. Uronic acid monosaccharides and certain oli goalginates with varying molecular weights are the principal products of saccharification of alginate using alginate lyase as well as oligoalginate lyase. Three separate batches of the algae were used for the enzymatic saccharification process Ravanal et al. 2016 . So the bioethanol s production from several Algal strains by employing different pretreat ment methods and enzymes under controlled conditions of temperature and time duration is discussed in Table 5. This Ravanal et al. 2016 research focuses on enzymatic sacchar ification using cellulases and alginases with a special emphasis on the renewable chemical precursors glucose and uronic acid found in M. pyrifera. Cellulases and alginases were used in tests to find the ideal conditions for the enzyme-mediated saccharification process after the algae had been pretreated using water for 1 h at 120 C. 7. Biogas production using microalgae Biogas is a flammable and toxic gas generated from organic waste biomass such as lignocellulose waste grass and plant waste aquatic trash microbiological waste kitchen waste and macro-algae. The biomass utilized in the anaerobic digestion process in addition to its operating conditions such as pH pressure temperature and acidity usually dictate the chemical makeup of biogas however methane carbon dioxide N2 H2 water and residues of hydrogen sulfide H2S are typically present in biogas Pooja et al. 2022 Hosseini et al. 2020 . Biogas made from algal wastes is gaining popularity due to its high volatile solids content which allows for large-scale production of renewable energy with minimal carbon footprint and adverse environ mental effects while remaining economically feasible Jafari Olia et al. 2022 Ramanan et al. 2016 . Several steps of producing biogas utilizing algae biomass are involved including the algae pre-treatment process stage and the anaerobic digestion stage which begins with anaerobic digestion in the anaerobic unit to produce digestate and biogas. Carbon dioxide is put into ponds as a source of carbon for algae cultivation. While algal oil is transesterified by employing syngas to supply the required methanol the algae require CO2 to thrive. In the absence of oxygen microorganisms break down sludge or manure in an anaerobic digester bioreactor . The processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis aceto genesis and methanogenesis are continuous simultaneous reactions that convert the original material carbohydrates lipids and proteins into both carbon dioxide and methane gasses Rold an-San Antonio and Martín 2023 . 7.1. Anaerobic digestion The process of anaerobic digestion AD converts algae like seaweed into biogas that can be used to remediate wastewater Jafari et al. 2021 Assemany et al. 2020 . Through this process organic biomass which includes plants and algae is converted into a carbon dioxide and methane mixture that can be employed as an environmen tally friendly fertilizer. In sustainable agriculture digestate which is also created during anaerobic digestion can take the place of inorganic fertilizers. For the purpose of valorizing wet materials with a high moisture content like algae anaerobic digestion operates efficiently. Bacteria break down organic substrates into gases primarily carbon dioxide and methane with trace amounts of N2 O2 NH3 hydrogen sulfide siloxanes and halogenated hydrocarbon Hagos et al. 2017 . Bacterial anaerobic digestion results in the production of CO2 water Table 5 Bioethanol production by selected micro-algal strains under controlled conditions of temperature and duration.

Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 15 ammonia hydrogen sulfide and methane gas Ziemi nski 2012 . Microalgae have drawn interest for being capable of recovering nitrogen from AD effluent and upgrading biogas. They enable the bioremediation of digestate and nutrient-rich liquid digestate. Compared to cultivate algae individually co-cultivating bacteria and microalgae can generate biomass more efficiently and remove more nutrients Roberts et al. 2020 . However diverse microorganisms metabolisms can impose limitations on one another creating a complicated environment. Important operating parameters need to be selected in order to optimize an anaerobic digestion process Zhang et al. 2020a . Biogas production can be increased by pretreatment techniques such as mechanical ther mal microwave and enzymatic. The present focus of the study is on improving biogas from swine wastewater treated with AD by employing microalgae. Microalgae are a possible method for upgrading biogas because it has been demonstrated that they can eliminate over 99 of hydrocarbons from biogas Abusweireh et al. 2023 . Table 6 highlights the broad range of biofuel production by dis playing different algal strains their associated yields and their pro duction in various cultivation environment. Autotrophic growth nutrient inputs carbon source introduction temperature control and an appropriate pH are all required for photo bioreactor based production. 7.2. Bio-hydrogen production from microalgae Methods for producing biohydrogen from microalgae are fermenta tion and photosynthesis. Direct photolysis H2 photo-dark fermenta tion H2 indirect photolysis H2 and dark fermentation H2 come in order of highest yield and output produced by modified genetically designed strains. The photosynthetic system s PSII dependence on H2 generation nutritional deprivation of H2 production and anaerobic biohydrogen synthesis during dark fermentation are the three mecha nisms for biohydrogen production. Since sulfur shortages reduce both PSII activity and the rate at which oxygen is produced it has been proven to be the most efficient method of producing biohydrogen. Because oxygen is used up during normal mitochondrial respiration hydrogenase is activated in an anaerobic state in order to catalyze the production of biohydrogen Wang et al. 2021 . There are various methods to boost biohydrogen production efficiency such as algae-bacteria coupling Iqbal et al. 2022 and immobilization of microalgae cells to improve light utilization Ruiz-Marin et al. 2020 . 7.3. Enhancing the yield of bio-hydrogen production via genetic engineering Microalgae have been genetically engineered to produce more Table 6 List of algae species their cultivation conditions and the yields of the various kinds of biofuels they produce.

Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 16 biohydrogen. The objective is to make hydrogenase more resistant to oxygen however so far this has not been accomplished through modification of the structure of hydrogenase. Because pyruvate oxidase in Escherichia coli catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate which utilizes O2 hydrogenase activity can be sustained in the absence of oxygen. So the scientists put the pyruvate oxidase and catalase genes from Escherichia coli into the chloroplast genome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This created the new transgenic algae strain which produces three times as much biohydrogen Xu et al. 2011 . O2 can suppress the expression and functioning of the hydrogenase gene HydA in the PSII system resulting in enhanced biohydrogen yields. Inhibiting PsbO gene expression inhibits the release of oxygen while inducing HydA in the PSII system. By eliminating the PsbO gene the rate of biohydrogen synthesis is increased about 9 times Lin et al. 2013 . To achieve a balance between photosynthesis and respiration photosynthesis must be minimized while respiration is enhanced Ghirardi et al. 2018 . Furthermore by preventing phosphorylation activation glycolaldehyde can impair the Calvin Benson cycle enabling cells to stay anaerobic for biohydrogen evolution. Hydrogenase s structure is capable of being altered to boost resistance to oxygen with scientists changing particular amino acids to prevent oxygen from entering through the pathway and protecting the active core Christenson and Sims 2011 Hoh et al. 2016 . A bioengineering ferredoxin coupled with hydrogenase has been developed to increase the rate of biohydrogen generation Wang et al. 2021 . Inhibiting RuBisCO weakens the Calvin-Benson cycle which pro motes electron-to-hydrogenase transfer. RuBisCO large and small sub unit mutants had faster biohydrogen evolution rates than S-deficient regular forms Antal et al. 2011 . Reducing the size of the antennae can improve light gathering efficiency Hu et al. 2020 and biohydrogen generation. Hup-hydrogenase subunit knockout can minimize bio hydrogen utilization. Under conditions of darkness particular inhibitors can transfer electrons to reversible Hox hydrogenase or nitrogenase to boost H2 generation Burrows et al. 2011 . By not transferring 90 of light that is absorbed to Photosynthetic system PSII light harvesting complexes LHCs can lower the efficiency of production Oh et al. 2011 . This barrier can be bypassed by randomly incorporating mutant nuclear coding antenna genes or modifying antenna regulatory protein NAB1 using LHC antenna engineering. Another option is to use RNAi to knock down LHCs or chlorophyll production genes in order to opti mize H2 yield Oey et al. 2016 . 8. Bottlenecks challenges and future prospects in biofuel production from microalgae 8.1. Microalgae s challenges in commercial applications Since it is feasible to confirm the natural existence of microorganisms in a variety of conditions microalgal development generally appears to be straightforward yet the commercial transformation of biomass into biologically sustainable and ecofriendly biofuels is complicated but worth it. Microalgae are known to need light energy and sources of CO2 for self-sustaining growth organic supplies for heterotrophic develop ment and an intermediate state known as mixotrophic growth. There are a number of intermediate trophic pathways between the two ex tremes according to a publication Kandasamy et al. 2024 . Autotro phic growth nutrient inputs carbon source introduction temperature control and an appropriate pH are all required for photobioreactor based production. This study Aci en et al. 2012 states that in order to implement cultivation methods at commercial and industrial scales costs must be lowered down. Photobioreactors are a good substitute although optimal material selection and design simplicity are required. However light is required for the photosynthesis process of autotrophic algae and illumination of photo-bioreactor result in greater energy consumption as well as a larger surface area for the shallow cultivation of microalgae Carneiro et al. 2017 Singh and Olsen 2011 . Utilizing combustion gases and wastewater is an additional alter native that decreases the labor or employment and energy costs asso ciated with production. Since the aforementioned factors all entail direct financial costs careful consideration of production options is required. In order to prevent inessential costs and investor money loss Patrick Moriarty and Honnery 2024 states that these elements are critical to the planning and launch of a microalgae firm. Great volumes of nutrients and water are required for microalgal cultivation which frequently re sults in expensive production expenses and makes it challenging to introduce microalgal bio-fuels on an industrial level. The construction of an association for microalgae growing in freshwater effluent or another environment containing accessible organic compounds while under taking bioremediation however is a promising choice to overcome this problem Kang et al. 2015 . Using open-pound systems like the Algae Turf Scrubber Witarsa et al. 2020 is an additional way to reduce ex penditures and boost yield. This system is based on coral reef algal colonies. Artificial or natural light sources can be used to facilitate growth. One of this system s primary benefits is its high rate of biomass generation which outperforms other harvesting systems in terms of production yields. Numerous contaminants are taken up by the biomass of algae and can be eliminated by the system itself. The biomass can be processed into materials of economic importance including fertilizers and animal feed provided that harmful chemicals are absent Cheenakula et al. 2023 . It is anticipated that the generation and application of biofuels would increase on a global scale. However generally especially in the trans portation sector the contribution to overall energy consumption will remain modest. This is mostly because arable land usage is competing with the production of fiber and food products developing markets lack properly regulated agricultural practices market systems are geographically limited and biodiversity protection is essential Noraini et al. 2014 . Numerous research attempted to enhance the production in order to lower costs while using microalgae as the basis of bioproducts. Using a life cycle analysis a study Golberg et al. 2021 looked at the sustainability of algal bio-crude production from an economic social and environmental standpoint. A good substitute is bio-crude some times referred to as bio-oil which is made by hydrothermally liquefying semi-dry biomass and then distilling it into its constituent fractions in a refinery Golberg et al. 2021 . According to the findings producing 1-million tons of bio-crude lead to the generation of about 13 000 job opportunities and a boost to the economy of US 4 billion. Over the past ten years above figure shows how the search engine results have changed in connection to microalgae and the economy. It was confirmed by bibliometric research that the primary obstacle facing microalgae in industrial applications is their production cost. Impor tant factors that need to be taken into account in this sector were linked to this term including industrial scale commercialization economy high cost economic viability major bottleneck and others. These findings show that the outlook for microalgal based biological goods is more promising in terms of the conditions that would allow for the industrial-scale commercialization of bioproducts. Nevertheless considering the facts it is impossible to ignore the factors aimed at achieving economic viability and lowering energy costs these are the primary obstacles that need to be addressed. 8.2. Future prospects The development of new effective and appropriate growing tech nology mostly for offshore culture for all kinds of microalgae and macroalgae is essential for its effective growth as is raising the public s awareness of and acceptance of the phases that comprise algal devel opment. Cyanobacteria are potentially the most common among them in terms of producing biofuels. Transesterification is a process by which numerous kinds of microalgae transform fat into biodiesel to replace petro-based fuels fossil-fuels . In terms of density and viscosity bio diesel made from microalgal is comparable to petroleum diesel and M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 17 these types of microorganisms require the use of chemicals in contrast to higher plants which require pesticides and herbicides to produce more. The high concentration of proteins and carbohydrates in micro algae that be processed to produce methanol and alcohol fuel is another characteristic of these algae McGinn et al. 2011 . Global fuel con sumption and demand are predicted to increase quickly and the use of fossil fuels has a negative influence on the environment and poses serious problems. The world has paid close attention to the present global energy problem. The world s energy problem must be resolved with the help of renewable energy sources See Fig. 9 . One great form of renewable energy that be created without relying on fossil fuels is bio fuels which are made from biological organisms Rodionova et al. 2017 . The process s recuperation rate or energy balance is also essential for every species. It includes raising and expanding the pro duction of biomass and the potential value of biofuels while lowering operating and investment costs which include staff equipment and energy inputs . However it is claimed that under typical operating circumstances the majority of microalgal ponds possess a solar energy generation efficiency of 1 4 closed photo-bioreactor systems can attain greater efficiencies. Enhanced breeding initiatives and genetic modification are being used to try to close the large margin for improvement which is estimated to be 8 12 respectively for the ideal maximum efficiency of photosynthesis for transforming solar en ergy to oil as well as hydrogen Stephens et al. 2010 . There are now 447 algae and Spirulina spp.-producing plants in Europe. Throughout the European countries a wide range of species production techniques and industrial applications have been identified. The majority of algae production systems in Europe 68 of the mapped production units involve the harvesting of wild stocks Robak et al. 2018 . There are now 309 permits in Norway for the cultivation of macroalgae with around half of them being granted for the kelp species S. latissima L. digitata and A. esculenta . The most commercially sig nificant species at this time is S. latissima. With a market value of almost 74 000 Euro the 145 tons of kelp produced in 2017 were valued at Gegg and Wells 2017 . As the main suppliers of macroalgal biomass for biorefinery East Asian countries China Korea Japan Indonesia and the Philippines would need to work together internationally to advance and develop their agricultural technology and experience Ol ah et al. 2020 . This cooperation would be directed toward improving the mac roalgal biorefinery. These nations provided 95 of the global supply in 2010. Due to biological factors including climate the predominant species produced in each country vary. Approximately 85 and 30 of the worldwide cultivation of L. japonica and U. pinnatifida respectively was grown in China and Korea Giugni and Giugni 2010 . While other red algae were mostly farmed in Indonesia as well as the Philippines Porphyra sp. was principally grown in Japan Lam et al. 2019 . Because of their decades-long agricultural expertise East Asian nations will be crucial in increasing the quantity of macroalgae grown globally for use as feedstock in biorefineries. Future temperature pH and other pre diction sensors be more favored which prompted the development of Internet-based integrated electrical technologies and control systems for macroalgal growth systems. These days microalgal cultivation systems use this kind of technology Tamilarasan and Sahadevan 2014 . 9. Life cycle assessment It is claimed that a number of biofuels are capable of being produced from algal biomass. Therefore a range of conversion methods have been used in third and fourth generation biofuel manufacturing processes that employ microalgae to reach large-scale commercialization. i Cultiva tion ii Harvesting iii Pre-treatment iv Transesterification and v Purification comprise the traditional microalgae production method. Human activities emit CO2 into the atmosphere causing an imbalance in nature as GHGs are highly involved in global warming or climate change globally Saranya and Ramachandra 2020 . The entire life cycle assessment of biofuels has been illustrated from human activities to the production of biofuels in Fig. 10. On contrary to that open ponds as well as closed photobioreactors Weyer et al. 2010 are used in microalgae s cultivation as they consume environmental CO2 in the photosynthesis and respirational processes of algal growth and development resultantly algae s bio processing and refining comes into play to harness biofuels from algal biomass although connected biofilm cultivation has drawn attention as well recently. It is observed that Rubio Rodríguez et al. Rubio Rodríguez et al. 2011 conducted LCA research to value alternative energy routes and came to the conclusion that LCA-based indicators might be a useful tool for comparing alternative energy routes with respect to their impact on the environment and the indirect costs of natural resources for various commodities and services. Yang et al. 2011 evaluated the microalgae-based biodiesel manufacturing proc ess s life-cycle water as well as nutrient consumption. Following the growth of microalgae cells are extracted using a variety of energy-intensive cell concentration processes including centrifugation gravity sedimentation filtering flocculation and floatation Mathimani and Mallick 2018 . A variety of cell disruption methods including sonication bead pounding autoclaving microwave therapy and pulsed electric field are included in pre-treatment Ramachandra et al. 2013 . Following pre-treatment the cells undergo transesterification with the aid of supercritical CO2 acid alkali or biocatalysts to speed up the process Fukuda et al. 2001 . Purification is the last stage in the Fig. 9. Sustainable approach based on circular bio-economy for bioenergy production from microalgae aiming to reduce CO2 emissions and waste. M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 18 manufacturing of biodiesel. Technologies such as water washing or dry washing are typically used to purify crude biodiesel that contains traces of catalyst and crude glycerol Atadashi 2015 . Evaluations of the life cycle and energy balance of the microalgae-based biodiesel production process are crucial for determining the effects of the upstream micro algal culture as well as the downstream biofuel production processes. Prior studies on the life cycle assessment LCA of microalgal biofuels concentrated on comparing the effects with fossil fuels and other bio fuels as well as qualitative studies of various methodological factors such as system limitations and the allocation of co-products Collotta et al. 2016 Regarding this a previous study Carneiro et al. 2017 examined the environmental impact of biodiesel derived from micro algae versus other earth-based substrates or feedstocks bioethanol and traditional petroleum-based fuels. It found that the biodiesel obtained from microalgae was significantly more effective than the other terres trial substrates at reducing the effects of land use. In a research the amount of water and nutrients used during the synthesis of microalgal biodiesel was measured Singh and Olsen 2011 . If freshwater is utilized without recycling 3726 kg of water is needed to produce 1 kg of microalgal biodiesel. According to the findings employing wastewater or saltwater can cut the amount of freshwater used over the life cycle by up to 90 . Nevertheless regardless of whether wastewater or marine waters are employed as the medium for cultivation or how much harvested water is recycled a significant quantity of freshwater about 400 kg of biofuel needs to be needed for culture. Additionally researchers claimed that in the absence of harvest water recycling the life-cycle utilizations of nitrogen phosphorus magnesium potassium and sulfur were about 0.330 0.710 0.580 0.270 and 0.150 kg of biodiesel. On the other hand there is a reduction of about 55 in the use of these nutrients when the processed water is entirely recycled. Algal culture using saltwater or seawater can remove the requirement for potassium and sulfur as well as cut nitrogen demand by 94 . Overall as temperature and solar radiation rise the aquatic footprint of producing biodiesel from microalgae steadily shrinks from north to south Singh and Olsen 2011 . Chlorella vulgaris a microalga found in open raceway ponds was found to have a life cycle energy as well as greenhouse gas GHG analysis that was 2.5 times more energy-intensive than conventional diesel. This finding emphasizes the need for decarbonization throughout the entire production chain to fully realize the positive ecological effects of reducing GHG emissions through biomass Shirvani et al. 2011 . An increase in greenhouse gas emissions was found in the life cycle assessment of three distinct cell pre-treatment strategies on the ocean microalga Isochrysis galbana. This finding implies that different pre-treatment processes should be used in tandem to minimize envi ronmental impacts and improve energy efficiency Wang et al. 2017 . According to a comprehensive life cycle assessment LCA of C. vulgaris algae biodiesel production up to 90 of the entire method s energy was used during drying and hexane extraction Lardon et al. 2009 . According to these findings it seems unlikely that drying algae biomass and using it in place of terrestrial oilseeds in conventional solvent extraction as well as subsequent transesterification procedures will result in a net energy gain for the generation of sustainable biofuels Levine et al. 2010 . Jorquera Jorquera et al. 2010 conducted an analysis of the energy life-cycle for biomass production employing the oil-rich microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. This Singh and Olsen 2011 Fig. 10. The illustration of the green journey life cycle assessment of algae biofuel. M. Abdullah et al. Environmental Research 262 2024 119902 19 research comprised raceway ponds and tubular as well as flat-plate photobioreactors PBRs enabling algal culture. For every process the resulting net energy ratio NER was computed. The findings indicated that the predicted NERs for raceway ponds and flat-plate PBRs are 1 whereas the usage of horizontally tubular PBRs would not be financially viable NER 1 . If the biomass s lipid content were boosted to 60 dw cwd the NER for ponds and flat-plate PBRs be raised to noticeably higher values Singh and Olsen 2011 . To recapitulate it all it can be claimed that human activities emit CO2 into the atmosphere causing an imbalance in nature as GHGs are highly involved in climate change or global warming globally Saranya and Ramachandra 2020 . On contrary to that open ponds as well as closed photobioreactors Weyer et al. 2010 are used in microalgae s cultivation as they consume environmental CO2 in the photosynthesis and respirational processes of algal growth and development making the atmosphere quite ecofriendly. Resultantly algae s bioprocessing and refining comes into play to harness biofuels from algal biomass. Therefore minimizing energy inputs while increasing the efficiency of biomass and energy output is the key to producing microalgal biofuels in a way that is environmentally friendly. The purpose of this study was to assess the life cycle as well as environmental effects of a substrate-based microalgal fermenter when various nutrient sources were taken into account for the microalgae s development. This study aims to examine all aspects of the energy and environmental performance of microalgal biofuel from feedstock cultivation to bioethanol biodiesel biogas and jet-fuel synthesis in contrast to previous life cycle evaluation studies on microalgae.

The existence of carbon dioxide in the ecosystem is primarily due to the fossil fuel combustion from the variety of energy-driven vehicles. Hence to reduce its levels in the atmosphere and to prevent the depletion of non-renewable resources scientific researchers have made significant attempts to provide alternate and sustainable ways of producing energy. One such noteworthy effort is the biofuel production from the microalgae that has an excellent potential in lipid accumulation and bioconversion. Despite numerous reports are available on the effective biofuel production the process scaling-up and its commercialization remains in vain. Hence the present review is intended to critically identify the possible gaps in the current research and to provide potential challenges to be scientifically addressed in the prospective research of biofuel production. 1. Introduction The global energy crisis as well as increased amount of greenhouse gas emissions has led to the interest in alternative eco-friendly sources of renewable energy. Fuel derived from biomass has become the most promising renewable energy source when especially in comparison to solar hydro and wind energy because it can be easily preserved and trans-located and used straight in vehicles 1 2 . In the close future biofuel derived from living biomass is widely accepted as an alternative and green fuel source for sustainable energy production 3 . Biodiesel has numerous benefits over fossil diesel including the fact that it is biodegradable and nontoxic as well as produce lower greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels developed from photosynthetic organism-based biomasses such as terrestrial crops and algal species offer tremendous potential for meeting global energy demand while still being carbon neutral and allowing CO2 carbon dioxide sequestration from the environment 4 . A promising strategy is to produce the most appropriate energy carrier from algae. Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that have piqued the attention of researchers government officials and in dustrial owners 5 . Microalgae biofuels are a type of third-generation biofuel that can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels without the drawbacks of first and second-generation biofuels 6 . Due to its simple and cost effective cultivation system microalgae are one of the most suitable alternatives for a wide range of biofuels. They can easily grow with only light as a source of energy and basic nutrients such as air water and mineral salts. Furthermore on a land area basis these photosynthetic organisms are capable of fixing solar energy into biomass effectively than terrestrial plants 7 . Numerous micro algal species store a significant amount of lipids in the form of triacylglycerol TAG a preferred source of biofuel that can account for up to 70 of dry weight basis in some species 1 .

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Fuel journal homepage Received 29 May 2022 Received in revised form 24 September 2022 Accepted 30 September 2022 Fuel 332 2023 126199 2 Dunaliella primolecta Chlorella sp. and Crypthecodinium cohnii are just a few of the microalgae that produce a lot of hydrocarbons and lipids and have a capability of producing biofuel. The approach of cultivating microalgae was brought into focus for the production of biofuels with a number of potential benefits like those of i they did not conflict with food chains of humans or animals ii they were very rich of carbon- based products protein and oil and iii they were able to grow in aquatic media such as waste water freshwater salt water and nutrients from brackish water salt water or high polished water iv grown in waste dumping sea ponds rivers waste drainage in industrial and municipal waste areas wet bare lands v develop sustainable O2 gen eration. Microalgae also have a very limited life of harvest and an incipient biomass that accelerates the expected biomass to a higher productivity. Furthermore microalgae are the only components for biofuel conversion that have a tremendous amount of carbohydrates protein and lipid 8 . Owing to all these potentials the global market for algal biofuel was estimated as 5.022 billion USD in 2020 and it is anticipated to reach 9.033 billion USD in 2027 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR of 8.75 Despite this significant market value there are many research avenues need to be technically addressed to adopt complete transition of fossil-based fuels to alternate and sustainable microalgal biofuel. Hence the pre sent review is intended to critically analyze the possible research gaps in the current microalgal research by providing comprehensive informa tion on the various production strategies and bioconversion technolo gies. For the benefit of the readers significant findings of the present review are reported here. Contrary to the microbial biomasses such as bacteria and fungi the growth and maintenance of algal cultures are not so simple for the bulk manufacturers and hence the presence of skilled labors at each stages of algal growth is inevitable. Besides the studies on the isolation of optimal strain s or consortium nutrient supply and the extent of substrate utilization are the key areas to be extensively studied. Further the analysis on the metabolic load and flux distribution are the significant research hotspots for the prospective research in the biofuel production. 2. Algae and biofuels The production of microalgae and biofuel can be carried out in two main stages that include upstream and downstream processes. Various cultivation methods are included in the upstream phase to achieve maximal biomass while the downstream phase focuses on harvest technology and sustainable biofuel production 5 . Increased biofuel production from a variety of algal strains necessitates ambient cultiva tion methods that lead to creative solutions after thorough algal research. These environmentally friendly strategies promote the use of domestic industrial and agricultural wastewater for algal cultivation in order to achieve the dual goal of wastewater remediation and biofuel production resulting in a multifaceted ecologically friendly strategy 9 10 . In general microalgae can be grown using four different methods of cultivation including phototrophic heterotrophic mixotrophic and photoheterotrophic as shown in Fig. 1. Autotrophic cultivation indicates growth by means of converting inorganic carbon to organic form with light. Heterotrophic cultivation requires organic carbon for growth in the absence of light. However in mixotrophic cultivation cells are grown by both autotrophic and heterotrophic mode depending on the food resources. Photoheterotrophic cultivation indicates growth in the presence of suitable light and organic carbon sources 11 . 2.1. Phototropic cultivation system Phototrophic microalgae can also be used as a carbon sink for the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Only phototrophic cultivation is financially feasible for large-scale biomass production of microalgae 12 . Microalgae can be grown in three different cultivation systems in the phototrophic method such as open ponds closed bio reactors and hybrid two stages 13 . Whereas open systems are economical and closed systems are better for nutrient removal hybrid systems represent the culmination of open and closed systems designed Fig. 1. Algal cultivation methods. A.B. Sathya et al. Fuel 332 2023 126199 3 exclusively for increased biomass production and wastewater remedia tion resulting in effective nutrient disposal 14 . Merits and demerits of different cultivation system have been illustrated in the Table 1. 2.1.1. Open pond cultivation system This is globally the most basic and oldest systems for producing microalgae on a large scale. Since 1950s this open cultivation tech niques have been used 15 . These open pond systems are universally used due to their ability to mitigate atmospheric CO2 and are shallow in nature 7 . They are also less expensive and most frequently used open systems are raceway pond circular pond tank shallow big pond and closed ponds. The location of open pond is extremely important taking into account the amount of sunlight available and the demands of the algae to be cultivated. They are also typically fitted with a rotating arm to ensure that the culture is constantly stirred 6 . Contamination of these systems by bacteria and maybe other microalgae is a real concern and sedimentation of biomass is avoided. Poor light permeation un controlled temperature loss due to evaporation and CO2 diffusion into the atmosphere are all potential downsides 16 . To minimize the risk of toxicity in the open cultivation aerators or fountains can be used to add water movement and pond aeration pet waste a typical source of extra nutrients and germs should be collected and disposed of and install rain barrels all throughout the neighborhood to cut down on polluting runoff. 2.1.2. Closed cultivation system The closed systems have been introduced to reduce open ponds constraints by stabilizing culture conditions. The photobioreactors PBRs have been designed to maximize the ease of access of light to achieve the optimum algal biomass. Moreover the PBRs can be mixed evenly so that the light can be optimally achieved to enhance cell growth and exchange of gas 17 . It can be assembled as bags tanks or towers of plastic or glass. Photo bioreactors are available in various designs such as flat tubular or columns the most widely accepted being tubular ones 18 . The tubular reactor consists of tubes horizontally or vertically positioned in several arrays. The tube is made of rubber polyethylene glass acrylic transparent silicone or plastic. Advanced technologies for designing such PBRs have been investigated to ensure a thin layer of biomass suspension free from contamination with ideal light and reduced energy requirements 19 . The flat panel PBR reactor consists of a flat transparent glass vessel polyethylene foil plexiglass or poly carbonate 20 . In contrast with tubular bioreactors they provide a high specific surface area proportion. Extremely high oxygen content can adversely affect algal growth the oxygen generated from photosynthesis is removed using an auxiliary tank. Closed PBRs must be intended to increase the surface volume ratio for improved algal growth to ensure the availability of solar radiation across a wider photosynthetic surface area. The main downside of these controlled reactors is their expense while contamination is completely removed 21 . Additional complex ities include excessive heat oxygen accumulation scaling difficulty and bio-floating and cell damage. 2.1.3. Hybrid cultivation system The hybrid systems are particularly created such that they are a combination of both types of cultivation systems Open and Closed . They are cost-effective and are intended for large-scale algae cultiva tion. 22 . Hybrid systems achieve high nutrient removal while pro ducing high biomass. The hybrid systems are low-cost which is used for large-scale cultivation. These systems address the shortcomings of open systems as well as the relatively high expenses of closed systems. In this scenario algae will be cultivated initially in a PBR to deliver maximum inoculants before being transferred to an open system allowing for maximal biomass production 23 . When algae become prominent and effectively compete with other microorganisms in open systems the likelihood of contamination in open systems is greatly reduced. 3. Biofuels derived from microalgae Global warming and biofuel depletion have prompted the globe to investigate the generation of bioenergy from algal biomass. Currently the only alternative accessible to replace consumption and dependency on fossil fuels is the development of biofuels from algal biomass. Microalgal biomass may be used to create a variety of biofuels such as biodiesel biogas bioethanol biohydrogen etc. 3.1. Biodiesel The most used energy sources are crude oil gas and coal but they are limited so there should be an alternative that satisfies the needs. The scarcity of these sources is caused because they are not abundant so an alternative source is required. Biodiesel is one serious contender where it s available unless there is a draught for vegetable and animal oils. The animal fats like tallow fatty acid and vegetable oil like soybean oil palm oil castor oil are some of the major feedstock of biodiesel 24 . These oils are converted into biodiesel by the transesterification process. These emit fewer amounts of toxic gases like carbon monoxide partic ulate matter and they do not emit sulfur. This is due to free oxygen present in the chain and it causes complete combustion which results in less emission of gases compared to the traditional fuels. Alternative energy source helps in retaining the conventional energy sources. Ac cording to International Energy Outlook 2016 projected the utilization of energy sources go up to 48 between 2012 and 2040 25 . 3.1.1. Basics and definition The word diesel was used primarily by G. Chavanne. Rudolf Diesel invented an iron cylinder with a flywheel in its base that has its fuel 26 . The model ran on nothing but peanut oil in remembrance of this incident 10th August as international biodiesel day. Biodiesel is initially derived only from peanut and then it is found that it can be derived from vegetable and animal fats. Biodiesels were produced by the Table 1 Merits and demerits of different cultivation type for the growth of microalgae. Cultivation type Merits Demerits Reference Open Affordability Ease of operation and maintenance Lesser energy usage Scalability is simple Evaporative cooling Contamination risk is high Vast land area is required Lower biomass yields Constraints in light transmittance if thick layer is utilized 11 86 Closed Cultivation parameters are well-controlled Increased algal productivity Decreased chance of contamination Economic in nature Consistent growing environment Hydrodynamic stress is minimal Anchorage-dependent growth Difficult scaling-up Most instances necessitate cooling Hybrid Reduced contamination Decreased usage of energy Improved algal production Prone to contamination Influenced by external factors A.B. Sathya et al. Fuel 332 2023 126199 4 transesterification process. In this process glyceride reacts with alcohol in presence of a catalyst to form an ester of fatty acids and alcohol. In the past people used vegetable oil as a fuel to run diesel engines which was replaced by petrol for efficiency as the usage of petrol is causing pollution to land water and air the alternative form of renewable diesel called biodiesel came into the picture. Since this diesel is made from organic components it is called Biodiesel which consists of mono alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids and meets the requirement of American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM D 6751 27 . This type of fuel is eco- friendly efficient and can be used without modifying the engine if used up to certain blending limits Deepanraj et al. 2016 . 3.1.2. Fuel properties Generally the most cost-effective way of manufacturing the bio- diesel is through base-catalyzed transesterification as it requires low temperature and low pressure and ultimately creates a 98 yield. The reaction of triglyceride i.e. fat or oil with an alcohol to produce esters and glycerol is involved in the transesterification process. The glycerine particle with a base of three long-chain fatty acids forms the triglyceride. The properties of the fats are decided by the characteristics of the fatty acids connected with glycerine 28 . The qualities of biodiesel can be influenced by the nature of fatty acids. In the presence of a catalyst normally sodium hydroxide NaOH during the esterification process the triglyceride is made to react with alcohol 29 . The mono-alkyl ester or biodiesel and crude glycerol are produced when alcohol reacts with fatty acids. Commonly the alcohol used is methanol and ethanol Methanol produces methyl esters and ethanol produces ethyl esters and is base-catalyzed by one or the other potassium or sodium hydroxide . The reaction between oil fats and alcohol establishes a reversible re action thus the alcohol should be added in abundance to establish an entire conversion. If the ester and the glycerol layers are separated after the reaction then only the transesterification reaction is successful. The heavier co-items i.e. glycerol settles out and is sold for what it s worth for example the drug beauty care products and so forth. Table 2 ex hibits the Biodiesel yield on different types of microalgae with different feedstock. 3.1.3. Environmental and health impacts Biodiesel is commonly used all around the globe as transportation fuel due to its bio renewable fluid properties. The ecological advantages that biodiesel provides has made it more appealing. it provides more energy which can be used with respect to its counterpart fossil energy lessens ozone harming substances lessens a few significant air poisons and negligibly affects human and ecological wellbeing through N P furthermore pesticide discharge 30 . It is very less polluting when compared with petrol and diesel fuels because of which emissions of pollutant such as SO2 sulfur dioxide unburned hydrocarbons CO2 carbon dioxide air toxics CO carbon monoxide and particulates are very less 31 . 3.2. Biogas Biogas is a renewable gas produced by the breakdown of natural count such as food scraps and animal waste 32 . It s far an herbal gas that is acquired via anaerobic digestion i.e. bacterial fermentation that takes area within the absence of oxygen of natural residue from plant or animal residues. Denitrifying microorganism which converts the nitrates within the soil to unfastened nitrogen i.e. Methanogens is utilized in global gas plant. Approximately 50 70 of biogas is made from methane and the final of carbon dioxide and different as minor factor 33 . As biogas is a renewable in addition to an easy supply of energy biogas plant life notably are the greenhouse impact the plant lowers the methane emission with the aid of capturing the dangerous gas and the usage of it as fuel. 3.2.1. Basics and definition Biogas production is a biotechnology that has a very long tradition for some 2 000 3 000 years. Biogas was applied at first for sanitation purposes and further for energy production 34 . Biogas plays a salient role in transformation to an economy low in carbon. Biogas can be considered as one of the potential alternative energy sources available today. We can assume that the modern biogas production industry is just at the leap of wider implementation. Factors that affect low establish ment of biogas include but not limited to unawareness about the pos sibilities of biogas untrained labor force high capital cost and no subsidies and lack of legislative government policies. The biogas consists of methane CH4 CO2 oxygen O2 water H2O hydrogen sulphide H2S and sulphur S traces. Biogas is enhanced to biomethane 98 CH4 in a biogas treatment plant which has properties close to natural gas and can be utilized for all natural gas applications 35 . Thus refined biogas and biomethane obtained from raw biogas are renewable sources of fuels which can be reserved for future use. Gas produced released by the anaerobic organic matter digestion biomass gasification or power into gas from sources of biomass and without subsequent purification or upgrading As per source ISO 20675 2018 36 . Biogas comprises of methane carbon dioxide carbon monoxide hydrogen and heavier hydrocarbons with 2 to 6 carbon atoms As per source ISO 20675 2018 . Biomass can be divided into the following categories namely substrate of farm origin e.g livestock waste Landfill Gas municipalities waste and private household s waste and industrial by-products glycerine . Table 3 reveals the various microalgae with different feedstock used for the production of biogas. 3.2.2. Fuel properties Biogas is another effective gaseous biofuel produced from a variety of natural and waste sources. It contains CH4 and CO2 with low amounts of hydrogen H2 nitrogen N2 hydrogen sulphide H2S oxygen O2 water H2O and saturated hydrocarbons i.e ethane propane 35 . CH4 can be burned much cleaner than coal providing energy with moderate levels of CO2 emissions. Biomethane eliminates fuel-related pollution. It also reduces the risk of potentially destructive accidents 37 . 3.2.3. Environmental and health impacts Biogas is renewable and sustainable as it can enhance energy secu rity. It permits exploitation of agricultural and organic byproducts with a lesser effect on the standard of air in contrast to the use of conventional fuels. It is a good alternative than those whose emissions that leads to eutrophication and acidification. Organic material if not used becomes harmful and pathogenic. Using methane as an energy source reduces its climatic effect by forming CO2 which is comparatively less harmful as a greenhouse gas. Biogas can significantly reduce the impacts of emissions by greenhouse gas but caution must be paid towards unwanted emis sions of CH4 and nitrous oxide N2O 38 . Methane has higher impacts on the environment compared to CO2. The presence of hydrogen sul phide poses various health risks due to its toxicity and the negative pressure causes explosion of biogas. 3.3. Biosyngas Biosyngas is a semi solid cluster that is produced after digesting the organic waste and producing bio methane. This cluster usually contains plastics and heavy metals which help in the reduction of utilization. Also as it is available in surplus amount it becomes more of an expenditure which in turn causes problems to agriculture field. The main objective of this is to overcome the challenges by thermally treating this cluster and producing a variety of byproducts that will help improving the nutrients that exists in wastes. By adding the thermal treatment with existing biogas plant it increases bio methane produc tion and overall efficiency. Another advantage by adding a thermal treatment is that it broadens the sort of organic wastes that would be treated in biogas plants and thus it increases biogas production. A.B. Sathya et al.

It may be used as raw material for biofuel production and chemical production further reducing the CO2 emissions and consumptions of fossil fuels. During the initial years of research efforts were made for liquid fuels production from biomass. Initially all the experimentation was aimed at production of product gas through gasification of biomass 39 . During the course of research biomass gasification developments were being made and later new insights were found related to scale and layouts of optimum biomass plants. It was found that biomass being an expensive fuel production processes should be in a way that there is maximum biomass to produce efficiency in order to ensure cost effective production. 3.3.2. Fuel properties Biosyngas can be obtained by high temperature gasification of biomass. Upon gasification of biomass for higher temperatures greater than 1200 c biomass is almost completely converted to bio syngas 40 . Components of the biosyngas produced mainly include CO CH4 and H2. It might contain traces of other elements like N2 CO2 and high-order hydrocarbons. Chemical composition of bio syngas is similar to syngas derived from fossil sources. Biosyngas is also used as feedstock for thermochemical processes like for the production of biofuels like methanol ethanol dimethylether DME and gases such as hydrogen and synthetic natural gas SNG 41 . Combustion properties of bio syngas are dependent on the composition of the gas. It is observed from experiments that increase in fraction of H2 increases the explosion pressure and decrease in explosion time. In order to reduce the explosion pressure and increase explosion time N2 CO2 is added.Treated gas is used accordingly for the purposes like storage transportation. Table 4 shows the observation of employment of various microalgae for bio syngas production. 3.3.3. Environmental and health impacts Biosyngas is a conversion of problematic wastes to useful fuels majorly it reduces carbon emission and that is the basic purpose to modify fuels to save the environment. All the conventional fuels impose a bad impact on the environment to reduce this harmful effect many Table 3 Various microalgae with different feedstock used for the production of biogas. S.

Fuel 332 2023 126199 7 measures are into action now. Production of syngas is one among them. The composition in syngas mostly tar and humidity are major sub stances to utilize the synthesis gas. Alternative disposal of problem gas is syngas. Syngas can be harnessed as an energy source and thus it is the best substitute to conventional fuels. One of the key purposes to produce biosyngas is to eradicate carbon emission and its harmful effects on human health. Therefore we can say there are no such health issues caused due to it. 3.4. Bioethanol Ethanol is a hydrocarbon with chemical structure C2H5OH. The hy droxide group present in the ethanol makes it a polar molecule. Bio ethanol is a biofuel that is generally produced by fermenting sugarcane and grains and other agricultural waste like wheat straw etc. Even algae grown in wastewater sewage or salt water can be used to produce bioethanol. Bioethanol can either be directly used as fuel or as an addition with gasoline. It has a greater octane number which helps in enhancing performance and efficiency in internal combustion engines. It can be used as feedstock for use in chemical industry and as fuel in thermal power plant. 3.4.1. Basics and definition Bioethanol also known as biomass-based ethanol is primarily pro duced by the fermenting sugar glucose and sucrose mainly obtained from organic sources like plants sugarcane corn maize wheat and many more using cultured microorganisms yeasts 42 . It is a transparent colorless liquid. It has many perks like biodegradability less toxicity less harm to the environment than other traditional fuels. Brazil and U.S.A were major bioethanol producers from sugarcane and corns respectively by the 1970s. Currently the production focus is mostly on lignocellulosic biomass. Bioethanol is most commonly used as automobile fuel. It is blended with petrol at certain ratios at any concentration up to pure ethanol E100 . In 2009 the Government of India adopted a nationwide policy on biofuels with a target of ethanol blending with petrol in a phased manner by 2005 2010 and 2017 5 10 and 20 respectively . But the target was not met by 2017 and the achievement date was extended to 2030. Table 5 illustrates the employment of various microalgae with different feedstock for the bioethanol production. 3.4.2. Commercial benefits Bioethanol blended fuel has a considerable advantage over conven tional fuels which are i. It is a renewable source of energy as it comes from crops that can be grown infinitely as long as all the nutritional and weather conditions are met. ii. It will limit to a level the greenhouse emission as the fuel crops will absorb the carbon dioxide emission. It will also improve the rural economy where the fuel crop is grown. iii. It is self-degradable and cleaner in nature than petroleum-based fuels. Also the carbon dioxide emission rate will be reduced if bioethanol-blend in older motor vehicle engines thus improving the air quality. iv. Since bioethanol is produced similarly to fermentation hence it can be distributed using similar transportation vehicles and methods. 3.5. Biohydrogen Bioenergy promises a common and non-polluting source of energy. Table 4 Observations of employment of various microalgae for biosyngas production. S.

Fuel 332 2023 126199 8 One of the biggest benefits of using gasoline is a water-fired product than CO or CO2. Bioenergy includes biodiesel biogas biohydrogen bio ethanol and biosyngas 43 . Hydrogen is receiving a lot of attention because of its clean and non-reactive feature. Hydrogen can be produced by biological channels through biological imagery black fermentation and thermochemical and enzymatic. Currently only 5 of total Hydrogen is produced from biological resources and the remainder is produced from conventional sources such as coal oil and natural gas. Providing industrial users with hydrogen is big business 44 . At pre sent many countries are trying to increase the number of sectors that use hydrogen. 3.5.1. Basics and definition In the late 16th century the scientist named Robert Boyle had first artificially produced the hydrogen through a reaction between iron and acid and Henry Cavendish recognized it as the flammable air or Water former . In 1783 Antoine Lavoisier gave the element name hydrogen in Greek which means water creator. In the year 1939 Hans Gaffron noticed the algae named Chlamdomonas reinhardtii grown in the pond scum would occasionally change from the producing oxygen to hydrogen which is known as biohydrogen. However worldwide the production of hydrogen is carried out by the energy intensive electrol ysis process and derived from 48 from natural gas 18 from coal and 30 from the oil. Hydrogen production form the fossil fuels gives us the greenhouse gas such as carbon dioxide and etc. Biohydrogen is a clean and sans carbon fuel. Biohydrogen is char acterized as hydrogen delivered naturally most regularly by green growth algae microorganisms and archaea from both development and from squander natural materials. Most naturally created hydrogen in the biosphere is developed in microbial maturation measures. These organic entities break down naturally into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Bio hydrogen is accepted to be one of the biofuels of things to come conceivably consolidating the capacity to decrease reliance of petroleum products and lower ozone harming substance emanations from the Table 5 Employment of various microalgae with different feedstock for the bioethanol production.

The future job of hydrogen as a spotless fuel for power modules creating close to zero emanations and as a middle of the road energy transporter for capacity and transport of sustainable power is progressively perceived around the world. Bio hydrogen can possibly dispose of the greater part of the issues that pe troleum derivatives make if not all. 3.5.2. Fuel properties Biohydrogen is composed of a mixture of hydrogen and methane where the hydrogen concentration can range from 10 to 30 45 . The molecular mass of bio hydrogen is 21.06 the density is 300 kg m3 the laminar flame speed is 2.9 m s the specific gravity is 3.185 and the self-ignition temperature is 858 C. The gasification method is used to increase hydrogen content. In this process methane and steam react to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Production of bio hydrogen follows biological routes like dark fermentation thermochemical and enzymatic processes. The production of bio hydrogen is primarily dependent on microbes and bio catalysts both of which are hydrogen metalloenzymes also known as hydrogenase. In all the bio fuels which alternative to the conventional fuels like the syngas natural gas etc. Hydrogen has the distinct advantages like a renewable does not emit the carbon based gases liberates the large amount of energy per unit weight on combustion and can be converted into electricity by fuel cell 46 . Biological hydrogen has the clean hydrogen which does not involve the fossil fuel which is a sustainable manner with simple technology had the potential then current tech nology present globally where the future of the hydrogen depends on the sustainability on the society environmental and economy. Table 6 demonstrates the different microalgae with different feedstock employed for biohydrogen production. 4. Biomass conversion technologies According to current research and development algal biomass-based third generation biofuels which avoid many of the drawbacks of first and second generation biofuels are the best alternative to petroleum- based fuels 47 . Algae may be used to make a variety of sustainable biofuels including ethanol biodiesel biogas and photo-biologically generated biohydrogen 48 . There are several forms of microalgae biomass conversion technology including direct combustion chemical reaction thermochemical conversion and biochemical conversion.

Sathya et al. Fuel 332 2023 126199 10 via fermentation . Despite biochemical methods are more ecologically friendly and require less energy they aren t really appropriate for large- scale manufacturing due to their poor conversion efficiency time- consuming reaction steps and inability to be cost-effective. Gasifica tion liquefaction and torrefaction are thermochemical processes that transform biomass into biofuels such as biochar biogas syngas and hydrocarbon fuel. Different type of biofuel produced from various microalgae has been listed in Table 7. 4.1. Thermochemical conversion Biomass is converted to biofuel through a process known as ther mochemical conversion in which thermal decomposition is the primary chemical reaction. Gasification liquefaction and pyrolysis are three thermochemical processes involved in conversion of biomass. Gasifica tion occurs as a result of partial oxidation of wet biomass which gen erates a low-heating value combustion gas that can be burned directly. Catalyst is present at higher temperatures 800 1000 C for these re actions. There are several studies on the gasification characteristics of microbial biomass which include the presence of CO2 and H2 as major products and traces of CO2 N2 and methane as minor products. Using microbial biomass Spirulina Hirano et al in 1998 49 reached the maximum theoretical yield of 64.0 methanol per gram of dry biomass by partially oxidizing it at the temperature of 1000 C. Despite this one of the biggest challenges in gasification is preventing tar from forming in the gasified products because this fouls pipes filters turbines and gas engines. There have been technological advances towards minimizing tar formation including iterating the gasifier design tuning the oper ating conditions gasifying agent pressure temperature steam biomass ratio etc. and applying effective catalysts. Using Aspen Plus a new gasification model from the UK has recently been developed that pro duces syngas and CO2 with the lowest tar content but preliminary experimentation has not been performed yet to verify this model 50 . The thermochemical process of liquefaction is remarkably similar to that of gasification. The liquefaction processes occur at a considerably lower temperature one-third of the temperature required for gasifica tion but they necessitate a high partial pressure of H2 5 20 MPa . The liquefaction response frameworks and the cycle activity are normally perplexing consequently making them costly. Converting heavy hy drocarbons into light hydrocarbons is the main goal. The primary concept is to use a high water activity to transform the heavy hydro carbon chain into less complex molecules with a greater energy density. Research by Minowa et al. investigated employed wet biomass Duna liella tertiolecta as raw material in the thermos-liquefaction apparatus. At 300 C a whole liquid oil production of 42 per dry biomass was achieved with a reported higher heating value of 354.9 MJ kg. Due to the obvious growing demand for liquid fuel liquefaction method offers the potential to economically replace petroleum-based liquid oil. Fig. 2. Methods of microalgae biomass transformation into biofuel and its products. A.B. Sathya et al. Fuel 332 2023 126199 11 Moreover the pyrolysis fuel presents technical problems such as higher viscosity increased acidity dissolved compounds and higher moisture content. As a result an upstream oil upgrading system is necessary for the liquid oil purification process Demirbas A et al. 2007 . Torre faction is a thermochemical conversion process that uses biomass to create coal fuel biochar . This process produces solid coal fuel as its primary output while liquids and gases are generated as byproducts 51 . Biochar is rich carbon containing biomass that may be generated by the thermal composition of organic feedstock in absence of oxygen 52 . Pyrolysis biochar has a high surface area making it more suited for soil fertility enhancement and waste treatment but in comparison to torrefaction the colorific value is limited for pyrolysis biochar. Torre faction can thus provide higher-quality solid fuel than pyrolysis 53 . 4.2. Chemical conversion Depending on the feed composition chemical conversion of algal lipid oil is generally accomplished by esterification or trans esterification. Lipids microalgae oil are the basic material for chemical conversion. They are composed mostly of triglycerides 90 98 moisture and traces of other leftover components. To avoid saponifi cation the esterification process comes before the transesterification reaction if the lipids include a lot of free fatty acids or moisture. Transesterification of biodiesel includes the interaction of lipids of microalgae triglycerides free fatty acids through monoalcohols in the presence of a catalyst 54 . The transesterification process is classified into three kinds depending on the nature of catalyst used such as en zymes acid and base transesterification. These types were additionally partitioned into two broad classes homogeneous and heterogeneous transesterification as displayed in Fig. 3. Because of the inexpensive price of the catalyst and the quick reaction rate homogeneous trans esterification processes are favored. In contrast the separation and regeneration of the used catalyst is considerably easier in heterogeneous transesterification processes allowing it to be employed on a wider scale 55 . Owing to the benefits like simple product separation no saponi fication and operation at considerably lower temperatures the enzy matic transesterification process is a popular research subject nevertheless commercialization requires optimization of the Table 7 List of algal species in the production of different forms of biofuels.

Biodiesel production through transesterification processes. A.B. Sathya et al. Fuel 332 2023 126199 12 operational conditions 56 . Due to the cheap cost of separation and the ease of catalyst pro duction heterogeneous basic transesterification is environmentally benign and can thus be simply scaled up. The homogeneous trans esterification reaction employs KOH and NaOH which are the two most often utilized bases in the commercial manufacture of biodiesel 2 57 61 . For instance homogenous methyl alcohol and sodium hy droxide achieves 85 fatty acid methyl esters FAME during process ing of waste oil into biodiesel 62 . Despite of inexpensiveness of homogeneous basic catalysts for optimal FAME production it necessi tates a larger mono-alcohol oil ratio. Most commonly employed alcohol is methanol in transesterification processes however in some cases ethanol and butanol are also used. Heterogeneous base catalysts are far more significant in industry than those aided by homogeneous catalysts during transesterification processes 2 . This may be due to the fact that solid heterogeneous base catalysts can easily be separated from liquid effluent and this doesn t form emulsion and corrosion. Acidic trans esterification reaction doesn t form soap when compared to basic transesterification since esterification and transesterification occurs simultaneously. In homogenous acid catalyzed esterification of micro bial oil H2SO4 sulphuric acid and HCl hydrochloric acid are the two almost always employed catalyst. Soriano et al. investigated the ho mogeneous transesterification of vegetable oil into biodiesel using both AlCl3 and ZnCl2 acids. 98 yield of FAME was recorded at 110 C for 18 h using AlCl3 as a catalyst. AlCl3 has a better catalytic performance than ZnCl2 as a result of its higher acidity 63 64 . Transesterification of microbial oil into biodiesel using lipases enzyme is developing as a very cost-effective and ecologically friendly technique capable of overcoming the potential issues related to basic and acidic transesterification. High-purity biodiesel production no saponification minimal operating costs simple separation and recycling are all appealing benefits of enzyme-assisted transesterification pro cesses. As a result biodiesel synthesis by enzyme-catalyzed trans esterification is the greatest long-term alternative to petro-diesel 65 . Lipases are commonly employed in both free form homogeneous transesterification and immobilised form heterogeneous trans esterification . The free form or homogeneous condition allows for better mixing and therefore increased contact duration with the catalyst resulting in higher activity especially contrasted to the immobilized arrangement. The inclusion of alcohols like methanol ethanol and butanol during enzyme transesterification is common. The presence of these alcohols has been shown to decrease enzyme activities by inacti vation or denaturation. In a study using lipase obtained from Pseudo monas cepacia for enzyme-catalyzed transesterification resulted only in 54 of FAME yield due to the inclusion of alcohol 66 . Perhaps the alcohol should be added in phases or a co-solvent such as tert-butanol or n-hexane should be employed 67 . The inclusion of such co-solvents in the generated biodiesel on the other hand enhances the separation cost which increases the biodiesel cost. In order to improve yield to 100 and to avoid enzyme denaturation long chain alcohols such as propanol and butanol could be effectively used rather than methanol and ethanol 68 . 4.3. Biochemical conversion Organic substances Sucrose cellulose bagasse and starch are converted to bioethanol through metabolic activity of microbial sources by fermentation mechanism. Depending on the requirement of oxygen fermentation can be divided in to two categories namely aerobic and anaerobic fermentation. Microalgae rich in carbohydrate content are appropriate for fermentation to generate bioethanol. On the other hand the majority of species of microalgae exhibit relatively low carbohy drates. In such cases the conditions of the microalgal cultivation like light sources and nutrient supply may be altered to change the biomass composition. Yeast converts sugars derived from carbohydrates found in algal biomass such as laminarin alginate agar sulfated polysaccharides and mannitol into ethanol. The yield of bioethanol generated from microalgae is 2 5 times that of ethanol formed from sugarcane and corn. A 65 ethanol conversion could be achieved by C. vulgaris an attractive microalgae species since it has a high starch content of about 37 . Other strains such as Spirulina Dunaliella Sce nedesmus and Chlamydomonas are also recorded as promising bio ethanol producer as they have more than 50 starch content. There are different types of algae such as red brown and green algae are all investigated for bioethanol production through fermentation processes. Brown algae are regarded as the major feedstock among microalgae varieties due to its higher carbohydrate content and simplicity of mass cultivation. Bioethanol is a marketable and widely utilized trans portation fuel. According to statistics in 2008 86 of automobiles sold in Brazil used fuel with ethanol mixing. Nevertheless bioethanol seems to have some disadvantages such being corrosive having a poor energy value and having a low vapour pressure. Bioethanol is posed for inte gration with existing transportation fuel. However in order to obtain long-term advantages and sustainability additional efforts must be made to convert bioethanol to a superior quality fuel that may be used alone or in conjunction with fossil fuels 69 . Anaerobic digestion is the technique of digesting organic materials into biogas principally methane and carbon dioxide under anaerobic condition or with the assistance of hydrogen. The biogas generated seems to have a calorific value of 20 to 40 of the feedstock s lower heating value 70 . The organic waste containing high moisture level of about 80 90 is frequently employed for anaerobic digestion pro cesses. As a result the anaerobic digestion process an environmentally friendly route becomes suitable for the conversion of wet microalgae biomass in to renewable energy for home and industrial use. Methane gas is produced during the anaerobic digestion of organic materials by removing the carbon and nitrogen components from lipids of microalgae biomass. The microalgae s carbohydrate lipid and protein composition will have a direct impact on the anaerobic digestion process. When compared to carbohydrates or protein lipids from microalgae biomass can create more biogas 51 . Microalgae Ulva lactuca can create 271 m3 of methane per tonne of organic materials 52 . The process of producing hydrogen gas from microorganisms is known as biohydrogen generation. Photosynthesis is a type of biological electrolysis wherein water molecules are divided into a proton H and an oxygen molecule O2 . When hydrogen reacts with carbon dioxide in a typical photosynthesis route carbohydrate and oxygen are produced. In some cases of micro algal species rather than converting to glucose during photosynthesis hydrogen is generated under anaerobic condi tion. Hydrogenase enzyme may be used to generate hydrogen by a va riety of microalgae species including Tetraspora Chlorella Scenedesmus Chlamydomonas and others. The generation of biohydrogen can take place in three methods namely direct biophotolysis indirect bio photolysis and fermentation. In direct biophotolysis the hydrogen is produced from the electrons and protons released by water splitting at the photosystem whereas in indirect biophotolysis the breakdown of internal carbon molecules generates electrons and protons. On the other hand end result of fermentation is H2 formation when electrons pro duced from cellular endogeneous substate oxidation that reacts with H+ 69 70 . 5. Metabolic engineering of microalgae for the biofuel production In order to produce several kinds of biofuels such as bioethanol biodiesel and biohydrogen by utilizing carbon dioxide and sunshine microalgae are regarded as potential cell factories. Despite the distinc tive benefits of these microorganisms poor economic characteristics have made it difficult to commercialize microalgal biofuels. One of the most promising approaches to deal with this problem is metabolic en gineering 71 . Metabolic engineering is the strategy of optimizing the biochemical and regulatory pathways of the microbial cell system at the A.B. Sathya et al. Fuel 332 2023 126199 13 nuclear level to up-regulate or down-regulate the product of concern. These biochemical pathways are mediated by the vast range of enzymes and regulator molecules etc. and with the effective communication of these signaling molecules the pathways are maintained in the cell 72 . One dimension of looking into the metabolic engineering is trans formation of this series of events into a numerical expression which would be termed as model expressions to predict and understand the metabolic process of the product of concern more effectively. The other view key concept of metabolic engineering is to exploit the intracellular pathways with the recombinant tools such as gene overexpression gene knock out and heterologous expression etc. Fig. 4 illustrated an over view of various computational tools for metabolic engineering. With the great use of these tools and strategies the biodiesel production can be enhanced by suitably altering the cellular pathways of microalgae. For instance up-regulating the enzymes involved in the lipid biogenesis overexpressing the gene s responsible for coding the lipid biogenic enzymes identifying the potential rate-limiting reaction in the series of pathway to alter their kinetics increasing the light permeation rate or by decreasing the cell shading and performing flux balance analysis in vestigations such as metabolic control analysis MCA and metabolic flux analysis MFA . Typically the biogenesis of lipids in microalgal system involves three primary stages viz. Carboxylation Chain elonga tion and Triacylglycerol formation. To further interrogate into the feasibility of the approaches synthetic biology might help out the ways in which the pathways of the organism can be modified without affecting their survival rates. 73 investigated the metabolic fluxes of the each cellular compartment of C. reinhardtii by adopting a stoichio metric model with the expression include S the matrix component and v the vector components of flux. S.v 0 Online resources such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KEGG databases and MetaCyc databases might assist to trace the metabolic pathways of all organisms in all order of hierarchy. Also the differentially expressed genes can also be used to draw metabolic net works with the use of path Express tool 74 . Under N2 depriving conditions the differential gene expression pattern was evaluated for the pyruvate and acetyl-coA synthetic pathway with the aid of qPCR 75 . A gene knock down investigation by two micro RNAs targeting RBCS1 2 and MAA7 gene was reported in C. reinhardtii 76 . 77 has reported the fluxome studies in P. fluorescens in connection with the fructose metabolism Krebs cycle and Pentose phosphate pathway. Likewise reports can be seen in the model organism Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 in which the MFA was performed under photo-autotrophic conditions. Further the study has planned to localize the carbon distri bution in the cellular organelles using isotopically nonstationary 13 -C MFA INST-MFA with high degree of accuracy 78 79 . An over expression of CrDGTT4 type-2 diacylglycerol acyl-CoA acyltransferase gene in C. reinhardtii was accomplished to increase the accumulation of TAG under nutrient starvation conditions with the use of SQD2 sulfo quinovosyl diacylglycerol synthase 2 as promoter 80 . More recently few studies were reported with the possible use of advanced genetic tools such as multigene approaches reverse genetics clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR technology and Tran scription activator-like effector nucleases TALEN etc. in the process improvement and optimization. Despite the use of gene knock out through RNA interference RNAi was successful in C. reinhardtii 81 D. salina 82 it is highly complex to establish a common baseline sys tem for the other species of microalgae involved in the production of biodiesel. 6. Potential challenges in the microalgal research The exponential population growth across the globe and continuous depletion of fossil reserves were the prime reasons behind the search for new alternate and sustainable way of producing fuels to meet the needs of the society. In connection with this microalgae based biofuel pro duction has received prime attention in the past decades among the energy researchers to exploit their usage in the next generations. How ever there are certain potential challenges exist in this sustainable approach which has to be scientifically addressed prior to the commercialization of the process products. 6.1. Lack of comprehensive understanding of biochemical molecular and genetic profiling Despite the fact that several strains of microalgae were employed in the biodiesel production only limited numbers of strains were able to show the excellent potential in the accumulation of lipid in terms of its quality and quantity. In accordance with this only a very few number of microalgae strains considered as a potential candidate for the energy production in contrast to the total microbiota of more than 25 000 strains 83 . Also the specified species of microalgae oleaginous microalgae has the ability to accumulate lipids of more than 20 of its own biomass would also suffer with the following limitations. a Inad equate knowledge on the elucidation of its biochemical pathways and molecular fingerprinting b inability to develop an effective and rapid tools for the screening of different strains and c absence of complete genetic profiling and comprehensive understanding of metabolic path ways of the oleaginous strains. Fig. 4. Overview of computational tools for metabolic engineering. A.B. Sathya et al. Fuel 332 2023 126199 14 6.2. Growth and operational factors of the biofuel production in large- scale cultivations The open raceway ponds and closed photobioreactor PBR systems are the ideal systems for the massive cultivation of micro algal species. Of this each of the system was suffered with potential drawback. For instance monoculture maintenance of micro algal species is highly challenging in the open raceway ponds and also the existence of non- native strains might cause the risk of micro algal spills 84 . The po tential contamination with other strains grazers and bacteria etc. might lead to the complexity in maintaining the desired population of micro algal strains. Likewise the closed PBR systems are facing the over heating and fouling issues due to the improper exchange of gases across the system. Also the capital and operational cost would be more expensive than the former open method 85 . Also the optimization of the cultivation and operational variables needs further investigations to provide the functional insights about their dependency on the inde pendent variables. Furthermore scaling up of the process seems highly complex as there are high degrees of ambiguity exist in the redundancy and the reproducibility of the functional traits of the strains. 6.3. High capital operational cost and complex downstream recovery Besides the selection of strains and its productivity dewatering of biomass is the crucial stage of operation prior to the extraction of lipids and esterification. These algal pretreatment steps may be carried out with the process of energy-intensive drying and solvent extraction which significantly influences the overall economy of the process. Secondly the requirement of basal nutrients such as water carbon dioxide 3.5 kg to 9.3 kg nitrogen and phosphorous would also contribute significantly to the overall cost of the process. Further to reduce the free fatty acid FFA content enzyme-mediated lipase based or acidic treatment should be employed which would increase the cost of the process and also complicates the downstream recovery or separation process. 7. Prospective research 7.1. Feasible ways of cost minimization The prime concern of the current microalgal research in the biodiesel production is the high capital and operational cost than the conventional diesel production. In order to alleviate this the use of nutrient-rich organic wastewater can be used to fulfill the base elements re quirements such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Also studies can be envisioned in the context of 100 absolute nutrient recycling process which would greatly reduce the process cost. However with the use of such alternative organic resources like wastewater care must be taken to completely eliminate the bacterial and other microbial communities which might influence the growth kinetics of microalgae. A systematic and comprehensive life cycle impact assessment studies need to be carried to reveal their interaction with the ecosystem and to exploit the use of by-products in sustainable way. Integrated strategies may be employed to figure out the power required to operate the cultivation ponds for instance the heat liberated from the hydrothermal system can be channelized for the generation of power which would also reduce the burden of the overall economy of the process. In contrast to first- and second-generation biofuels some species of microalgae could perhaps thrive through harsh conditions such as optimum level to high pH temperature and salinity e.g. Dunaliella Spirulina Nannochloris Chlorella species and accumulate high levels of lipids tri-acyl glycer ides TAG with high annual oil productivities 40 times more oil per acre . Following the biooil nutrient-enriched microalgal biomass car bon nitrogen etc. could be transformed to commercial goods of rele vance for the welfare of both the market and environmental profit context. Further the practice of cultivation for biomass generation the harvesting and production of biomass and oil and the addition of value to the algal biomass using the biorefinery technique all affect the eco nomic feasibility of the algal biofuel industry. 7.2. Effective utilization of microalgae A comprehensive elucidation on the biochemical molecular and genetic traits of the different microalgal species would provide greater insights into their metabolic activities and hence their pathways can be engineered in accordance with the need of the society. Also the use of algal consortium may be attempted in open pond systems rather than the monoalgal culture and their lipid accumulation properties can be compared. Exploitation of genes in the nuclear level might create mutagenic and transgenic systems which would assist the enhanced accumulation of lipid levels. Besides the study may be focused on the generation of different metabolic models with appropriate process conditions for the optimization of cellular growth maintenance and energetics. 8. Conclusion Economic development and energy demand have become more rapid in recent years and a limited resource for fossil fuels resources and the need to protect the environment there is increasing concern over the development of eco-friendly fuels for instance biofuels will support resolve the issue. Biofuels derived from microalgae have been identified as a viable feedstock for the next generation of biofuels. Microalgae cultivation system becomes significant as it depends on the degree of control required for the desired product production and its value as well. Amongst available microalgae cultivation methods such as open pond closed PBR and hybrid system the hybrid system appears to be superior over others. The promising properties of microalgae entice the notion of constructing a sustainable biorefinery to reap multifarious advantages and strengthen the goals of a resource efficient bio-economy. This re view provides an extensive application of microalgae that have advan tageous characteristics which make them suitable as a replacement feedstock for a variety of bio-refinery applications. The enzyme cata lyzed transesterification has the highest long term ability to substitute fossil fuel derived products over other traditional biomass conversion technologies. Further researchers can produce required biomolecules using microbial genetic information that can be modified via metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. The application of metabolic engi neering and synthetic biology in biofuel production derived from microalgae is still in early stages. Therefore development of powerful genetic tool increased biomass and CO2 fixation are the challenges in present scenario which is needed to be resolved.

Conventional energy sources emit a huge amount of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere which creates energy and environmental challenges for the ecosystem. To fulfill the world energy demand and to support environmental as well as economic development in a sustainable way with the utilization of technological advancement of renewable energy resources algae are presently believed as most adaptable feedstock materials for bioenergy production. Algae has a high fixation rate of at mospheric carbon dioxide which supports to fast growth rate with high productivity per unit area in the form of renewable algal biomass. The present article aims to elaborate on the three generations of biofuels sustainable microalgae biomass production cultivation systems and a wide range of growth parameters. The microalgae harvesting methods and their challenges are also discussed with a special focus on lipid extraction methods and future r recommendations. The upstream and downstream processes of microalgae could help to harness the microalgae energy in an eco-friendly manner and will help in achieving overall sustainable development. 1. Introduction Recently with fluctuating oil prices researchers academicians and the commercial sector are focusing on energy alternatives to decrease the energy crisis as a whole. According to Coyle and Simmons 2014 the total global primary energy supply in 2010 was estimated as 12 700 Million tonnes of oil equivalent Mtoe which will increase up to one hundred percent in the year 2035. Highly developed nations have a high energy utilization rate compared to other developing nations Wang et al. 2020 . The quantum of conventional energy resource utilization is consummate in advanced countries such as Australia the USA and European Union EU despite austere environmental coercions that cause global warming via greenhouse gas GHGs emission. As a result of global warming hostile conditions such as temperature elevation and ocean acidification due to GHGs make humans existence on earth challenge. The main components of the GHGs are carbon dioxide CO2 oxides of sulfur SOx and nitrous oxide N2O etc. out of which CO2 is the highest contributor at present Singh et al. 2019 . The atmospheric CO2 magnitude has amplified from 280 ppm in 1750 to 415 ppm at present William and Craig 2020 . Therefore it is necessary to mitigate this prevailing energy dilemma sensibly using the copious resources of renewable energy like wind geothermal solar and biomass energy. However developing countries like India are mitigating climate change although it is earnestly dependent on conventional energy resources. Most of the power generation in India is carried out by fossil fuel-based power plants which produce a vast amount of GHGs. The per-capita energy utilization in India is approximately 0.55 kW which is lesser than that of developed nations 1 13th of USA 1 11th of Saudi Arabia and 1 9th of Japan Kober et al. 2020 . Biomass is considered a carbon-neutral source of energy. Being the Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses R. Kothari V.V. Tyagi .

A wide variety of energy necessities are abated through biomass energy like electricity generation vehicular fuel and process heat for industries. Biomass gets its distinctiveness amongst all the renewable energy forms. It commendably reserves solar energy and is the sole exclusive carbon renewable resource that could be easily transformed into a solid liquid or gaseous form of fuel by disparate transformation procedures. The biomass-based energy generated by the biochemical conversion includes biohydrogen biodiesel biogas and bioethanol which are the possible biofuels of the future generation. Among different renewable biomass energy sources algae as the third generation feed stock holds several key advantages over conventional feedstock for biofuel production biodiesel biogas biohydrogen etc. owing to its high energy content high growth rate capacity with CO2 fixation inexpensive media utilization etc. However the development of a cost-efficient microalgae cultivation system is still an issue in the large-scale commercial production of microalgae-derived biofuels. The upstream and downstream microalgae cultivation for biodiesel pro duction is important routes to manage the microalgae cultivation feasibility. Cultivation systems and growth parameters are upstream processes that are the main primary tools to produce a high amount of microalgal biomass. Harvestation methods and biomass conversion into biofuels are downstream processes that regulate biofuel lipid and value-added products production from harvested microalgal biomass. The aim of this article is focusing on upstream and downstream processes of microalgae. The first part of the article provides a wide knowledge about biofuel generations and an in-depth discussion has been provided on the potential of microalgae-based biofuels and different factors that affect the cultivation upstream and downstream processing of microalgae-based biofuels. Besides several key challenges affecting the commercial viability and applicability of algae-based bio fuels are identified and a future direction is provided to enhance biofuel production and their value-added products. 1.1. Competition between generations of biofuels Edible crops are the main source of first-generation biofuels. Various components starch sugar and edible oil of different edible crops such as corn wheat and sugarcane are used to produce biofuels. It is note worthy that as far as the generation is concerned there are no modifications in the structural configuration of the biofuels none the less change in the biofuel genesis is observed between generations. The first-generation biofuels pose both direct and indirect competition be tween crops for food and fuel. It also causes indirect competition for food crop production as it is responsible for the transfiguration of forests into agricultural land. Second-generation biofuels are said to be sustainable as they are derived from non-food biomass crops and these don t compete with arable land as shown in Fig. 1. Also zero fertilizer less water and negligible pesticide input are required for their production. Nevertheless the sustainability of these crops is being questioned because of the land-use changes that ensued for such crops growth. Commercial production of the second generation non-food crops such as jatropha is done on fertile land which gives direct competition to the land required for food production Ahmad et al. 2019a 2019b . While first and second-generation biofuels offer some advantages they suffer from the requirement of arable land water use and high-cost pre treatment. Therefore there is a need to find viable alternative energy resources to take care of economic environmental and social needs. Recently algae have emerged as an ideal third-generation biofuel feedstock that holds several advantages over first and second-generation feedstock. For instance algal biomass is possible to produce 15 300 times more biodiesel than the conventional crops on an area basis. In addition they have relatively short harvesting cycles 1 10 days for continuous mode and 10 15 days for batch mode Zabed et al. 2020 and can use wastewater as a nutrient media for their growth. Microalgal biomass could be produced in huge open ponds or through contrived closed compartments photobioreactors-PBR . The produced microalgal biomass can be subjected to drying and processing to produce bio ethanol or biodiesel. However identification of an appropriate species and operating conditions e.g. amount of sunlight water and nutrients are important as they help to accelerate growth rates Ahmad et al. 2020a 2020b 2020c . Palm produces 5950 L ha -yr of oil while Jatropha produces 1892 L ha yr but at the same time algae yields 12 000 L ha yr having 30 wt oil comparatively and volumetric productivity of algae is also high as given by some researchers in literature Adenle et al. 2013 . It is expected that 20.5 of arable land would require algae growth to meet the worldwide oil demand Nwoba et al. 2019 . This estimate could be reduced to zero if non-arable land is used for positioning the huge open ponds and closed PBR Kothari et al. 2019a 2019b . In the total global energy demand only 1.5 2.7 of the entire non-arable land would be Fig. 1. The deployment of different natural resources for the production of 1st 2nd and 3rd generation biofuels. S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 76 required by algae Trentacoste et al. 2015 . 2. Algae sustainable alternative biomass Algae are an assemblage of eukaryotic microorganisms whose ad herents have a unique attribute of oxygenic photosynthesis. Algal spe cies come in various sizes they could be micron µ sized single cell multicellular colonies or paradoxical of intricate spiny leafy structures. Surprisingly they could have a length of less than 2 mm picoplankton or 50 60 m giant kelp . Algae can be characterized either based on farm and texture Fritsch 1935 . Among different algae microalgae are the ones that have attracted the most attention for the biofuel industry. About 50 000 different microalgae species have been described and these can be divided as per the pigments resulting from their metabolism and their cell wall constituents. The most common classification is based on the cellular structure that classifies microalgae into six divisions or sections viz. 1 Pyrrophyta 2 Chlorophyta 3 Chrysophyte 4 Euglenophyta 5 Chlorophyta and 6 Rhodophyta. A detailed classi fication of microalgae is provided in Fig. 2. Microalgae species have varying chemical composition with no special organelles although this exceptional feature makes cultivation easier and controllable . The photosynthetic mechanism of microlgae is similar as to land plant but because of their simple cellular structure they have ample contact with water CO2 and other nutrients. Hence solar energy is more proficiently converted into biomass by the micro algae as opposed to the plants. Moreover compared to land-based plants microalgae produce more oil per acre to produce the same bio diesel quantity Fig. 3 . They don t require potable water and can grow in wastewater taking nutrients from it. 2.1. Microalgal cultivation system The commercial microalgae cultivation uses a special kind of bioreactor which provides optimum growth conditions for high pro ductivity. Open raceway ponds and closed photobioreactors are currently being used for microalgae cultivation Fig. 4 and their se lection depends on the specific needs. Open raceway ponds are commonly utilized for wastewater treatment whereas closed photo bioreactors are employed for pharmaceutical and value-added products. The closed photobioreactors show superiority over the open pond re actors. It requires nutrients like phosphorus iron nitrogen and occa sionally silicon for its growth So the growth medium should have an abundant amount of these inorganic elements. Many microalgae pre dominantly produce neutral lipids exclusively triacylglycerol and hy drocarbons the raw matter for biofuels under impelled environmental conditions. A variety of applications of microalgae prevail such as bio fuel production biodiesel biomethane biohydrogen CO2 mitigation manufacturing of nutrient supplements and nutraceuticals and waste water treatment Callegari et al. 2020 . Compared to terrestrial plants microalgae are more proficient in photosynthesizing and fixing CO2. For screening purposes an algal strain is firstly isolated then purified and subsequently grown under sterilized environments in the laboratory. An ideal strain should exhibit certain remarkable characteristics like high lipid content higher productivity a hasty growth rate and excess tri acylglycerols TAG fatty acid profile. It should also endure a broad range of temperature pH and salinity besides efficiently extract CO2 from effluent sources and contrive sustainable byproducts de Alva et al. 2018 . 2.1.1. Raceway pond The raceway pond has been the most frequently utilized open pond reactor system for large-scale microalgae cultivation and commercial output for the past 40 years. The most common algae species that can be cultivated in a raceway pond are Chlorella Spirulina Dunaliella and Haematococcus and the culture mode can be pure culture or wastewater with CO2 capture technology being utilized in some power plants Shekh et al. 2021 . A raceway pond can be built out of concrete or plastic and placed on the ground or dug into the earth and enclosed by a wall to keep fluids out of the soil. A raceway pond can be made with a single channel or multi-channels and depth of culture medium is generally between 15 and 50 cm with paddlewheel baffle which control liquid flow and keep the algal cells floating in the culture medium and avoid sedimentation. Baffles guide the movement of cells and keep them from settling in a dead zone. Algae cells are adequately mixed and maintained in a continuous flow in order to receive sunlight and CO2 from the environment. In a raceway pond biomass productivities reached 60 100 mg L-1 d-1 Kassim 2015 . Although the open pond reactor sys tem has shown to be the most cost-effective and long-term option for large-scale commercial microalgae production it still has faults that make it unsuitable for generating high-value-added microalgae products like fine compounds and natural pigments because contamination-free cultivation is still a great challenge with open pond reactor. Bacteria fungi and other algae species are the main contaminating agents that are identified by Assunç ao and Malcata 2020 . However open pond Fig. 2. Classifications of algae. S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 77 reactors continue to be the most popular kind of bioreactor for large-scale microalgae production especially outside the laboratory because of their low cost easy to operate and expandability. The world s biggest raceway pond which covers a massive 4 44 000 m2 is located in Calipatria USA and was designed and specialized for the mass production of spirulina-based goods. A number of wastewater sources can be utilized for algal cultivation depending on the nutrients required by algae species S. Ahmad et al. 2021 I. Ahmad et al. 2021 . The maintenance of light and temperature at the optimum range is a tedious task in open race pond reactors. With the exception of tropical areas the growing season varies considerably by region and is limited to the warmer months. Bad weather usually slows the growth of algae. Open ponds have several disadvantages including uneven light intensity evaporative losses CO2 penetration from the atmosphere and the requirement for large areas of land. Commercial algae production in open pond reactors has also been confined to species that can tolerate extreme conditions of contamination. Mass transfer rates are also poor in open culture techniques due to inadequate stirring mechanisms resulting in low biomass output shown in Table 1. Fig. 3. Biodiesel productivity of different crop plants and algae. Fig. 4. Cultivation of microalgae in open pond and photobioreactors. S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 78 2.1.2. Flat panel photobioreactor Flat panel photobioreactor FPBR is a rectangular box-shaped variation of traditional PBR that utilized for algae cultivation. It may be used indoors or outdoors depending on whether artificial light sources are employed. Glass plexiglass poly-carbonate and plastic bags are utilized to make FPBR which are transparent or semi-transparent. FPBR has sparked a lot of interest for producing photosynthetic micro organisms due to their large illumination surface area Suparmaniam et al. 2019 . Transparent materials are frequently used in FPBRs to maximize the use of solar light energy. As a result a light path that is sufficiently short generates a high light surface S V as well as effective light distribution penetration and utilization. In comparison to hori zontal tubular photobioreactors FPBRs accumulate dissolved oxygen concentrations more slowly Behera et al. 2019 . In contrast a flat form poses a high risk of photoinhibition especially in outdoor cultures or during the early stages of development diluted cultures . Light over saturation inhibits cells at high levels of irradiation causing significant damage to photosynthetic systems and cellular metabolism eventually leading to culture failure. It has been suggested that FPBRs can achieve high photosynthetic efficiency. FPBRs are suitable for large-scale algae cultivation. However as indicated in Table 1 they have some limits. FPBRs are often used to treat wastewater with low organic load low solid content and increased light transparency such as urban waste water residential wastewater and fish processing wastewater Sarker 2021 . There is also an example that is used to treat starch industrial wastewater. Hydraulic retention time HRT is a critical design param eter since high condensed growth microalgae have a self-shading effect that decreases biomass yield and nutrient uptake. However evaluating the bioreactor s photosynthetic impact using different microalgae strains is equally important. 2.1.3. Tubular photobioreactor Tubular photobioreactors TPBRs have the highest surface-to- volume ratio which benefits microalgae light exposure. TPBRs are built of transparent tubing glass or polyethylene with the most typical shape being a serpentine loop arranged in a single plan Hijazi et al. 2020 . The most frequent alternative for outdoor mass growing is the horizontally displayed patterns. Another distinguishing characteristic of tube reactors is their radial mixing efficiency. A traditional tubular PBR is shown in Fig. 1. Beyond the tubes a gas exchange system aids in the intake of fresh growth media the cycling of cooling water and the supply of CO2. TPBRs are distinguished from the other PBRs by their tube length and diameter flow velocity recirculation type and geo metric design of the light receiver Solimeno et al. 2017 . The tubes utilized are generally between 0.1 and 0.6 cm in diameter with lengths varying from a few hundred meters to thousands of meters photosyn thetic activity will largely limit tube length between liquid degassing locations. With dimensions of 0.1 cm or smaller productivity has been found to improve. TPBRs are referred to be solar collectors because microalgae migrate across a wide sun-light surface. The lens effect also known as the focusing effect ensures that incident light is equally dispersed since it is diffused around the perimeter and travels in a radial path concentrating on the tube s axis Assunç ao and Malcata 2020 . Mutual shadowing is decreased as a result of this process and radiation intensity can be raised. The high S V ratio of TPBR is particularly ad vantageous for effective light harvesting with minimal photo-inhibition. Due to the high land requirements and additional expenses involved with solar collector equipment like as degasser units medium pumps nutrient mixing reservoirs and CO2 delivery systems TPBRs cannot be extended forever such as carbonation towers . In TPBRs air-pump or airlift devices are often employed to aerate and mix the cultures. The advantages and disadvantages of TPBRs are shown in Table 1. Because of their wide lighting surface area TPBRs are ideal for outdoor bulk algal Table 1 Comparison of various types of reactors used to culture microalgae on a large scale.

On the other hand these PBRs have many faults one of which is inadequate mass transfer. Several studies have shown for example that in TPBRs extraordinarily large amounts of dissolved oxygen DO may be easily produced. In outdoor TPBRs photoinhibition is also fairly frequent. While the tube diameter can be increased and the tube length is needed to be maintained as low as feasible. Unless a suitable mixing mechanism is in place the cells in the lower section of the tube will not receive enough light for cell development due to the light shadowing effect . In any event by enhancing the mixing system in the tubes effective light distribution to the cells may be obtained Huang et al. 2017 . Furthermore most of the TPBR make it difficult to manage cul ture temperatures. Even if they have a thermostat maintaining the proper culture temperature can be expensive and time-consuming. Cell adhesion to the tube walls is common in tubular photobioreactors which should be noted. In long tubular photobioreactors oxygen and CO2 transfer gradients run the length of the tubes. 2.1.4. Vertical photobioreactor The construction of different varieties of vertical column PBRs is shown in Fig. 1. The top of the VPBR has a freeboard regime for gas liquid separation. Air bubbles rise higher in the air causing turbulence which aids in mixing Qin et al. 2019 . Perforate plates may be used inside the column depending on the design to break up bubbles and generate turbulence in a transparent column. An air sparger is used to supply air or CO2 at the bottom of internal column and degassing occurs at top of the internal column in the free board regime. Because the gas holdup within the internal column is much higher than the gas holdup in the degassed liquid outside of it the liquid gas combination flows up ward inside the internal column while the degassed liquid flows downward outside. The most evident advantage of VPBRs is better mixing which allows for adequate cell exposure to light radiation even when column width and cell density are large. It also has the advantage of being basic and easy to clean. A flat plate splits the column s diameter and divides the column into two parts the riser and the down comer regions in split column VPBRs. The liquid is carried upward by air pushed from the bottom of the riser zone Catrawedarma et al. 2021 . The heavy degassed liquid descends after the liquid gas separation happens at the top of the column. Aeration and liquid circulation are used to achieve mixing. Degassing takes place at the top of the column in a gas liquid separation zone and in an external loop VPBRs the degassing liquid is cycled via an external circulation. The airlift PBR had a greater dry biomass weight and chlorophyll-a concentration than the bubble column PBR shown in Table 1. 2.1.5. Open v s closed system The characteristics of microalgal growth and composition are de pends on the environmental factors and mode of cultivation photo trophic heterotrophic mixotrophic and photoheterotrophic . Phototrophic cultivation occurs in light where solar energy atmo spheric CO2 and water combine to produce chemical energy through photosynthesis. Most of the research is grasped through the photoau totrophic and heterotrophic modes of cultivation so that algae can grow under mixotrophic and photoheteropic modes Vargas et al. 2018 Su et al. 2020 . Based on mode two processes open system and closed system are used for biofuel production and other value-added products. Table 1 is listed the advantages and disadvantages of the various culturing systems. Open pond systems called raceway ponds are the highly energy-efficient and microalgae species Chlorella pyrenoidosa Spirulina sp. etc. can achieve the high yield at reasonable energy costs. Big open systems can be used for microalgae cultivation to produce proteins β-carotene and value-added products. The advantage of an open pond system is that construction and operation are easier. However it requires a highly selective environ ment because the environmental parameters are not controllable due to contamination from other algae and protozoans. This makes mono culture cultivation difficult because it needs a highly sophisticated environment to maintain the pure culture condition. However a small group of algal trains such as Chlorella nutrient-rich medium Dunaliella salina need very saline medium and Spirulina adaptable to high alkalinity can flourish under such extreme condition. As compare to closed photobioreators systems in term of biomass productivity the open pond systems are less efficient. It can be attributed to several deter mining factors including evaporation temperature and radiation fluc tuation CO2 deficiencies and inefficient mixing. Although evaporative losses contributes cooling and it may also results in significant changes to the ionic composition of growth medium with detrimental effects on the algae growth Anandraj et al. 2019 Barten et al. 2021 . Seasonal and diurnal fluctuations of temperature are very difficult to control in open ponds Ahmad et al. 2017 . Potential CO2 deficiencies due to diffusion into the atmosphere may reduce biomass production due to inefficient utilization of CO2. Also poor mixing may result in poor mass CO2 transfer rates causing low biomass productivity. Light limitation due to top layer thickness may also reduce biomass productivity. The algal cultivation systems are varies and it depends on the desire product and strains. Various biomass-based products used in energy recovery include biodiesel bioethanol biobutanol biohydrogen and biogas. For the traditional heterotrophic cultivations for microalgal biotechnology large scale production are needed to reduce the size of cultivation area that consequently reduces production and downstream processing cost. Although light is a limiting factor microalgae have high light utilization efficiency and high biomass concentrations. The main idea of using sunlight to produce value added compounds has many limitations and it depends on the light regime inside the cultivation system which is the main component of design and scaling of PBR. Photobioreactors have a higher diversity of shapes and configurations the most common being tubular bubble column air-lift and flat-panel. Currently close photobioreactor have received significant research attention. Furthermore commercial-scale production of cultured biomass is needed to increase the accessibility of algal biomass which is directly or indirectly influenced by the type of closed photobioreactors CPBRs used. Hence to achieve the maximum viability of CPBRs at the commercial scale several researchers investigated CPBRs especially the construction materials used additionally other influencing parameters of CPBRs are assessed to evaluate the commercial feasibility of CPBRs for algal biomass production. Tubular PBR are considered the best culture system in cooler climatic settings with no overheating worries. In a tropical environment raceways or open ponds may be more suitable so that a large amount of the water requirement is met. A hybrid reactor is made by combining a PBR and a raceway Kothari et al. 2019a 2019b . In the morning hours culturing algae could be done in the PBR and by afternoon they could be moved to the raceway. Yet again the culture could come back to the PBR in the evening hours. For diverse segments of the life cycle a PBR and an open pond could be used simultaneously Ahmad et al. 2017 . Various types of bioreactors are available for culturing algal biomass. According to literature and working conditions open and closed-type bioreactors are used for most experimental studies. Table 1 recapitulates the benefits and shortcomings besides a few good features of all PBRs varieties. 2.2. Growth parameters The most important influencing parameters for regulation of algal growth are nutrients quality and quantity pH light intensity temper ature. The optimal parameter ranges are species-specific and they all are interdependent. The growth parameters decide the output prod ucts of microalgae cultivation. Fig. 5 illustrates the various growth parameters required for algae growth which can improve the economic feasibility of microalgae cultivation for desired needs. A detailed description of individual parameters is provided in the following sections. S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 80 2.2.1. Nutrients Biodiesel production from microalgae is lucid as well as intricate. The essential requirement for survival is only water H2O CO2 and sunlight. However to produce biodiesel a considerable amount of microalgae is needed requiring sufficient nutrients. Thus large-scale algal production is not possible without proper nutritional support. The macronutrients like nitrogen N and phosphorus P are the pre requisites for algae growth. N plays an important role in efficient pro tein carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and their shortage. P is an important micronutrient for the structure and metabolic needs of algae. It is part of algal nucleic acid long-chain polyphosphate and phos phoproteins. It plays an important role in cell division and nutrient starvation leads to the accumulation of triacylglycerol TGA Solo vchenko et al. 2014 . Besides macronutrients micronutrients such as magnesium Mg potassium K calcium Ca manganese Mn Zinc Zn and Sulfur S are also required. Cells lose chlorophyll in the Mg deficit whereas sulfur deficiency suppresses cell division Fozer et al. 2017 . Iron Fe is an obligatory element for pertinent photosynthesis. For media preparation of marine algae sodium chloride NaCl is also an imperative aspect. Specific prevalent media compositions are enlisted Fig. 5. Factor affecting input and out variable of microalgae. Table 2 Composition of media used for algae g L . Chemical name Formula BBM Ramírez-L opez et al. 2016 BG11 S. Ahmad et al. 2021 I.

Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 81 in Table 2. The environmental circumstances and algal nutrient composition could chiefly affect the N content in the algae. For optimum algal growth the elements silicon for diatoms should be provided. The nutrient medium should be appended with some salts like K in saline groundwater usage to grow algae. Various types of wastewater have also been tested for culturing algae. The microalgal cells consume N and P for their growth and this is how the N and P are removed Wang et al. 2014 . The degradation of nutrients is also performed by the microor ganisms on the condition that they are present in the microalgal culture. Through the process of nitrification and denitrification the degradation of ammonia nitrate and nitrite could result with the aid of few distinct bacteria. Algal cells could enthrall the inorganic nitrogen after it has been converted to NO3 - form through the nitrification process or it could be degraded into gas nitrogen continually. Besides the physical re actions chemical reactions like absorption ion exchange sedimentation as well as precipitation perform an essential part in reducing P Shah et al. 2018 . Through microbial actions too phosphate could be despoiled to a great extent. Moreover P could be removed through precipitation once the pH of the microalgal culture upsurges. The concentration of lipids increases as a result of nitrogen deficit. But at the same time biomass production is hampered as a result of lipid accumulation. In N defi ciency sunlight a limiting factor is augmented so that the biomass could be retained. Algal cells develop a protein deficiency but a boost of carbohydrate is seen as nitrogen is required for protein rather than carbohydrates. In the case of micronutrient deficiency photosynthesis occurs at a slower rate. Commercial grade fertilizers envisioned for traditional crops and they could be used as a nutrient source instead of expensive media. The discarded biomass can also be used as fertilizers after oil extraction Milledge and Heaven 2013 . Nutrients are crucial elements which regulate the algal metabolism for production of various valuable chemicals and biofuels. Thus optimizing the dose of various nutrients is essential to improve algae cultivation s economic viability. 2.2.2. Water Water is mandatory for algal growth and their conversion into bio fuel. Notwithstanding climatic conditions algal species grown in race way ponds and CPBRs have enormous water availability. Subsequently freshwater sources are restricted in regions where algae s productivity is maximum i.e. expanses of intense solar radiation throughout the year . Saline water is also necessary for the growth of algal culture. Moreover the freshwater source culture is impossible in almost all situations as the supply of freshwater is limited. Algal growth would be affected tempo rally when the fatalities through evaporation would be substituted by the open pond salinity. A fractional blow-down or complete emanci pation of the open pond water should be done when the algae s endurance range is narrow similar to many marine algal forms . Fortunately algae have the potential to grow both in fresh water and in wastewater including seawater. Similarly water and nutrients are the most critical variables for algal biomass production. Various researchers are exploiting this ability and efforts are in place to develop sustainable synergistic and integrated approaches for algal production by treating nutrient-rich wastewater Pathak et al. 2015 . 2.2.3. Wastewater Microalgae are oxygen-producing photosynthetic microorganisms similar to terrestrial plants. They are common in several environments like fresh and marine water and different wastewater such as municipal wastewater agricultural runoff industrial etc. . However wastewaters have different physicochemical properties compared to the marine and fresh waters or standard culture media. Thus algae have a peculiar ability to utilize various wastewaters as wastewater contains macronu trients such as N and P which are necessary for algal growth and presence of organic matter in the wastewater acts as a carbon source to synthesize carbohydrates proteins and lipids. Based on the molecular formula C106H263O110N16P of algae dos Santos et al. 2017 biomass produced from the utilization of wastewater it takes 0.063 g N and 0.009 g P while C and N contribute more than 50 and 7.3 to the mass weight Li et al. 2019 . The ratio of N P and C N varies signifi cantly with wastewaters while microalgae coordinate with nutrient and balance N P ratio in biomass. Several researchers found increasing the N P ratio in microalgae inversely affects productivity Nguyen et al. 2020 . The ratio of N P could vary between 4 and 40 however a range of 6.8 10 is considered optimal for microalgal growth and efficient removal of pollutants Huo et al. 2020 . During the strain screening process of microalgae for wastewater treatment multiple criteria are established such as fast growth rate high nutrient removal rate robust adaptability and high biomass pro ductivity. The high growth rate depends on adaptability which is positively correlated with a high nutrient removal rate. There are several genera belonging to microalgae that have been reported for wastewater treatment. The commonly reported genus belong to Chlorella which includes species such as C. kessleri C. emersonii C. pyrenoidosa C. sor okiniana C. vulgaris and C. reinhardtii and so on. Other species such as Anabaena doliolum Anabaena osaquae Arthrospira platensis Auxeno chlorella protothecoides Botryococcus braunii Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Desmodesmussp Dunaliella salina Haematococcus pluvialis Hindakiasp Isochrysis galbana Nannochloropsissp Neochlorisoleo abundans Micro cystic aeruginosa Oscillatoriasp Phaeodactylum tricornutum Phormidium bohneri Scenedesmus sp. Synechococcus elongates Trentepohlia aurea have also been reported. Table 3 summarizes algae species along with composition commonly used in wastewater treatment. 2.2.4. Light Light is the source of energy like other plants for algal photosyn thesis. Light intensity spectral quality and photoperiod are the crucial variables for algal growth. Light intensity high low requirements are highly specific to the type of culture strain used. This holds virtuous as the light energy could be made easily accessible through sunlight. However it becomes rather challenging to exploit the energy from biomass fabrication as there is an exertion of exposing the algal culture to a sufficient amount of light energy as depicted in Fig. 6. The microalgae could harness the wavelength range of 400 700 nm from an expansive realm of solar radiation. This particular solar radiation is termed active photosynthetic radiation PAR and 43 of the incoming solar radiation lies in the PAR expanse based on energy Ahmad et al. 2019a 2019b . The photosystem receives a good amount of the capti vated light energy by pigment-protein antenna complexes. There is a separation of charge by the red photon s energy and consequently quinones become the receiver of the liberated electrons in Photosystem II PS-II . Like all terrestrial plants algae photosynthesize and transform gaseous CO2 into organic substances specifically carbohydrates by procuring energy from sunlight. Because of the primary pigments chlorophyll a and b algal growth is enhanced in blue and red lights as these pigments are subtle to such wavelengths and used for light har vesting Hong et al. 2017 . The cells of Chlorella vulgaris absorbs light in the range of 400-500 nm blue besides 625-675 nm red however the remaining solar light was dissipated in between the algal cells Wang et al. 2014 . Similarly it was found that the volume of Scenedesmus obliquus cells enlarged and the nuclear splitting eventuated expedi tiously in red light 625-675 nm . In the photosynthetic process the autotrophic microalgae transform the CO2 into organic compounds by harnessing the visible light. Artificial light in photoautotrophic and mixotrophic microalgae is also explained. The yield and superiority of the biomass are the two regulatory features when the achievement of any industrial or agricultural merchandise is to be determined. The photosynthetic photon flux density PPFD photoperiod and light spectral regulation could be synchronized for microalgal production using artificial light. This would help in achieving the aforementioned features. A restricted proportion of sunlight is available during the S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 82 daytime and the sunlight aggregate is quite capricious cloud cover . Moreover in the winter months certain world regions receive scanty sunlight thereby necessitating an alternative source of light which could be manipulated for uninterrupted algal production. Table 4 summarized the various light sources natural and artificial according to availability and their specificity in terms of algal growth. 2.2.5. Temperature For algal growth temperature proves to be a strong influencing parameter. Temperature alone determines N uptake CO2 fixation and organization of the cells thereby persuading every algal species growth rate. An increase in temperature leads to an increased growth rate until it reaches the optimum. After reaching the optima the growth rate gradually declined due to increasing temperature Table 5 . A positive correlation is seen between temperature augmentation and photosyn thesis and cell division beneath optimum growth temperatures. The tendency is elucidated by the augmentation of enzymatic accomplishments associated with the Calvin cycle Mourelle et al. 2017 . A comprehensive study and modeling have been reported to study the interconnection between growth rate and below optimum temperature. Using the Arrhenius function temperature coefficient Q10 growth rate escalation by 10 C upsurge in the temperature rate of growth escalates is frequently used as a factor and is anticipated to give a value nearby 2. An increase in temperature will become hostile for algal growth photosynthetic activity and division of cells while growth duple with every 10 C rise in temperature. Microalgal growth rate shows an abrupt fall when the temperature required for growth sur passes the optimal temperature. This abrupt decline in microalgal growth is due to the heat stress that distresses the enzymatic functions inactivation denaturation and denatures the proteins entailed in photosynthesis Rizwan et al. 2017 . When a graph is plotted for the growth of microalgae alongside temperature a bell-shaped curve is obtained. The optimal growth temperature for microalgal cultivation generally ranges between 20 24 C and sometimes it vary with the composition of the culture medium. The effect of temperature on the phosphorous concentration in wastewater was also studied using algae. It was found that at elevated temperatures 25 C the phosphorous amount was comparatively higher than at lower temperatures Pasaribu et al. 2016 . Besides phosphorus the elevated temperature was also found to increases the update of various metals such as that arsenic tungsten zinc and cadmium. 2.2.6. pH For the growth of microalgae and biofuel production pH is consid ered an imperative environmental factor. For the growth of microalgae and cyanobacteria the optimum pH ranges are prominently dependent on species type. The optimal pH for most microalgae species lies be tween 7 and 9 Rai et al. 2015 . The features of microalgal biochemical reactions often determine the pH of the cultivated medium. The whole algal culture may subside if the optimum pH is not maintained because all cellular processes may get disturbed at higher pH. According to Gao et al. 2012 the most favorable pH for C. marina was between 7.5 and 8.5 beyond which the microalgal growth was substantially decremented. 2.2.7.

In natural conditions algae assimilate CO2 in the afternoon and convert it into different valuable products. Microalgae can release some CO2 during night time as similar to the other green plants Razzak et al. 2013 . Calvin Cycle C3 pathway followed by most of the microalgae for CO2 sequestration. In the C3 pathway CO2 and 5-carbon 5C compound bind with each other to yield 3-carbon 3C compounds and the reaction is catalyzed by Ribulose-1 5-bisphosphate carboxylase RuBisCo enzyme Yun et al. 2021 . Chlorella pyrenoidosa pose high CO2 sequestration capacity. According to Adamczyk et al. 2016 species of the genera Chlorella Spirulina Scenedesmus Chlor ococcum and Nannochloropsis are shown rapid growth and tolerance to stress factors. Besides they can tolerate high concentrations of CO2 which is evident by their high CO2 accumulation and utilization Table 6 . Moreover the CO2 fixation efficiency is improved due to higher light consumption Zabed et al. 2020 . Jacob et al. 2015 found that carbon-capturing efficiencies for raceway ponds could be between 40 and 70 whereas closed photobioreactor can achieve more than Table 4 Comparison between natural and artificial sources of light and their specific properties. Light source Spectral pattern of light Specific properties Refs. Day light Sun is the only source of light accessible in adequate amounts to carry out photosynthesis for the period of certain times of the year The required amount of energy is not in the veracious wavelength Wungrampha et al. 2018 Incandescent light Incandescent light includes lights from bulbs. The use of this light for algal growth is very challenging due to heat production and the inability to concentrate at one point. Yeh and Chung 2009 Cool white florescent lights Fluorescent lamps produce less powerful light. Normally the lifespan is 10 000 h roughly a year . Tibocha Bonilla et al. 2018 Halogens Halogen light as well as the incandescent lamps share the analogous spectrum therefore has a truncated competence for photosynthesis Luo et al. 2019 Light emitting diodes LED Most of the radiated light would be concentrated into the PBR as LEDs are very directional. The lifespan of LEDs is longer than the traditional light sources. It curtails the cost comparative with the traditional light sources for prolonged time period. Entire red LEDs have been used in this particular experiment so there is diminutive light produced in the wavelength range of 400 500 nm. Ouzounis et al. 2015 S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 84 90 . In raceway pond systems maintenance of the environmental pa rameters light temperature system circulation and rate of CO2 fixa tion is difficult. In contrast a closed photobioreactor is easy to manage and operate Razzak et al. 2013 . In fact last few decades the effect of CO2 concentration on microalgal growth in photobioreactors has been investigated by various researchers Kassim and Meng 2017 . Chen et al. 2020 reported that the highest growth of Nannochloropsis salina was observed at 6 CO2 whereas Tripathi et al. 2015 found the op timum growth of Scenedesmus sp. ISTGA1 at 15 CO2. Tang et al. 2011 cultivated Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa with different concentrations of CO2 ranging from 0.03 to 50 and found a maximum CO2 fixation rate at 10 CO2 for both microalgae. Therefore 5 10 CO2 concentration is considered an optimal range for the culti vation and sequestration of microalgae Table 6 . 3. Downstream processing There are multiple steps required for the production of biofuels and valuable chemicals from microalgae biomass. The harvesting of micro algae biomass from liquid medium and extraction of the desired prod ucts are a complex and expensive processes. These processes are the key factors that determine the economic viability and quality of microalgal products. 3.1. Harvesting The efficient collection of algal biomasses is a challenge for the algal- based biofuel production process. Harvesting is one of the initial step of downstream processing to achieve solid content from 1.0 to up to 20 . The process costs about 20 30 of biofuel production s overall expense. Harvesting and dewatering together constitute 90 equipment cost to manufacture algal biomass Milledge and Heaven 2013 . The dilute suspension requires constant harvesting which makes it more expensive than the harvesting of terrestrial flora. The energy needed for harvesting through settlement and centrifugation on dry biomass basis is 1 MJ kg for microalgae while that of wood is 0.7 0.9 MJ kg Al-Ho thaly et al. 2015 . Instead of concentrating on recovery micro-algal biodiesel production works had pivoted on the yield and configura tion. For harvesting the microalgae various methods such as sedimen tation flocculation flotation centrifugation filtration or an amalgamation of all these have been employed. These processes have been discussed in the followings section. 3.1.1. Physical methods Centrifugation is the major physical method used for extracting the secondary metabolites and producing value-added products. The effi ciency of algal biomass harvesting differs in the one-step or two-step centrifugation methods. However the cell structure can be damaged by the gravitational force and shear stress. Moreover this technique requires huge capital and energy consumption therefore it seems economically incompatible. For the harvesting of 1 kg of algal biomass via centrifugation 1 MJ of energy is required. In general it results in high energy consumption 700 MJ dry tone of algae high GHG emis sion 50 kg CO2 eq dry tone of algae and high equipment cost as compared to other methods Pacheco et al. 2015 . The solids are separated from the liquids and gases by filtration from a membrane through which only fluid could pass. The algal slurry is retained by a porous membrane and the remaining water moves through a filter. For accelerating the filtration via a porous membrane pressure tempera ture and concentration is needed. For harvesting the microalgae various filtration processes such as vacuum macro micro ultra pres sure filtration and tangential flow filtration TFF have been exploited Milledge and Heaven 2013 . The advantages and disadvantages of various filtration processes are described in detail in Table 7. Though filtration seems to be a better technique for the microalgae of consid erably large size it isn t applicable for small size algal species like Dunaliella Chlorella and Scenedesmus. To harvest fragile cells ultra-filtration and membrane micro-filtration is more favored due to their nominal cost low chemical consumption and low energy requirement. Before the water treatment algae are separated from their culture medium through micro strainers. The mesh size of the micro strainers is generally in the range of 15 64 mm allowing the passage of the finest algae through it. The small algal cells Chlorella and Cyclotella of pore size 0.1 10 mm can be effectively separated through micro filtration.Whereas Macro-filtration is usually applied for large Table 5 Effect of temperature on the growth of algae.

Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 85 microalgal cell sizes and is often used for flocs filtration Mathimani and Mallick 2018 . Though ultra-filtration could be well applied for recovering the fragile microalgal cells it is not generally used for dew atering the microalgal because it suffers from the costly operation high maintenance cost high electricity consumption and requirement of the special membrane. For instance for the production of 6 dry slurry of microalgae 0.4 kW h m3 energy is needed. TFF can recover 70 89 of algae from freshwater Pragya et al. 2013 and is considered an energy-efficient method for harvesting microalgae. TFF has a certain advantage over the centrifugation technique as the former is capable of retaining the complete structure and associated properties of the microalgal cells in the slurry after harvesting while the latter damages the intact cell structure of the microalgal cells after harvesting. Dead-end filtration is an appropriate technique for microalgal cells of 70 mm cell diameter. Though it is an extensively applied technique for harvesting microalgae its operation cost is enhanced due to clog ging. The gravity sedimentation technique involves solid-liquid sepa ration in which the slurry is precipitated due to gravity and a clear liquid is left as supernatant. The reliability in gravity sedimentation is quite low because microalgal cells density keeps changing though it gives the solid concentrations of 1.5 . Sedimentation time and velocity determine the efficacy of gravity sedimentation which is directly linked to the cytoplasmic density. Generally the cytoplasm density of the cyanobacteria marine diatoms and microalgae range from 1.082 to 1.104 g cc3 1.03 to 1.23 g cc3 and 1.03 to 1.1 g cc3 respectively. Whereas the mean sedimentation velocity of cyanobacteria diatoms and microalgae is 0.1 m d Liu et al. 2019 . The gravity sedimentation GS process involves low energy and is therefore cost-effective. How ever the consistency is ambiguous because of variable thickening in addition to low slurry output. In some of the research studies it has been reported that the gravity sedimentation process is not efficient in har vesting the low mass microalgae and a significant amount of biomass wanes at the time of settling. In flotation bubbles are formed on which the solid suspended particles get trapped and lifted to the surface of a liquid because of low density. This results in the separation of solids from liquid Barros et al. 2015 . Floatation has certain advantages as it doesn t require much space has good flexibility and also the operating time is comparatively lesser. Hence it has proven to be a good method to harvest freshwater microalgae species Table 7 . Though dispersed air flotation DAF requires quite expensive in struments it is energy efficient whereas electrolytic flotation requires a comparatively huge amount of energy consumption. DAF is a technique generally used for wastewater treatment. The variability of the sus pended particles is the determining factor of the harvesting proficiency through flotation. When the instability is low the contact of airborne particles will be more. Ozonation dispersed flotation ODF is a method Table 7 Advantages and disadvantages of various techniques with their efficiencies for harvesting the algal biomass.

Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 86 in which the ozone gas is passed through the suspension and charged bubbles are produced thereby allowing the cells to float on the surface Mathimani and Mallick 2018 . Yet it is quite expensive and the contamination issues do not make it a suitable method for large-scale application and implementation. 3.1.2. Chemical methods The chemical methods of harvesting are generally called the floc culation process. In this process different coagulants are added to the microalgae slurry that causes microalgal cells to come close to each other and form a gigantic ball. This results in the easy settling of larger algae particles due to gravity. Generally the flocculation process occurs by neutralization patching sweeping and bridging Chen et al. 2015 . As shown in Fig. 7 chemical flocculation is mediated by inorganic and organic polymeric flocculants. During harvesting the microalgal cells are negatively charged which interact with the positively charged chemical flocculants resulting in the successful harvesting of micro algae. The major inorganic flocculants are Fe2 SO4 3 FeCl3 Al2 SO4 3 MgCl2 NH4 2SO4 AlCL3 ZnSO4 ZnCl2 CaCl2 and NH4Cl Mathimani and Mallick 2018 . Mubarak et al. 2019 studied twelve inorganic salts and found that six salts Fe2 SO4 3 FeCl3 Al2 SO4 3 AlCL3 ZnSO4 and ZnCl2 flocculated C. minutissima within 24 h while the rest were inef fective. However inorganic flocculants containing aluminum salts can affect methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria According to Barros et al. 2015 inorganic polymers such as polyaluminum chloride PAC can hinder the enzymatic activity that ceases transesterification. Conse quently the main disadvantage with inorganic flocculants is that they can affect the downstream processes show in Table 8. On the other hand organic flocculants are natural chemically syn thesize or polyelectrolyte. The common organic polymeric flocculants are polyacrylamides cellulose chitosan surfactants certain synthetic fibers etc. Organic flocculants are biodegradable so they don t cause downstream pollution. However they are too expensive compared to inorganic flocculants which makes them unsuitable for large-scale harvesting. The pH is an important factor that regulates the applica bility of organic flocculants for the harvesting of microalgae. Schlesinger et al. 2012 investigated that the harvesting efficiency of Nanno chloropsis sp. culture reached 95 when the culture medium pH was managed to 10. 3.1.3. Biological methods Biological methods represent the flocculation of microalgae harvest from the liquid medium using biological things substances or micro organisms . Different biological agents such as fungi bacteria microalgae and plant-based substances are utilized to harvest micro algae. Although biological methods are low cost and eco-friendly the contamination of microalgae biomass still is a challenge for sophisti cated applications. 3.1.4. Bioflocculation and auto-flocculation These flocculation processes do not require the addition of chemical substances as flocculants instead biopolymers are used to harvest microalgae. Substances like extracellular polymeric substances EPS γ glutamic acids are used as bioflocculants Barros et al. 2015 Chen et al. 2019 . To harvest the biomass from algae the bioflocculation has been categorically divided into bacterial fungal and plant-based floc culation. Several pieces of research suggest that bacteria are great drivers of bio-flocculation. The benefits and drawback of bioflocculation are described in Table 9. A comparatively high EPS concentration pro duced by the bacteria and the capability of the microalgae for flocs formation by getting attached on their surface determines the bio flocculation. The efficiency of flocculation and nutrient removal of 92.0 6.0 and 88.0 2.2 respectively was achieved during bio flocculation by Chlorella vulgaris when it was cultivated in untreated seafood wastewater Nguyen et al. 2020 . The results established the fact that the bioflocculation process was encouraged by bacterial exis tence. An enhancement in the yield of the fatty acids and lipid is noticed when the microorganisms are added. Microbiological contamination arising out of culturing the microalgae with the bacteria fungi and various other microorganisms affects the downstream microalgal pro cessing. Bioflocculation of microalgae is generally done by bacteria nowadays while other sorts of microorganisms like fungi and actino mycetes are yet not considered so far. A gel-like layer that is developed by the EPS on the membrane causes flow resistance leading to mem brane replacement repeatedly. In the case of autoflocculation microalgal cells can adhere to each other and form floc. Generally autoflocculation can occur naturally due to stress of the environment such as a change in pH nutrients tem perature quantities of calcium and magnesium ions in the culture me dium. Microalgae cells form flocs because of negatively charge on surface of cells by easier The electrostatic interactions are hampered due to variation in the Mg2+ and H+ OH- ratio among anionic algae Wan et al. 2015 . When the pH of the culture medium was accustomed to pH 10 the harvesting efficiency of Nannochloropsis sp. increased up to 95 Schlesinger et al. 2012 . The hydroxide OH- ion of K Mg and Ca was added to Chlorella vulgaris for flocculating that yielded the biomass above 98 . NaOH is added for carrying out the process of auto flocculation. The efficiency of biomass recovery of around 90 was achieved for Dunaliella tertiolecta after adding NaOH in the pH range from 8.6 to 10.5 and settling time of few minutes. Some studies inform that polysaccharides show involvement in autoflocculation like poly saccharides synthesized by Scenedesmus obliquus AS-6-1 and Chlorella vulgaris JSC-7 Alam et al. 2016 . Various species of microalgae exhibit autoflocculation characteristics among which Ettliatexensis SAG79.80 Scenedesmus obliquus AS-6-1 Chlorella vulgaris JSC-7 and Ankistrodesmus falcatus are prominent Salim et al. 2012 . The bioflocculation and autoflocculation methods for microalgal harvesting are simple cost-effective and demand less energy. A comprehensive life cycle assessment of microalgal bioflocculation is indispensable to understand the overall energy consumption and processing charge for laboratory and large-scale industrial applications. In the downstream processing and production of various products secondary pollution is not caused. During bioflocculation the EPS given by the microalgae during floccu lation follows the dual mechanism of patching and bridging Fig. 8 . When the microalgal cells are closely associated with one another the patching mechanism works whereas as a large network of new cells formed throughout the culture medium which is due to bridging mechanism. However the different microbial mechanisms involved in bioflocculation and autoflocculation remain unexplored. Fig. 7. Processes of harvesting of microalgae. S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 87 3.2. Extraction of lipid and its conversion to fuel The lipid extraction method from algal cells comes after cell har vesting. Biodiesel productions through microalgae are two techniques like bio-prospecting of high-lipid-containing strains and stimulation of lipid production through strain enhancement approaches both physio logically applicable. Lipid extraction is technically and economically feasible and algal strains with low lipid content 10 can also be uti lized for biodiesel production. The limitations and advantages of these processes have been sum marized in Table 10. After lipid extraction it is converted into fatty acid through transesterification. Transesterification refers to the chemical way that converts the fatty acid into the fatty acid methyl esters FAME termed as biodiesel Ahmad et al. 2019a 2019b . In this process viscosity of FAME is reduces. Initially the transesterification process was carried out using the base or acid catalysis but now alternative methods such as enzymatic transesterification methanolysis and mi crowave assisted transesterification have also been studied. After extraction of lipid from algae the lipid extracted algae LEA is leftover that provides comparable high yields of protein and low sugars to those from whole-cell algae. LEA is an important by-product that needs to be measured after extracting the bio-crude of algae. It is utilized for cattle feed and coal power plant fuel. LEA is also used as heavy metal biosorbents. LEA has high ammonia and nitrogen content and the concentration might be greater than that seen in whole-cell algal digestate. The efficiency of energy production and nutrient recycling by an aerobically digested LEA usually produced more methane than whole-cell algae but many inhibitory factors such as toxicity of ammonia algal cell resistance and nutrient consumption by bacteria could reduce the effectiveness of LEA. In the transesterification process alcohol and triglycerols are mixed in a proportion of 3 1 M for generating biodiesel. The distinct properties of the glycerol and FAME are demarcated as the former gets down in the base due to substantial density whereas the latter stays at the apex Chew et al. 2017 . Approximately 80 of the extricated algal oil vol ume could yield biodiesel Ahmad et al. 2019a 2019b . During trans esterification usually chemical catalysts acids bases or biological catalysts enzymes are applied. Numerous chemical catalysts like NaOH KOH Al2O3 BaO SrO Cao Zeolites HCO3 Na and K alkoxides like sodium methoxide Na-OCH3 sodium ethoxide Na-OC2H5 so dium propoxide Na-OC3H7 and sodium butoxide Na-OC4H9 have been employed for biodiesel production Ogunkunle et al. 2017 . Some chemical catalysts mainly acids like sulfonic acid sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid are used for biodiesel generation. For the action of enzymatic biocatalysts lipases are deployed. Transesterification cata lyzed by alkali catalyst is expeditious 4000 times than the acid-catalyzed. Though alkali catalyzed reaction is hasty however it could result in saponification because of the amount of free fatty acids FFA 2 Mandal et al. 2013 . The water formed during the alkaline transesterification could usher the saponification reaction therefore triglycerides and alcohol used in the process should be extensively anhydrous. When an exorbitant amount of FFA 2 is to be transformed into esters acid-catalyzed transesterification proves to be a pragmatic approach. The problem that ensues from acid-catalyzed transesterification is that besides being a cumbersome method it is attained at high temperature 100 C and pressure hence it is quite Table 8 Different chemical flocculants and their efficiencies in the harvesting of microalgae.

Energy intensiveness saponification menace segregation problem of catalyst and products the obstacle in glycerol retrieval are some of the challenges while using chemical catalysis. For trans esterification the enzymes could be very well employed as they demonstrate notable endurance to lipid s FFA content. At a temperature range of 35 45 C lipase transesterification is performed guaranteeing no catalytic activity of saponification Razzak et al. 2013 . The en zymes actions are curtailed in the transesterification reaction as the restrained surface of the lipase coheres with glycerol. The reason behind why this method is not being used commercially is because the lipase enzyme is quite expensive and there arises a difficulty in salvaging the glycerol from a restrained lipase surface. The enzymatic trans esterification would be a preferred method only if the restriction of the enzyme and multiple enzymes are performed oppositely. In Table11 various processes of transesterification are compared based on the catalyst used in the process. After extracting lipid from the algal cell a significant amount of residual biomass 70 remains unutilized because lipid constitutes only 25 32 of total algae biomass. This re sidual biomass is another important source of valuable products which comprises vitamins proteins and different chemicals. It results in zero waste and the end product of algae biomass can be utilized as fertilizer for the agriculture field. 3.3. Value-added products The potential use of algal biomass is not restricted only to biodiesel and biohydrogen production but also in applications such as biogas bioethanol bio-methanol bio-plastics medicinal value bio-ferilizer and animal food production Kothari et al. 2017 . Microalgal cultiva tion is significant to achieve high algal biomass having a wide range of applications in a different field polysaccharides lipids pigments pro teins vitamins bioactive compounds and antioxidants etc. . However more in-depth studies need to be conducted on the increase of micro algae cultivation and advanced processing techniques to set-up the po tential of algal culture for biofuel production Fig. 9 . The substitute of microalgae biofuels which have high productivity possibilities and no competition with conventional food crops is becoming popular gradu ally. Microalgae synthesize various bioactive chemicals such as lipids carbohydrates protein and pigment which show medicinal qualities. The difference between nutraceuticals and medicines is not possible food and dietary supplement depending on the country to country. Nutraceuticals products from algae have ability to improve the health prevent chronic diseases increase life expectancy and provide structural functional support to the body. An efficient food can provide supplementary or improved benefits over and above its basic dietetic value. Due to high protein content microalgae have been a good source of the different classes of lipids polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA pigments vitamins Aratboni et al. 2019 Katayama et al. 2020 and bioactive compounds Table 12 . These bioactive compounds are syn thesized within the microalgal cells are exposed to different stresses such as nutrient starvation temperatures and UV irradiation pH etc. . Red microalgae eg. Cyanidios chyzonmerolae produce a broad spectrum of carotenes which are natural colorants used in different pharmaceu tical and cosmetic products. Spirulina is a good source of Phycocyanin which grows in an open pond for commercial production Kannaujiya et al. 2019 . Several novel bioactive chemical compounds like carra geenans fucoidans ulvans etc. are extracted from the marine brown microalgae such as Clasdosiphon okamranus Chordaricles neacystus Chordaricles Nenacystus Hydrilla sp. and F. ocussp. The anticancer and antioxidants effects of these novel compounds are in the clinical trial. Carotenoids pigments are used as a coloring agent for fruits and vegetables and other food ingredients. Borowitzka 2013 founds that Dunaliella salina produces the highest content of beta-carotene and Astaxanthin respectively of any organism. This can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain categories of cancer like lung and breast cancer. Microalgal culture systems are used to produce long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are important human growth supplements. Besides microalgal lipids are also utilized for the production of biodiesel. After extensive literature survey on biomass-based value-added products VAPs including con version route of biomass to biofuel influencing parameters and further uses of residual biomass for secondary bioenergy options providing a new insight for bio-economy. The bio-economy concept is significant for further challenges like energy crisis environmental imbalances and unsustainability on planet earth. Fig. 8. Biological harvesting mechanism. S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 89 4. The key challenges and prospects Although microalgae biomass has shown vibrant applications with developing technology several concerns need to be resolved to utilize microalgae biomass better. These concerns lie with both biofuel pro ductions and value-added products. Though significant research has been conducted to reduce the operational cost of microalgae production and processing as well as of various refining technologies involved in biodiesel production the commercial application is still a challenge. To promote microalgal biodiesel production the main hurdles that limit its large-scale application should be keenly identified and researched i inefficient growth of pure culture-specific microalgae species in large quantities for large scale application is a major obstacle Fig. 10 . This is because the microalgal growth rate and production of lipids are greatly Table 10 Different types of extraction processes and their efficiencies for algal lipid yield advantages and disadvantages.

Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 91 hampered when these are infected by other species. Thus efforts are required to identify and grow efficient cultures that can survive poten tial contaminates and yield higher. ii The cultivation cost of micro algae in the PBRs demanded 47.4 cost and a major portion of cost involve in power consumption materials design and operation. The cost of energy consumption and construction significantly decreases when the microalgae are cultivated under optimized conditions. For improving and optimizing the design of the photo-bioreactors and making it economically feasible there is a huge difference amid the design of an inexpensive and high-end reactor. iii The species of the microalgae and various growth environments determine the lipid yield. So the importance of the selection of suitable microalgae species and environmental conditions are directly affect the lipid production. The lipid productivity is hampered in certain cases because there exists an opposing association amid the cell growth and lipid accumulation thereby necessitating to prioritize the optimization of microalgae growth conditions. Thus there is a need to establish optimized micro algae growth conditions that can ensure high lipid productivity. iv Difficulty in separating the additives from the biomass of algae is the major hindrance in harvesting. Exhaustive research should be carried out to answer certain existing problems of rate and recovery of the harvest enhancement without hampering the downstream processes of biodiesel production like quality and production. For large scale bio diesel production the main focus should be on the identification of an operatively feasible and cost-effective cultivation system of microalgae optimization of the microalgae culture environment for the enhanced rate of growth and lipid productivity including the cutting-edge tech nologies for separation and harvesting the biomass of microalgae.

Algae and its value-added products. S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 92 4.1. Microalgae cultivation perspective Light and temperature are the main component of photobioreactors that enhanced the energy and cost input of microalgae cultivation. However utilization of LED lightning systems somehow reduced the light energy input but consistent and constant maintenance of temper ature is still a great challenge in way of energy reduction. Apart from cost various technical factors are also affect the cultivation of microalgae in photobioreactors such as mixing mass transfer abiotic conditions and growth kinetics of microalgae. Natural solar light is the freely available source that can easily reduce the light energy of cultivation but photoinhibition is the main drawback of it. Temperature can also pro vide by nature light because microalgae need a temperature range of 15 35 C but in photobioreactors in natural light it rises more than 40 C that reduces the growth as well as biochemical productivity of microalgae Osama et al. 2021 . Therefore design consideration of cultivation systems open pond and closed photobioreactors need to maintain light and temperature control so that energy input of cultiva tion systems must be reduced. The average total cost of lipid production is estimated at 12.73 gal for photobioreactor while 31.61 gal for open pond. This indicated that the cost of biofuel production is higher in the open pond as compared to the photobioreactor. Zhu et al. 2018 used bag type photobioreactor plant for microalgae cultivation and they estimated a total cost of about 22.7 million USD yr in which nutrients bag photobioreactors replacement and CO2 are shared 60 cost of total production. Thus maximizing the reusable cultivation system including Table 12 Different value-added products from the microalgae. Components Algae Products Application Refs.

Way forward for sustainable microalgae production. S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 93 open and photobioreactors can able to reduce the cultivation cost. However wastewater and CO2 from thermal power plants can partici pate as import variable for cost reduction because of wastewater and CO2 available at almost zero cost. Microalgae cultivation and harvesting should not be aimed only for commercial biodiesel and bio-refinery production it should also engulf various other value-added products like biochar proteins vitamins pigments and nutraceuticals which will lower the overall production cost of biodiesel production. Microalgae-based third-generation bio- refinery is still in the developing phase and it conceptualized by inte grating various routes at zero waste and low emission. The main chal lenge with microalgae-bio-refinery is cost and technology because extraction of valuable chemicals from microalgae needs sophisticated techniques that enhance the cost. More rigorous research and develop ment need to ensure the sustainability and profitability of microalgae bio-refinery. 4.2. Genetic engineering perspective Chlorella Dunaliella Haematococcus Spirulina Nannochloropsis are well accepted industrial microalgae species which are widely adopted worldwide and they produced numerous products which are utilized for feed food and medicine sectors. Modern engineering science such as biotechnology metabolic and genetic engineering are able to change the metabolic pathway of microalgae that induced biosynthesis of bio chemicals in the cell. Consequently desired produces can be successfully achieved. Misra et al. 2012 analyzed genome-wide identification and characterization of 398 putative genes in lipid biosynthesis in a group of microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardti Ostreococcus lucimarinus Ostreo coccus tauri and Cyanidioschyzon morelae Volvox carteri. They suggested that orthologous proteins involve in the core lipid metabolic pathway in microalgae. The manipulations of phytohormones and nutrients stress are enhanced biomass and biochemical production including lipid pro duction. Auxins Indole-3-acetic acid IAA diethyl aminoethyl hex anoate DAH can easily regulate biomass and lipid production in microalgae cells. S. obliquus increased their biomass content by 1.9-2.5 fold through IAA used. Similary 2 4-D improved 40 biomass produc tivity in Dunaliella tertiolecta. Scenedesmus quadricauda Chlorella sor okiniana Nannochloropsis oceanica are significantly performed in the nitrogen stress conditions and increased 2.1 fold biomass and lipid accumulation Sun et al. 2018 . There are various pathways of biosynthesis of valuable chemicals are identified in the microalgae cell. The carotenoid biosynthesis pathway has been widely studied and phytoene synthase phytoene desaturase enzymes are widely applied enzymes that improve the production of carotenoids in microalgae. However other enzymes are also involved in the regulation of biosyn thesis of carotenoids. Similarly squalene is produced by down regula tion of squalene epoxidase through RNAi in Chlamydomonas and most of the efforts for chloroplast transformation are also made with Chlamy domonas Kumar et al. 2020 . Various recombinant proteins and anti bodies are potentially produced by genetic engineered microalgae cells. Thus genetic engineering and metabolic engineering can enhance lipid production with various other biochemicals. 4.3. Microalgae harvesting perspective Microalgae harvested by biological methods chemical methods and physical methods. Among these harvesting methods physical methods provide a high quality of biomass whereas chemical and biological methods still are suffering contamination problems. However physical methods are being energy and cost-intensive. Therefore a cost- competitive recyclable and eco-friendly harvesting technique with high purity of biomass is still required. The biological methods are more attractive in future because low-cost and biodegradable nature. Opti mization techniques of flocculation with chemical and biological methods are consistently improving the quality of the harvesting process. However optimization of flocculant dose for microalgae is still mattered of concern because each flocculant has unique characteristics that cannot be applied uniformly for all kind of microalgae. For getting a deeper insight into the mechanisms involved in surface binding of bio flocculant with microalgae cells thermodynamic kinetic isotherm and response surface methodology RSM principles could be used. There are several types of research that have confirmed that genetically modified microalgae can be used for flocculation. Also by altering the algae to prompt a receptor molecule and legend and then adding it to a different culture the antigen so produced could be used for inducing flocculation. The selection of chemical flocculant for the specific use of microalgae can also reduce the cost and environmental burdens such as calcium- based chemical flocculant can be work as a catalyst in the trans esterification process during the conversion of lipid into biodiesel Ahmad et al. 2020a 2020b 2020c . Similarly starch based chemical flocculants can be used for feed application that are not in toxic nature. 4.4. Economy and environmental protection perspective The cultivation cost of the microalgae would be greatly curtailed if it is done in rural areas since the land is available at a reduced rate. Some researchers suggest that collaborating fish and shrimp culture along with microalgae cultivation can boost animal productivity as well as water quality. The techno-economic analysis of the sustainability of biofuels and co-products from algae are analyzed by Cruce and Quinn 2019 . They suggested that hydrothermal liquefaction protein extrac tion with novel pathways and fractionation outcomes compared with other biofuels source at 5.37 USD 4.44 USD 11.13 USD and 4.31 USD respectively. However certain factors should be considered while selecting the land as the geographical environment temperature energy supply and the transportation of the equipment and materials can play important role in cultivation. The raw material cost could be signifi cantly reduced if the wastewater treatment is combined with a high CO2 e.g. 15 concentration which can be used as a nutrient and carbon source. The cost of CO2 reduction and wastewater treatment can posi tively reduce the net cost of microalgae cultivation. However treatment of 1 m3 of wastewater was needed 1.59 kg-CO2 eq m3ww and produced 113 g of algal biocrudes and 2.76 kg-CO2 eq m3ww by conventional process Ishizaki et al. 2020 . It shows that valuable biomass production takes place during wastewater treatment with low CO2 as compared to conventional wastewater treatment. The New strategies are anticipated considering the proficiency and expediency of the microalgal waste water treatment process i Micro-pollutants could be removed by the process ii The clean fresh water along in addition to the fertilizers could be saved which are required for microalgae production iii Recycling the resources and nutrients and recapture the lost energy should be considered and taken care of it. An extensive study is required for evaluating the viability of the method for practical applications. For removing the contaminants thoroughly at a high rate the design oper ation as well as the optimization of operating parameters should be dealt with sternly for making it feasible for large-scale industrial applications. 1 kg microalgae biomass production requires 3494 kg freshwater for biodiesel production and utilization of wastewater 50 concentration is reduced the 39 freshwater while the pure concentration of waste water utilization is reduced 93 freshwater that reached the 219 kg- water kg microalgae biodiesel Feng et al. 2016 . Correa et al. 2019 analyzed that the utilization of seawater for microalgae cultivation could achieve 4.17 1011 L year based on suitable land that is be tween 10 and 20 of total transport energy demand in 2030 and most important is that it could not directly compete with food and biodiver sity. Thus economic and environmental aspects are co-related to each other. Gerbens-Leenes et al. 2014 observed the land use of microalgae-based biofuels ranges from 2 to 200 m2 GJ net energy and water footprint was lies between 8 and 193 m3 GJ net energy. These values of energy provide 3.5 transport fuels in European Union in S. Ahmad et al. Journal of Biotechnology 351 2022 74 98 94 2030 and the highest land productivity needs 17 000 km2 to produce 850 PJ yr. In this way microalgae-based biofuels production can be sustainable by reducing the load on freshwater land energy and emission. 5. Future recommendations The importance of microalgae has been increased because of their economic applications in medicine fuel food and feed. Therefore knowledge about upstream and downstream process is need of current era. In this review various aspects of upstream and downstream are rigorously discussed with their key challenges. The future recommen dations are concluded here for the sustainable microalgae production Cultivation of microalgae with the treatment of wastewater is low cost and low emission process. Thus nutrient recovery from waste water is a cutting edge technology that reduced cost and emission load. Combination of microalgae cultivation with wastewater and CO2 source can be a potential way forward for clean water and air. The water footprint of microalgae cultivation for biofuels production can be reduced by utilization of wastewater as a medium and nu trients concentration of wastewater can also be enhanced the sus tainability by reducing freshwater and replacing chemicals of the medium. Most of the economic analysis of microalgae cultivation is based on lab studies that cannot be completely reliable at the commercial level. So more applied research data is needed from the commercial utilization of microalgae. Although initial results of metabolic engineering and genetic engi neering are showing desired outcomes in the direction of biomass and biochemical production and these are lab-scale results so their implementation at the industrial level is yet to be part of more rigorous research and development. Low cost recyclable and biodegradable flocculants are needed for the harvesting of microalgae that have high harvesting efficiency and they can be effective for various kinds of microalgae. 6. Conclusion Microalgae are acted as the miniature factory for sustainable and cost-effective production of biofuels value-added products and food ingredients. The technical and scientific feasibility of the upstream and downstream processes of microalgae are important for biofuels pro duction and the focus on process parameters that play an important role in the growth and accumulation of value-added chemicals in microalgae cell. It can be seen that the upstream process needed a huge amount of water nutrients and energy that enhances the initial capital cost. Moreover microalgae are prone to contamination and thus require unique cultivation conditions which can be provided in photo bioreactors. The hybrid cultivation systems seem a preferred choice in controlling the environmental conditions i.e. lower the production cost prevent culture contamination . In the case of downstream processes there is no single technique that is appropriate for microalgae harvest ing. The harvesting technique consumes the highest proportion of en ergy and time and thus the adaptation of new technologies for the harvesting and extraction of value-added chemicals may provide possible solutions. Therefore innovative upstream processing and downstream processing should be identified before the process can be applied on a large scale.

Among various biofuel sources algae have gained significant attention due to their high growth rates photosynthetic efficiency and ability to produce lipids and carbohydrates required for Biofuels production. Algae cultivation has no special requirements only water simple salts minerals and sunlight are required. Also biofuel production from algae cultivated in wastewater has an added advantage of wastewater treatment and CO2 sequestration from the environment. Although commercial feasibility of algae based biofuel is still uncertain and so far not clear if it could compete equally with other available fuels in the market. The experts are in favour of pro- motion of algae based biofuels considering the added advantage of carbon sequestration and wastewater treatment approach involved in algae based biofuels. The concept of a circular econ- omy and carbon neutrality in algae cultivation and harvesting are two intertwined approaches that hold great promise for sustainable and environmental friendly algae based biofuel produc- tion. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in algae-based bio- fuel production focusing on cultivation and harvesting techniques factors affecting algae growth algae-based biofuel production technologies and the commercial feasibility of algae for biofuel production. Further research related to cultivation and harvesting developing new species and optimizing the biofuel production process should be carried out to make the prices of algae based biofuels competitive. 1. Introduction Biofuels biomass-derived fuels are nowadays a prominent substitute for fossil fuels since they are an environmentally friendly source of energy. Biofuels have the potential to improve the global energy system reduce dependence on fossil fuels decrease emis- sions of pollutants and supply energy in the form of solid liquid or gas Abd El-Malek et al. 2022 Akter et al. 2020 Raj et al. 2022 . The primary cause of carbon dioxide s presence in the ecosystem is the combustion of fossil fuels by the various energy-driven vehicles. Thus scientific experts have worked hard to develop alternative and sustainable forms of energy production in order to Corresponding author. E-mail addresses S. Tomar S. Agarwal H. Singh R.

Tomar et al. lower its levels in the atmosphere and stop the depletion of non-renewable resources. Producing biofuel from microalgae having enormous potential for lipid accumulation and bioconversion is one such remarkable effort Sathya et al. 2023 . Biofuels are catego- rized into four generations depending on the type of feedstock used for their production Alalwan et al. 2019 . The first-generation biofuels are made from edible feedstocks like corn or sugarcane which may cause food insecurity in the future. The second- generation biofuels are made from cheap and abundant non-food biomass sources such as agricultural remains. The third-generation biofuel are produced from feedstocks like algae specifically microalgae and macroalgae are attracting more attention. The fourth- generation biofuels are those that are produced from genetically modified microbes Sarwer et al. 2022a b . Production of biofuels like biodiesel and biohydrogen from algal biomass is mostly considered as a sustainable alternative to petroleum fuels especially in the transportation sector Rai et al. 2018 Najjar and Abu-Shamleh 2020 . Algae as the third-generation feedstock have the potential to address the energy crisis. However the high production and harvesting cost is the main restriction to its commercialization Chu et al. 2021 . Although the high energy consumption combined with the harvesting phase poses a significant impediment to the sub- stantial commercialization of algal biodiesel Najjar and Abu-Shamleh 2020 . Algae have been gaining significant consideration be- cause of their potential to serve as a feedstock for either biofuel or nutraceutical production. Moreover microalgae have 10 to 50 times more carbon sequestering potential than terrestrial plants Bhola et al. 2014 . Algae are also reported to be used as dietary sup- plements. It is challenging to add algae directly to the food due to their strong flavor and color. Furthermore the addition of algae into food may also affect the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of bioactive substances in microalgae. Therefore a thorough evalua- tion of the health advantages of food derived from algae is necessary. This will make it easier to promote food based on algae Chen et al. 2022 . When environmental conditions pH temperature light carbon dioxide salinity and nutrients changes they may pro- duce and store beneficial substances in the form of cell metabolites Gatamaneni et al. 2018 . Algae are widely distributed short- lived organisms that significantly reduce the pressure from industrial carbon emissions. Additionally algae are a preferred source for recombinant proteins due to their remarkable advantages of being photoautotrophic and containing both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems Ma et al. 2022 . Microalgae cultivation using wastewater has re- ceived attention around the globe as a platform to remove inorganic nutrients from the wastewater and produce microalgae biomass for biodiesel production. This can be accomplished by turning readily available nutrients from wastewater particularly nitrogen and phosphorus into microalgae biomass which will also absorb carbon dioxide CO2 through photosynthesis. Because it is derived from renewable resources microalgae biodiesel could help to reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions to the atmosphere by replacing fossil fuels. Despite the many advantages of producing microalgae biodiesel many technological challenges must be overcome before com- mercializing the product. These challenges include complicated procedures the need for significant energy input during growing and dewatering harvesting operations . In addition a further pre-treatment step is required to damage the microalgae cell wall to in- crease lipid extraction efficiency Kadir et al. 2018 . There are various approaches to increase the lipid carohydrate content of the al- gae. Shi et al. 2022 proposed a novel regulation method to promote the growth and high amylose starch accumulation by a newly isolated Platymonas helgolandica. They reported that adding glucose and controlling the appropriate circadian light and dark time will increase growth rate and amylose concentration Shi et al. 2022 . The attribution of biodiesel production is adequate on a macroscale considering the global energy market. The process of biodiesel production will be of great importance to developing countries in par- ticular due to its cost-effectiveness eco-friendly nature easy operation and potential to replace conventional fuel resources. The first generation bioethanol made with edible feedstocks due to some conflicts this source is currently not thought to be sustainable. De- spite being produced from non-edible sources second-generation bioethanol is not economically viable due to its high production costs. Third-generation bioethanol made from microalgae and macroalgae has been viewed as a possible alternative to decrease pe- troleum fuels because it does not have the problems of its precursor Veza et al. 2022 . The concept of a circular economy and the pursuit of carbon neutrality in algae cultivation and harvest are two intertwined approaches that hold great promise for sustainable and environmental friendly algae based biofuel production Hoang et al. 2022 . In a circular economy resources are maximally uti- lized and waste is minimized. In algae cultivation closed-loop nutrient cycling could be established where nutrients required for growth e.g. nitrogen and phosphorus are sourced from waste streams like wastewater or agricultural runoff Calicioglu and Demirer 2022 . Algae absorb these nutrients cleaning the water and converting them into biomass. Carbon neutrality could be pro- moted by sourcing nutrients from waste streams and utilizing carbon dioxide from industrial processes or the atmosphere Osorio- Reyes et al. 2023 . Algae absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis offsetting emissions from other sources making algae cultiva- tion carbon-neutral Daneshvar et al. 2022 . Another approach that could be used is after lipid extraction for biofuel production residual biomass could be utilized in other applications such as animal feed fertilizers or bioplastics Beckstrom et al. 2020 . Again utilizing residual biomass reduces waste and maximizes the carbon capture potential of the microalgae Wicker et al. 2023 . Sustain- able harvesting methods and continuous cultivation systems could ensure a constant supply of algae without disrupting the ecosys- tem making the process more cost-effective A. A. Khan et al. 2022 . Also using energy-efficient harvesting techniques such as grav- ity settling or electrocoagulation minimizes the energy footprint and supports carbon neutrality Ogbonna and Nwoba 2021 Hoang et al. 2022 analyzed the role of microalgae in the circular economy and suggested that the potential of scaling up current microalgae- based production could benefit from the waste-to-energy strategy with microalgae as a key intermediate. In summary the integration of circular economy principles and carbon neutrality objectives into algae cultivation and harvesting could create a more sustainable and environmental friendly approach to algae based biofuel production Choudhary et al. 2022 . This approach aligns with the broader goal of mitigating climate change and achieving a more sustainable and circular bioeconomy Sani et al. 2023 . This article attempts to discuss the most recent research and development in the production of algae-based biofuels. In addition this article dis- cusses algae cultivation techniques factors influencing algae growth harvesting and algae-based biofuel production processes. Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 3 S. Tomar et al. 2. Algae Algae are a diverse category of heterotrophic and photosynthetic entities from various phylogenetic groups classified as macroal- gae Syrpas and Venskutonis 2020 Chen et al. 2022 . They are superior in terms of productivity and photosynthetic efficiencies and not require as much land as compared to higher land-based plants Shobana et al. 2017 . In addition algae can transform atmos- pheric CO2 into compounds such as lipids carbohydrates proteins etc Kavitha et al. 2017 . Due to shorter doubling time 2 5 days and simple growth requirements in comparison to other feedstock sources algae are preferred to be used as the substrate for the pro- duction of biofuel biohydrogen and biodiesel Suganya et al. 2016 . 2.1. Microalgae Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms inability freshwater or saline environment Shetty et al. 2019 . In the exponential phase microalgae can double in number in as few as 3.5 h and typically do so within 24 h Vassilev and Vassileva 2016 . Microalgae are mainly composed of lipids 5 60 carbohydrates 8 30 and protein 40 60 Kumar et al. 2022 . Further- more some additional compounds such as fatty acids pigments antioxidants and vitamins Suganya et al. 2016 . In addition they produce other high-value chemicals such as fatty acids phycobilin pigments docosahexaenoic acid astaxanthin and ꞵ-carotene Shi et al. 2022 . 2.2. Cyanobacteria Cyanobacteria are common members of freshwater brackish and marine plankton worldwide. Cyanobacteria are commonly found on rocks and soil and in a symbiotic relationship with fungi and plants. At the subcellular level cyanobacteria have a simple structure that doesn t have a nucleus Kaviya et al. 2019 . Cyanobacteria contain photosynthetic apparatus which helps them to per- form photosynthesis in higher plants and algae. Still in cyanobacteria the chloroplast is absent due to which these reactions occur in latter organisms Singh 2018 . Unicellular and filamentous forms are primarily found in cyanobacteria. Both morphotypes can pro- duce structures visible to the naked eye such as spherical irregular colonies e.g. microcystins larger or pinheads and bundles of filaments like sawdust in size and shape. Commonly cyanobacteria are classified as algae known as blue-green algae a distinct group of bacteria that can perform photosynthesis. The nutrients and sunlight are changed by cyanobacteria into energy for reproduction and growth Chittora et al. 2020 . 2.3. Macroalgae Macroalgae called seaweed are multicellular macroscopic marine algae living near the seabed Pereira 2021 . Seaweed may be- long to the group of multicellular algae-brown algae green algae and red algae. These three groups of algae are not thought to have a common ancestor. Macroalgae contains an algal body known as the thallus stem-like structure stipe basal-type structure holofast finger-like extension of holofast known as haptera Suganya et al. 2016 . The biochemical composition of the macroalgae in terms of lipids and carbohydrates content is depicted in Table 1 Becker 1994 Kaliaperumal et al. 2002 . 3. Algae as a biofuel precursor Algae is being used to produce numerous biofuels such as biohydrogen biodiesel bioethanol biomethane and biobutanol Abomohra and Elshobary 2019 . Various thermochemical processes have also been devised to produce biofuels using various bio- mass conversion technologies. Among them the process of pyrolysis is simple practical and inexpensive and it may be used with a wide range of feedstocks Escalante et al. 2022 . Biofuels obtained from algae have the efficiency to replace fossil fuels as they are carbon neutral and thus have the potential to avoid energy security concerns and climate change. Many countries have launched programs policies pertaining to promotion of Biofuel production and utilization Ref. Table 2 . 3.1. Biodiesel Production of biodiesel from algae promises sustainable energy due to their fast growth rate and capability to be cultivated in freshwater seawater and wastewater shown in Fig. 1. The entire cycle of algae is completed via photosynthetic reactions that change light energy into renewable energy Peter et al. 2022 . Biodiesel is a renewable non-toxic biodegradable diesel and a long-chain fatty acid alkyl ester mixture. Biodiesel could be used alone or in blended form with petroleum diesel. Utilizing biodiesel as a fuel sub- stitute can help reduce reliance on petroleum-based fuels and enhance environmental quality in broad Noor et al. 2018 . Primary four techniques have been reported for biodiesel production direct use by blending raw oils thermal cracking micro-emulsions and transesterification Chew et al. 2018 . The transesterification process converts lipids into non-toxic biodegradable and renewable Table 1 Macroalge biochemical composition based on dry weight biomass Becker 1994 Kaliaperumal et al. 2002 .

Biodiesel and biogas production from microalgae cultivated on waste water in closed Photo-Bioreactor. biodiesel. An enzymatic catalyst either acidic or basic is used in the in-situ transesterification process. The acid reaction effectively changes free fatty acids and triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters FAME . Acid catalyst gives a high yield in FAME up to 99 of conversion Dehiba et al. 2017 . Biodiesel production from microalgae has been suggested to be much more sustainable and feasible Dickinson et al. 2017 . The process of biodiesel production will be of great importance to developing countries in particular due to its eco-friendly easy operation cost-effectiveness and potential to replace conventional fuel resources. Also algal biomass doesn t re- quire land for cultivation and is free from lignin Tomar et al. 2021 . The sufficient lipid content in microalgae proved it more suit- able for biodiesel production. Other products produced simultaneously during large-scale microalgae cultivation have various phar- maceutical and food industry applications besides lipid production. The simultaneous production of other economic products makes the process more cost-effective. Ağbulut et al. 2023 analyzed the microalgae bio-oil production using pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction and suggested that microalgae bio-oil could become a promising alternative fuel for transportation and power genera- tion. Ahmad et al. 2022 reviewed the recent biomolecular and biotechnological approaches to increase lipid and carotenoid produc- tion from microalgae Ahmad et al. 2022 . The lipid production from microalgae is affected by various factors like nutrient availabil- ity light intensity temperature retention time and algal strain type Kothari et al. 2023 . Maintaining these factors at their optimum levels increases the cultivation cost thus making the process of biofuel production from microalgae economically non-viable. The au- thors suggested an integrated approach including wastewater treatment by algal biomass harvesting and producing bioactive com- Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 6 S. Tomar et al. pounds and biofuels from algal waste for feasible economic and sustainable biofuel production and other future applications Kothari et al. 2023 . Even though genetically modified microalgae strains have shown considerable potential for enhanced lipid and other value added product production it is dangerous to commercialise them for industrial uses. Beacham et al. 2017 advocate that pru- dence and common sense should be applied while cultivating large-scale genetically modified algal strains. The cultivation facility should be contained to restrict the release of strains into the environment. 3.2. Biohydrogen Biohydrogen is a promising and attractive alternative energy source as it can be easily generated. It is considered a zero-emission fuel much cleaner than all other fuels Singh et al. 2022 . Biohydrogen carries energy that can be used to replace gasoline in vehi- cles. Biohydrogen advantages include its high energy content and water vapour as the only by-product of combustion. It could gener- ate electricity in fuel cells by utilizing algal biomass and organic waste as feedstock Lee 2016 . Hydrogen production s conventional physical and chemical processes are energy intensive and unsustainable whereas biological production methods are sustainable clean and less energy-intensive Boboescu et al. 2016 . Furthermore Biological hydrogen processes may utilize variety of the sub- strates and have high conversion efficiency Rai et al. 2011 Goria et al. 2023 did the SWOT analysis of biohydrogen production from algal biomass. Excellent waste valorization and carbon capture are the strengths. Low biohydrogen yield and expensive startup costs are weaknesses. Algal biohydrogen can be improved by adopting environmental metabolic or genetic changes. The risk is that the technology still lacks credibility even with the suggested modifications Goria et al. 2023 . 3.3. Bioethanol Ethanol is the most common biofuel that can be produced from algal biomass da Maia et al. 2020 . Algae contains proteins car- bohydrates lipids and other valuable compounds. The carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch can be converted into bioethanol by fermentation. Microalgae utilization as a starch source for bioethanol production overcomes various limitations associated with the conventional starch source Özçimen et al. 2020 . Ethanol from algal biomass has several advantages -arable land is not used in this and thus CO2 emission to the environment is low da Maia et al. 2020 . Moreover high octane numbers prevent the engine from knocking Maity and Mallick 2022 . 3.4. Biobutanol Biobutanol is preferred as one of the most promising biofuels because of its energy density. The fermentation process can produce biobutanol but it has less efficiency in products because of the inhibitory effects of some compounds Onay 2022 . Plants and their waste can also produce it. However these feedstocks have limitations because of their low growth rate and efficiency of products for production. Because of these advantages researchers focus on algae for biobutanol production Onay 2022 . The use of algae can re- duce agricultural land usage and no fuel and food conflict exit. Moreover for growth algae can utilize inorganic carbon from the at- mosphere and could produce clean energy Shanmugam et al. 2021 . Biobutanol has several advantages over ethanol including low water solubility and conventional in engines without any modifications Onay 2022 . Biobutanol is safe and more convenient for pipeline transportation because it possesses low hygroscopicity is less corrosive and has low volatility than ethanol thus it is consid- ered an ideal biofuel Lee et al. 2020 Ashani et al. 2020 . 4. Algae cultivation techniques Algal biomass can generate biofuels such as biodiesel biohydrogen and biogas because it grows faster doesn t compete with agri- cultural land for its growth and converts sunlight into chemical energy by consuming CO2 Ramaraj et al. 2016 . The consumption of wastewater as a medium for algae cultivation has several benefits including nutrient removal 80 100 heavy metal removal 80 100 carbon sequestration from the atmosphere 1.83 kg CO2 kg 1 biomass and high biomass generation for biofuel produc- tion 40 50 higher than crops feedstock Shahid et al. 2020 . In general algae are cultivated in either the open pond system or in a closed Photo-bioreactor PBR and in facilities that process wastewater for the purpose of producing biofuel. Due to superior control over the environment and other factors influencing the growth of algae PBRs are thought to be more effective in the cultivation of biomass and the treatment of wastewater Yaqoubnejad et al. 2021 . 4.1. Open pond system The open pond system cultivation is the most commercially explored due to its low operational cost. Closed photo-bioreactors may have higher photosynthetic efficiency and biomass yield than open ponds Pires et al. 2017 . The aspects imperative to consider while selecting the open pond system are energy cost of land water nutrients the biology of the algae and local climatic conditions and final product. The open pond system is the primary system used to produce microalgae on the commercial level and in waste- water systems. Open pond culture systems can be elaborate as an inclined system mixed ponds shallow lagoons ponds raceway ponds and circular central-pivot ponds. Since the open pond cultivation system utilizes sunlight as a primary source and mixing the cultivation medium is less energy intensive and has a high surface area for gaseous exchange the operation of the open pond system is comparatively low Jerney and Spilling 2020 . 4.2. Shallow lagoons and ponds For thousands of years ponds lagoons and ditches have been utilized as primitive systems for wastewater treatment. Simple ponds of various shapes and sizes commonly enriched with manure produce algal biomass Borowitzka and Moheimani 2012 . Al- Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 7 S. Tomar et al. gal biomass for humans has been produced using some natural algae growing methods. Spirulina Arthrospira was once extracted from natural lakes by the Aztecs García et al. 2017 . The two Dunaliella salina β-cartone plants at Whyalla South Australia and Hutt Lagoon Western Australia are currently operated by BASF Baden Aniline and Soda Factory . They are the world s largest commer- cial microalgae production plants. Each of these plants has a total pond area of around 700 ha. The advantage of shallow lagoon ponds is that the unialgal culture can be maintained because the algae are grown in very high salt concentrations Borowitzka and Moheimani 2012 . Based on the pond area productivity is low and due to its utilization efficiency and cheap harvesting process this is the world s cheapest algae production system Suparmaniam et al. 2019 . 4.3. Inclined cascade system In cascade system ponds algae culture flows down in cascade surface and is collected then pushed back up to the top of the in- cline. Setlík and co-workers 1960s developed the patented inclined system at Trebon in the Czech Republic Setllk 1970 . In this set-up during the day culture is circulated from the bottom of the slope to the top and at night it is stored in a huge tank. This process reduces the culture s total pumping cost and overnight cooling. In Bulgaria 3000 m2 plants with sloping ponds have been constructed Becker 1994 . The ponds are constructed of concrete and covered with iron grids producing turbulence. This technique has the advantage of removing moisture and thermal instability while also achieving high algal biomass and making harvesting easier Xu et al. 2020 . 4.4. Circular central-pivot ponds Circular ponds are the oldest used for cultivating algae commercially in Indonesia Japan and Taiwan Tan et al. 2020 . These ponds are constructed from concrete and mixed by a rotating arm placed in the pond s core with up to 0.5ha in capacity and 50m in diameter. In circular ponds the arm travels a much larger distance so the mixing at the periphery of ponds is much more significant Borowitzka and Moheimani 2012 . 4.5. Mixed ponds Mixed ponds are most widely used for algae production for aquaculture feed Zhu et al. 2022 . These ponds are approximately 50 80 cm deep with an aeration facility. Productivities are low due to the uneven mixing depth of the ponds Koley et al. 2019 . There is an alternative mixing method for regular ponds i.e. drag boards. The drag boards connected with electric motors are pulled from one end of the pond to the other forcing the water to flow and create a turbulent back-whirl. In this system less power is used but productivity is low because of irregular mixing and depth of the ponds Borowitzka and Moheimani 2012 . 4.6. Raceways ponds Raceway ponds are mainly used to cultivate microalgae at a commercial level and treat wastewater. Although polyvinyl chloride PVC liners have also been utilized geotextile liners High Density Polyethylene HDPE and other types of plastic are typically used to line raceway ponds used for commercial algae production. These liners have a life of at least 20 years only when carefully and cor- rectly laid and the choice of liner material is correct. Raceway ponds can be built into the ground with sloping side walls and lined or they can be built on top of the ground with pond walls made of concrete blocks or pre-formed concrete set-up. The cost of pond liners is very high and cheaper alternatives must be explored to lower the construction cost. Rubber asphalt and other elastomeric materi- als have been employed in cold-applied two-component and hot-applied systems both with and without reinforcing fabrics Dodd 2017 . This still hasn t shown to be as reliable and efficient as membrane pond liners. The pond culture must be circulated at around 20 30 cm S 1 to maintain the algae afloat give easily uniform illumination and minimise thermal stratification. Various systems have been tested in the raceway pond for rotating and mixing the algal culture. Propellers Archimedes screws Airlifts Pumps im- pellers Paddlewheel and water jets are a few examples Borowitzka and Moheimani 2012 . 4.7. Closed systems Algae are grown in a closed environment with this method and any required controls can be applied to the physical conditions. This system comprises a Photobioreactor PBRs i.e. Horizontal tube photo-bioreactor Flat panel photo-bioreactor Stirred tank photo-bioreactor and Vertical tube photo-bioreactor. 4.7.1. Vertical tube PBRs In vertical tubular PBRs microalgae productivity depends on the location species grown biomass concentration tube diameter the distance between the tube and the number of horizontal tubes per stack vertically stacked system Sirohi et al. 2022 . Dynamic sunlight patterns across the year and growth characteristics of algae and reactor dimensions are used as the model in this type of photo-bioreactors. In this system the performance can be improved by using light-reflecting materials on the ground surface. The air- lift column and bubble column are the vertical tube PBRs with an air sparger at the bottom of the reactor that improves mass transfer by creating air bubbles for proper mixing Alhaboubi 2021 . The bubble column reactor has no internal structure and the fluid pat- tern is mainly managed by the bubble of air produced. The height of this PBRs is twice its diameter and light is externally supplied. The photosynthetic efficiency and mixing of algal cells by the light flash effect enhances the mobility of algal cells. With this config- uration the gas flow rate is critical to control as it affects the dark and light cycle Ting et al. 2017 . The Airlift reactor is the modified bubble column design considered cost-effective for various types of microalgae cultivation. The advantage of this photo-bioreactor is efficient mass transfer ideal for algae immobilization and suitable for mixing with low shear stress Ting et al. 2017 . Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 8 S. Tomar et al. 4.7.2. Horizontal tube PBRs This type of PBRs was the first closed reactor for microalgae cultivation and is also known as the tubular reactor. The reactor can be fitted into place in a variety of ways to create walls helices and panels to prevent light from a light source from diffusing into the culture medium tube diameter. In this design the tube diameter can be reduced due to the complication of a light source in the cul- ture medium. Within the tubes the culture medium is circulated with exposure to the light source and a compressor pump recovers. Maintaining the high turbulent flow regime in the reactor is essential to avoid microalgae flocculation Huang et al. 2016 . 4.7.3. Stirred tank PBRs Stirred tank photo-bioreactor used for producing microalgae is based on the fermentation tank design except that microalgae cul- tivation requires an additional external light source. Agitator s mechanical movement promotes the mixing of the culture media while ensuring mass transfer and optimal heat Klinthong et al. 2015 . Stirred tanks perform well in indoor cultivation because they enable efficient mixing and transfer with the addition of aeration potentially increasing the solubility of gas Chew et al. 2018 . Due to problems with illumination stirred tank photo-bioreactors can only be used at small laboratory scales. The main objective of develop- ing a Continuous stirred tank reactor was to enhance algal biomass productivity. 4.7.4. Flat panel photo-bioreactor FPPBR The flat panel photo-bioreactor consists of two transparent or semi-transparent glass sheets assembled in a rectangular box and connected in a cascade towards the light source. They can be placed vertically or at an angle to obtain high light from the sun or other light sources Chew et al. 2018 . The FPPBR have a short light path facilitating efficient light penetration to the microalgae thus be- ing suitable for outdoor and indoor cultivation. The fitted air sparger produces air bubbles. Enhancing the mixing rate and providing sufficient amounts of CO2while releasing the oxygen as exhaust gas to enhance the flashing light effect could potentially enhance mi- croalgae biomass productivity Chew et al. 2018 . However this design has a few limitations such as aeration which generates hy- drodynamic stress and biofouling near the surface Ting et al. 2017 . Potential risks include aeration-caused high-stress damage and biomass adhesion to the bioreactor s walls. Another difficulty is controlling the temperature inside the flat panel photo-bioreactor however sprinklers or heat exchangers can do this. 4.8. Economic cultivation of algae in wastewater Biofuel based on algal biomass is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. The major obstacles to algae based biofuel are biomass harvesting and cultivation of water and carbon sources from the liquid medium Ummalyma et al. 2021 . Cultivating algae on waste- water in the presence of sunlight by capturing atmospheric CO2 from the atmosphere for biofuel production is a novel and cost- effective method for generating alternative energy Rai et al. 2020 . For biofuel production algae gain an interest in nutrient recov- ery wastewater treatment and renewable energy generation Li et al. 2022 . The algae s ability to fix CO2 and produce high-value- added products makes algal wastewater treatment economically feasible Bashir et al. 2022 . Wastewater is the end product of mu- nicipal agricultural industrial and domestic sources Chakraborty et al. 2023 . Generally inorganic content like calcium sodium magnesium potassium phosphate bicarbonate sulfur heavy metals and ammonium salts and organic mass like proteins volatile acids carbohydrates and lipids are present in wastewater P. Singh et al. 2016 . Wastewater composition is a reflection of the tech- nology used and the way of life in the producing society Abily et al. 2023 . Wastewater composition is variable-phosphorus and ni- trogen concentration vary from one water source to another and even seasonally and daily for a single source. Wastewater from mu- nicipal has a lower concentration of total phosphorus TP 5 20 mg L 1 and total nitrogen TN 15 90 mg L 1 than wastewater pro- duced from animals Chawla et al. 2020 . The concentrations of the nutrients in agricultural wastewater also vary by source. The TP varies from 30 mg L 1 dairy to 987 mg L 1 swine and TN varies from 185 mg L 1 in dairy to 3213 mg L 1 in swine . In the in- dustrial wastewater the lowest concentration 1.1 mg L 1 for TN and 0.6 mg L 1 for TP was observed in the paper mill Chawla et al. 2022 . Macronutrients such as phosphorus nitrogen and carbon are required to grow algae Khan et al. 2018 . The ratio of C N P is the primary factor that determines the availability of nutrients in wastewater and directly affects the survivability chemical com- position biomass productivity and nutrient removal of the algal cultures AlMomani and Örmeci 2016 Orefice et al. 2019 Znad et al. 2018 . In wastewater carbon and ammonium are essential to promote algae growth and phosphorus plays a crucial role in the en- ergy metabolism of the algae. For simultaneous utilization of phosphorus and nitrogen the ratio of N P must be in the proper range Chawla et al. 2020 . Algae utilizes micronutrients like silicon and iron and some micronutrients are toxic to the algal species if the concentration of these is too high. Although there are several strains of algal species which can tolerate heavy metals and helps to ab- sorb these metals from the environment Chawla et al. 2022 . Some species of algae remove pollutants such as mercury cadmium and organic chemicals from industrial wastewater thus enhancing the algal growth rate S. Khan et al. 2022 . The treatment of wastewater involves the removal of phosphorus organic carbon nitrogen heavy metals and other contaminants using chemical physical and biological processes Liu et al. 2020 . Treatment of wastewater by conventional processes requires a large amount of aeration in bacterial oxidation of organic carbon and biological nitrogen removal in the nitrification stage. During nitrification vast amounts of greenhouse gases N2O are released Campos et al. 2016 . In contrast wastewater treatment with algae has been consid- ered an environmentally friendly approach Priyadharshini et al. 2021 . Treating wastewater using algae is a feasible and cost- effective method for CO2 bio-fixation Almomani et al. 2019 . The main advantage of using algae in wastewater treatment is the O2 generation by photosynthesis. Microalgae can utilize both inorganic nitrogen Ammonium Ammonia and organic nitrogen urea as well as nitrates and nitrites Ross et al. 2018 . NO2 emission in the wastewater treatment process is a consequence of the environmen- tal conditions under which nitrogen removal occurs Arun et al. 2020 . Microalgae directly assimilate PO4 and NH3 and helps in the metabolic function and growth of the cell Borowitzka et al. 2016 . Autotrophic growth of microalgae utilizes inorganic carbon in the Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 9 S. Tomar et al. form of dissolved CO2 in the bicarbonate-carbonate buffer system Arana and Gude 2018 . The efficiency of CO2 fixation when in- jected continuously in the culture of microalgae was in a range of 16 64 at an input CO2 concentration of 1 15 for Chlorella sp. Hajinajaf et al. 2022 and 4 66 at an input CO2 concentration of 6 15 for Scenedesmus sp. Nayak et al. 2016 . Table 3 shows the wastewater generation volume and wastewater nutrients available in different countries that could be used to cultivate algae for bio- fuel production. 5. Factor affecting algae growth 5.1. Temperature The metabolic process within the cell and the supply of physicochemical carbon dioxide to the cell are both affected by tempera- ture Ördög et al. 2016 . Temperature plays a vital role in algae growth thus crucial to keep the temperature under control Paliwal et al. 2017 . Microalgae s gross photosynthetic activity is affected by temperature because they undergo cellular division which in- fluences their biomass productivity. Cell division takes place because of enzymatic activity related to the Calvin cycle. The Arrhenius equation is the most often used expression for connecting growth rate to temperature. According to the Arrhenius equation growth doubles as the temperature increases until an optimum temperature is achieved Ahmad et al. 2020 . Heat stress causes the inactiva- tion of enzymes and denaturation of a protein involved in photosynthesis causing a slowdown of algae growth Dalby et al. 2021 . Three Dunaliella salina strains are isolated from 60 saline soil samples and were reported to grow rapidly at 22 °C Wu et al. 2016 . It was found that Dunaliella has the ability to grow in the temperature range between 0 °C and 45 °C. Still the optimal growth tempera- ture for Dunaliella sp. was reported to be 32 °C with a temperature range of 25 °C 35 °C Wu et al. 2016 . 5.2. pH In algae growth one of the basic parameters is pH which affects cell metabolism and biomass production. The majority of algal species are known to survive at neutral pH. However all algal strains are believed to have a limited pH and optimum range for their growth Gatamaneni et al. 2018 . Algae sequester CO2 during photosynthesis and at ideal pH the bicarbonate in the medium is changed to CO2 by the activity of the algae enzyme carbonic anhydrase which results in the removal of hydroxyl ions which raises the pH Beigbeder et al. 2021 . Since the thylakoid and chloroplast have a vital role in photosynthesis their function is limited to a specific ray of pH. Therefore the culture medium should have a particular pH range. The availability of nutrients such as organic acids and iron is also affected by pH Robles-Aguilar et al. 2019 . Because carbonate equilibrium controls pH it is regarded as a cru- cial environmental component in both seas and inland water. It was found that at acidic pH 3.0-6.2 and alkaline pH 8.3-9.0 pH the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris grow slower. When the pH was between 7.5 and 8.0 optimum growth was achieved Gerardi 2015 . The optimal pH for the growth of Spirulina platensis was reported in a range pH 7.0 and 9.0. The microalgae s highest growth rate was reported at pH 8.0 indicating that moderate alkalinity was required for optimal growth Gatamaneni et al. 2018 . At a pH 7.0 the microalgae seemed to have the highest biomass productivity Fagiri et al. 2013 Ren 2014 . The Dunaliella salina maximum growth Table 3 Wastewater generation volume and wastewater nutrients available in different countries.

Tomar et al. was reported at pH 9.18 Abu-Rezq et al. 2010 . The D. baradawil and C. ellipsoides are said to have optimal growth in the pH 7.5 and 10.0 respectively. At pH 10.0 the growth of Chlorella ellipsoidea and Dunaliella bardawil was inhibited because carbonate ions are absent that are an essential source of inorganic carbon Chen et al. 2020 . 5.3. Nutrients The growth of algae is directly proportional to the rate of consumption of nutrients where the most limiting nutrients are ab- sorbed as described by the equation given by Michaelis Menten μ μmax S S + K Where μ is the growth rate μ max is the maximum growth rate S is the concentration of limiting nutrients and the concentration lead- ing to a half-maximal growth rate is described by K also known as the half-saturation constant Yang et al. 2016 . Elements phospho- rus is a component of phospholipids while nitrogen is the building block of nucleic acids and proteins. When these macronutrients are insufficient metabolic pathways usually change Romero-Rodríguez et al. 2018 . Phosphorus is considered the limiting compo- nent when the N P ratio of N P exceeds 16 Juneja et al. 2013 and the nitrogen concentration must be regulated to maximize mi- croalgae growth. Therefore phosphorus in optimal quantity is considered beneficial for microalgae growth. Microalgae cannot sur- vive in phosphorus concentrations below 0.045 mg L 1 or above 1.65 mg L 1. When the content of phosphorus is equal to 0.02 mg L 1 growth is promoted Juneja et al. 2013 . The study on Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis oculata suggested that lipid synthesis increased when nitrogen availability was reduced but there was no influence on microalgae growth patterns Church et al. 2017 . In the Calvin cycle the microbial cell converts inorganic carbon into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate Paes et al. 2016 . The car- bon and nitrogen internal ratio regulates when metabolism shifts towards functioning molecules because of the high photosynthetic rate the inner carbon exceeds the C N ratio in the initial stages of growth resulting in protein synthesis. However as the organism grows the N2 present in the liquid medium start depleting and the production shifts from proteins to lipids Gao et al. 2022 . Cop- per Manganese zinc cobalt iron and nickel are critical metals that are required by algae for their metabolic processes. Algal growth may be restricted if they are not present Concas et al. 2016 . Adding trace elements such as Fe3+ Zn2+ Mn2+ Cu2+ Co2+ and EDTA increase the growth of Nannochloropsis oculata. Increased concentrations of the trace elements increase the photosynthetic ac- tivity of the algae by rising CO2 levels. This shows that trace elements have a strong influence on fatty acid composition and also on lipid productivity Sun and Huang 2017 . 5.4. Type of reactors used for algae cultivation The most challenging aspects of commercial microalgae production for designing is an efficient reactor cultivation processes and finding algal strains capable of capturing a significant amount of solar carbon dioxide and solar energy. No the best reactor system which can be identified as one that can give a maximum output with low input exists despite several attempts. The situation will de- cide the optimum culture method because the types of algae that are available and the end aim are important factors. The essential el- ements that can influence the flow rate of the liquid-liquid phase in microreactors are channel size mixer type reaction temperature and internal configuration reaction time. The improved reactor technology for large-scale production has limitations by microreac- tors and has practical implications Dou et al. 2013 . The reactor s design includes flat plate reactors fermenter-type reactors tubular reactors and processing parameters covering gaseous transfer light requirements and medium mixing Gopi et al. 2022 . Light pene- tration is the main factor influencing the reactor s design which requires a high surface-to-volume ratio. This penetration is essential if one desires to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis which is required for increased product and biomass productivity. Several shapes have been developed and examined to attain the desired high surface-to-volume ratio. Fermenter-type flat plate and tubular shapes are three fundamental varieties the tubular and flat plate is specifically designed for efficient sunlight harvesting whereas the fermenter type requires artificial illumination. Flat plate and tubular reactors are the most popular choices Skjånes et al. 2016 . Table 4 describes the limitations and advantages of Photo-bioreactors for algae cultivation. 6. Strategies to enhance lipid carbohydrate content 6.1. Stress Microalgae lipid production requires appropriate pH temperature nutrients and light. Furthermore the mentioned environmen- tal factors are often unsuitable for optimal growth conditions for algal growth. However increasing their content can enhance bio- chemical compositions like carbohydrates and lipids under temperature light salinity and nutrition stress conditions Jaiswal et al. 2020 . During stress conditions microalgae can overproduce lipids or carotenoids Suganya et al. 2016 Jaiswal et al. 2020 . Under high salinity stress lipid accumulation increased to 70 in Dunaliella sp. and 21.1 in Chlorella vulgaris sp. Zhu et al. 2016 . 6.1.1. Salinity stress Salinity plays a significant role in biochemical and physiological processes for microalgal development fatty acid metabolism and reproduction. Hence salinity stress is one of the most effective lipid enrichment techniques Alishah Aratboni et al. 2019 . The os- motic pressure within microalgal cells is known to change due to this form of anxiety triggering a stress response that enables mi- croalgae metabolism to adjust to the new environment Alishah Aratboni et al. 2019 . Salinity has a significant effect on several bio- fuel products. A high salinity environment has increased bioethanol production from Spirulina maxima. Several species of microalgae synthesize low molecular weight carbohydrates under salt stress. The salinity stress also affects the accumulation of lipids in microal- gae cells Table 5 . In Dunaliella tertiolecta the lipid composition is improved by 60 70 with increased salinity Jaiswal et al. 2020 . Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 11 S. Tomar et al. Table 4 Advantage and limitations of closed Photo-bioreactors for algae cultivation Klinthong et al. 2015 . Type of photobioreactor Advantages Limitations Flat panel Illumination surface area is high. Biomass productivity is high. Accumulation of dissolved oxygen is low. Cost-effective construction and operation. Requires many support material for scale-up process. Algal wall adhesion may occur. Due to aeration high stress damage. Controlling culture temperature is difficult. Bubble column low physical stress to algal cell. High mass transfer due to the sparging Penetration and light scattering promotes by bubble. Sedimentation of algal cell. Random movement is frequent in the culture. Airlift column High biomass concentration and areal production. Utilization and light penetration is high Cost effective Utilization of CO2 efficiency is high. Difficulty in scale-up process. Reduce working volume by oxygen removal capability of air lift process. Insufficient turbulence produce during airlift Operation. Tubular Algae circulation using a pump or air lift technology. Effective temperature monitoring is possible. Installing internal mixers can enhance mass transmission. Scaling up is difficult. Accumulation of oxygen cause by long tube. Inadequate CO2 fixation could lead to acidification. Stirred tank Good mixing and External light source. Gas solubility can lead to better aeration. Large-scale design is challenging. Light penetration in large scale is insufficient. Table 5 Carbohydrate content of algal species and bioethanol yield obtained during bioethanol production. Algae Carbohydrate content Bioethanol yield References Chlorella vulgaris 55.0 40.00 Brennan and Owende 2010 Lee et al. 2011 Chlorococum sp. 32.5 38.30 Harun et al. 2010 Ike et al. 1997 Chlamydomonasreinhardtii UTEX 90 60.0 29.10 Hirano et al. 1997 Nguyen et al. 2009 Tetraselmissuecica 26.0 7.26 Ho et al. 2013 Brown et al. 1998 Similarly increasing salinity stimulates the formation of saturated fatty acid which will increase the efficiency of biodiesel B. R. Kumar et al. 2019 . 6.1.2. Heavy metal stress Heavy metal supplementation in microalgae cells may increase carbohydrate and lipid accumulation Jaiswal et al. 2020 . Heavy metals such as zinc Manganese copper nickel and iron are essential micronutrients for the biological process as they contribute vita- min precursors catalytic co-factors of several metalloenzymes and structural cell membrane proteins Alishah Aratboni et al. 2019 . For example in Agmenellum quadruplicatum glucose concentration increased from 5 to 45 during the Fe2+stress environment while in Chlorella vulgaris the lipid composition increased by 7-fold during the Fe2+stress environment Jaiswal et al. 2020 . In many di- atom species e.g. Cyclotellacryptica Naviculaseprophila and Chaetocerosmuelleri the stress of the silicon have the ability to increase the lipid content Griffiths and Harrison 2009 . Furthermore nutritional trace metals e.g. Mo Mg Zn Ni and Fe are required to produce nitrogen-catalyzed biohydrogen Zhu et al. 2016 . 6.2. Genetic engineering A genetic engineering approach is one of the best methods to genetically modify microalgae to increase the productivity of lipids shown in Fig. 2. Genetic engineering techniques are attracting more attention from researchers since they are thought to be unique and almost untunable tools V. Singh et al. 2016 Lenka et al. 2016 . Genetic engineering can inhibit express or decrease one or more genes involved in producing the desired metabolite. The genes concerned with photosynthesis growth rate and enhanced resis- tivity to harsh environments such as temperature salinity and pH in microalgae as well as genes involved in lipid metabolism Song et al. 2015 . By analysing the molecular tools available for the genetic engineering of microalgae it may be possible to increase prod- uct yields and produce new microalgal bioproducts rapidly for commercial use Dickinson et al. 2017 . Various methods of bioengi- neering can be applied for the genetic modification CRISPR Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat associated with protein 9 random mutagenesis ZFN Zinc finger repeat mainly used for alteration of the gene sequence Dickinson et al. 2017 Sproles et al. 2021 . For the repression and activation of gene expression miRNA micro RNA and siRNA short interfering RNA are used Yao et al. 2016 . Working with genetically modified algae has a number of drawbacks including environmental consequences and ethical concerns about its release into the environment. It is important to note that the release of genetically modified algae into the natural habitat must be investigated appropriately and approved by various international expert committees because in the event of an error or consensual release of GM genetically modified microalgae these types of microalgae can not only survive but also re- produce and spread further in the natural habitat Huang et al. 2016 . Table 6 describes the target of genetic manipulation and its impact on lipid production. Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 12 S. Tomar et al. Fig. 2.

Co-metabolism Co-metabolism has been intensively studied to find the limitations in substrate utilization by individual strains to produce addi- tional byproducts Magdouli et al. 2016 . More research is currently being carried out on the interactions between different varieties of algae whether they are beneficial or antagonistic mutualistic or symbiotic. Furthermore microbial consortia could accomplish more complex tasks than monocultures and perform impossible functions for individual strains or species to perform Bhatt et al. 2021 . The co-metabolism method provides a competent and safer alternative for reducing the cost of raw materials for biodiesel pro- duction. Monoraphidium sp. FXY-10 and Chlorella sp. U4341 two potential biodiesel feedstocks were recently identified Bogen et al. 2013 . As mentioned earlier it is reported to enhance lipid productivity 20-fold in co-metabolism. The goal was to release lipids with minimal energy consumption while remaining feasible for the regrowth of high-value products during lipid extraction Menegazzo and Fonseca 2019 . Up to 50 of the total cost of producing biodiesel falls into harvesting Wrede et al. 2014 . Bacterial bio- flocculants isolated from bacterial species could be used as flocculating agents for algae such as Scenedesmus spp. and Solibacillus sil- vestris Powell and Hill 2013 Wan et al. 2013 . Filamentous fungi are also known to be an attractive bio-flocculating agents Magdouli et al. 2016 . Moreover the increasing cost of organic CO2 and the requirement for process control significantly affect oil formation in algae species. As a result the co-metabolism method has been solely tested to reduce operating costs. In a study for lipid Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 13 S. Tomar et al. production various culture methods were investigated. The co-metabolism of Chlorella sp. U4341 and Monoraphidium sp. FXY-10 pro- duced 93.4 - 223.42 and 21.23 gm 3d 1 of lipid productivity under heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. However the lipid pro- ductivity was around 29.52gm-3 d 1 in photoautotrophic states Zhao et al. 2014 . 7. Technique for algal biomass harvesting Harvesting algae is a two-step process that includes bulk harvesting and thickening. The first step bulk harvesting is intended to separate the biomass from the suspension in the bulk and the technologies employed are flocculation flotation or gravity sedimenta- tion. The second step thickening concentrates the slurry employing methods like centrifugation filtration and ultrasonic aggrega- tion. However algae biofuel production s most challenging part is harvesting using cost-effective methods Yin et al. 2020 . Algae are harvested using centrifugation gravity sedimentation micro straining flocculation floatation filtering and occasionally a combina- tion of one or two methods. Flocculation is good efficient and economical for harvesting a large number of algal species Chutia et al. 2017 Rakesh et al. 2020 . 7.1. Centrifugation The ideal process for microalgae harvesting is centrifugation because it can remove particles from algal suspension without using any additive agents Rakesh et al. 2020 . Immense shear pressures are applied during centrifugation causing the algal cells to lyse and release algal oil into the media. After that the oil recovery was done. Pahl et al. 2013 investigated several centrifuges including hydro cyclones perforated and imperforated basket centrifuges decanters and disc stack centrifuges for biomass separation. Disc stack centrifuge is used to recover high-value industrial algal products however they have a low energy return since more energy is lost than is recovered Najjar and Abu-Shamleh 2020 . Decanter centrifuges are very efficient but consume a lot of energy. In con- trast hydro cyclone centrifuges require less maintenance but are unsuitable for large-scale applications because of their high produc- tion cost and energy Rakesh et al. 2020 . While considering centrifugation as harvesting technique one should consider factors such as the specific microalgal species the scale of cultivation the required biomass concentration and the available resources. Centrifu- gation is particularly well-suited for applications where efficiency speed and high biomass recovery are crucial such as large-scale industrial production or research requiring concentrated microalgal biomass. However it may not be the most cost-effective or en- ergy-efficient option for all situations and alternative harvesting techniques should be evaluated based on the specific needs of the project or process. 7.2. Sedimentation Despite its rudimentary character sedimentation is effective for a different types of microalgae and is quite energy efficient Mathimani and Mallick 2018 . Therefore gravity sedimentation should be used to harvest microalgae for low-value end products like biofuels Muylaert et al. 2017 . However this method s reliability could be higher because microalgal density is essential for process efficiency. The sedimentation rate of microalgae is 0.1 2.6cm h 1 which is a prolonged process due to this biomass deterio- rates restricting its routine biomass Iasimone 2018 . To increase microalgal settling a coagulation flocculation step is often used before gravity sedimentation. Because of microalgal auto-flocculation the best results for harvesting microalgae utilizing gravity sed- imentation were obtained using lamella-type separators total suspended solid recovery is 1.6 Kumar et al. 2023 . Although sedi- mentation tanks are a simple and low-cost method the concentration achieved without prior coagulation flocculation coagulation is relatively low Ortiz et al. 2021 . Similarly in lamella-type separators microalgal concentration is unreliable andlow which requires further thickening Barros and Berk 2018 . In practice the choice of microalgae harvesting method including sedimentation de- pends on various factors such as the specific microalgal species the scale of cultivation the required biomass concentration and the overall goals of the cultivation process. Sedimentation remains a valuable and reliable method for harvesting microalgae in many ap- plications particularly in large-scale low-energy and cost-conscious operations. However it should be considered alongside other harvesting techniques to determine the most suitable approach for a particular situation. 7.3. Bioflocculation Harvesting techniques like flotation flocculation and flocculation can be used to harvest microalgae. The flotation technique is the separation process in which air or gas bubbles lift suspended particles at the top of the liquid surface where they are collected by skimming Sarwer et al. 2022a b . The process of flotation can harvest marine and freshwater microalgae. Low volume requirements short operating cost large-scale harvesting and adaptability rate at low starting cost are the advantages of using floatation. The flota- tion process requires flocculants and is followed by flocculation and coagulation Singh and Patidar 2018 . The flocculation tech- nique involves aggregating small and unstable particles by electrostatic patching bridging or surface charge neutralization after adding flocculants Matter et al. 2019 . The formation of flocs allows for recovery or separation by conventional or simple gravity- induced settling methods. Flocculation is the superior method for microalgae harvesting because of its economic feasibility and effi- ciency Muhammad et al. 2021 . Biogenic or non-biogenic flocculants are used during algal harvesting. Chemical flocculants are widely utilized for effective harvesting but the high cost is a significant drawback Singh et al. 2023 . To overcome this bio- flocculation-based microalgae harvesting technology is a promising strategy at a low cost for algal biomass production Ummalyma et al. 2017 . Microalgal flocculation made by extracellular polymeric substances EPS and various types of microbes is termed floccula- tion Alam et al. 2016 . Recently researchers have been focusing on fungus-induced flocculation associated with bacteria algae- algae flocculation and flocculation based on plants Muhammad et al. 2021 . Bioflocculation could be a valuable and sustainable Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 14 S. Tomar et al. option for microalgae harvesting particularly in scenarios where energy efficiency high biomass recovery and reduced chemical us- age are priorities. 7.4. Flotation In the flotation process gas or air is transformed into bubbles by the liquid solid suspension due to which solid particles will at- tach to gaseous molecules and are carried out and accumulated on the surface Rakesh et al. 2020 . It has been reported that the flotation process is quicker for various microalgae species than sedimentation. Arenas et al. 2017 . Flotation mainly includes dis- persed air flotation DiAF dissolved air flotation DAF and electro-flotation EF Xu et al. 2021 . Dissolved air flotation technique uses small bubble sizes ranging from 10 to 100 mm generated when air gets dissolved in water under high pressure Chen et al. 2011 . The bubbles force suspended algae cells to float on the surface which could further be skimmed off. In dispersed air flotation 700-1500 mm bubbles are produced by continuously passing the air through a high-speed mechanical agitator or by porous material like spargers or diffusers. This flotation technique requires less energy but equipment cost is high and the pressure drop during air bubbles generation is high Hassanzadeh et al. 2022 . In electro-flotation microalgae cells float on the water surface with fine hydro- gen bubbles formed by electrolysis. Microalgal biomass could be separated from the growth medium by hydrogen evaluated at the cathode. Bubbles of hydrogen stick to the algal flocs and then force them to float on the surface Singh and Patidar 2018 . No require- ment of chemicals is the benefit of using this technique while high power requirement and cathode fouling are the major drawbacks of this type of flotation technique Hassanzadeh et al. 2022 . The harvesting method flotation should consider factors such as the specific microalgal strain the scale of cultivation the desired biomass concentration and the available resources. Flotation can be a valuable and sustainable option for microalgae harvesting particularly in scenarios where energy efficiency high biomass recovery and reduced chemical usage are priorities. However successful implementation may require careful process optimization and consid- erations of microalgal strain compatibility. 8. Technologies for biofuel production from algae 8.1. Biodiesel production The very first pre-requirement for the production of biodiesel from microalgae is lipid extraction. The process of lipid extraction contributes 30 40 of the total cost in the production of biodiesel V. Kumar et al. 2019 . Since microalgae have thick cell walls and membranes lipid extraction is challenging. The most important aspect for producing biodiesel at an affordable cost is believed to be the effectiveness of lipid extraction from microalgae Karim et al. 2020 . The inner membrane of microalgae is formed by a microfib- ril matrix of hemicellulose and cellulose and the cell wall is enriched with a polysaccharide matrix. Plant oil mechanical extraction methods are ineffective due to the extremely small size of microalgae cells 3 10 μm . As a result greener solvent systems such as ionic liquids ILs pyrolysis CO2 SC CO2 and switchable solvents have been investigated for the extraction of lipids Sequeira et al. 2021 . 8.1.1. Soxhlet method The Soxhlet extraction method could extract a range of volatile compounds from solid samples into the oil. After removal the sol- vent containing the extracted biocompound is returned to the flask and the process is replicated until all the analytes have been re- moved. The extraction solvent must be explicitly selected since different removal solvents will produce other natural compounds from the same substance. The extract composition will differ from one solvent to another Liu et al. 2018 . When extracting chloroform us- ing the Soxhlet method the optimum solvent is methanol 2 1 Kumar et al. 2018 obtained 18.6 lipid from the freshwater macroalga. Generally Soxhlet extraction is a simple procedure that involves less effort and the isolated lipid can be used for conver- sion immediately. On the other hand this process is time-consuming tedious and requires a lot of energy. 8.1.2. Folch method Folch et al. 1957 studied the effects of a 1 2 v v methanol and chloroform on lipid extraction from animal tissue to obtain higher lipid yield Folch et al. 1957 . After filtration the homogenate and five folds of saline water were added to the lipid- containing solution. Once well combined the mixture is separated by gravity into two layers in which one layer contains lipids. Soares et al. 2014 investigated fatty acid methyl ester extraction efficiency in 3 different microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata Chaetocerosmuelleri and Chlorella sp using different methods Folch method-chloroform methanol 2 1 v v hexane ethanol 4 1 pure hexane Bligh and Dyer method-methanol for protein removal ammonia and ethanol mixture is used followed by addition of and petroleum and diethyl ether extraction of lipid . In all three microalgae the Folch method and methanol dichloromethane gave maximum lipid recovery Soares et al. 2014 . The Folch approach is undoubtedly a fast simple and effective lipid extraction method for huge volumes of materials. However this method has the disadvantage of using hazardous chemicals that increase opera- tional costs Kumar et al. 2019 . 8.1.3. Bligh and Dyer method Bligh and Dyer 1959 introduced a method that used a monophasic mixture of methanol and chloroform and water for extrac- tion Bligh and Dyer 1959 . This is the standard method to determine total lipid content. In this method chloroform methanol and water are used in two-step extraction and when the phases separate lipid content is evaluated in the chloroform phase. When a suitable amount of chloroform or water is added a two-phase system is created with lipids settling in the bottom chloroform layer. In contrast the non-lipid portion rises to the top layer of water and methanol. The strong bond between lipid and chloroform mole- cules leads to their separation. This method is usually implemented for lipid extraction from microalgae Vasistha et al. 2021 . The Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 15 S. Tomar et al. mixture of Chloroform methanol 1 1 gave the highest lipid content while optimizing the extraction of total and non-polar lipids. The authors also suggested that while using this mixture there is no need for pre-treatment or addition of antioxidants Wu et al. 2017 . Furthermore it was reported that sequence of solvent addition affects the efficiency of the lipid extraction from microalgae. Lipid extraction from dried Nanochloropsis cells showed that when the solvents were added in order of increasing polarity the ex- traction yield was increased from 185 mg 18.5 to 210 mg 21.0 confirming that the order of solvent addition is an important aspect to increase the extraction efficiency Cooney et al. 2009 . 8.2. Biohydrogen production The biohydrogen production methods are sustainable for producing hydrogen at ambient operating temperature and pressure. In biological route of hydrogen production renewable sources like biomass and solar energy is utilized to produce hydrogen through dark-fermentation photo-fermentation direct or indirect photolysis Akhlaghi and Najafpour-Darzi 2020 . Waste materials like rice winery wastewater molasses sugary wastewater municipal solid waste starch wastewater food wastes from rice straw sugarcane coir and sweet sorghum bagasse have been used as a substrate for biohydrogen production Rai et al. 2011 . Biohydrogen could also be produced using Microbial electrolysis cells MECs . MECs are unique biotechnological technologies that can produce H2 from or- ganic material present in wastewater or biomass. However this technology is still nascent with current issues of scaling up while at- taining a desired H2 yield Kadier et al. 2019 . To the best of our knowledge there is no report of H2 production by MECs using algal biomass as substrate. 8.2.1. Bio-photolysis Bio photolysis involves algal photosynthesis to dissociate water. Bio-photolysis is a biological method where sunlight dissociates water molecules with the help of photosynthetic membranes and catalysts. Two types of bio photolysis are widely studied indirect and direct. 8.2.1.1. Direct photolysis. In direct photolysis photosystems PS I and PS II in cyanobacteria and green algae cells absorb light en- ergy to split water molecules into H+ ions and O2 molecules Rai et al. 2020 . Cyanobacteria as well as microalgae can carry it out. On absorbing energy the electron in PS II gets excited and transfers to Ferredoxin via PS I Dincer and Acar 2015 . This e-is further transferred by ferredoxin to enzymehydrogenase which is present in algal cells that reduces H+ to H2 da Silva Veras et al. 2017 . Direct photolysis faces challenges related to low hydrogen production rates oxygen inhibition microalgae sensitivity to environmen- tal conditions and the cost of cultivation and processing. 8.2.1.2. Indirect photolysis. It takes place in two steps. In step 1 the water molecule splits to give oxygen in the presence of light and H+. In step 2 CO2 fixation and carbohydrate release occur producing hydrogen in the presence of enzyme hydrogenase. Among hydrogenase and nitrogenase the hydrogen production rate from green algae is high for the hydrogenase enzyme. Indirect photolysis faces challenges related to process complexity energy input oxygen sensitivity cost of cultivation and scale-up com- plexity. 12H2O + 6CO2 +light C6H12O6 + 6O2 C6H12O6 + 12H2O + light 12H12 + 6CO2 8.2.2. Dark-fermentation In the dark-fermentative biohydrogen production organic substrates such as sugars wastewater amino acids etc. produce hydro- gen by employing anaerobic organisms without light Christopher et al. 2021 . Its low production cost makes it a favourable alterna- tive to conventional methods Dahiya et al. 2021 . There are three types of hydrogen-producing bacteria-non sporulating anaerobes facultative bacteria and spore-forming obligate anaerobic bacteria. The spore-forming anaerobic microorganism such as Clostridium sp. is more efficient in producing hydrogen Castelló et al. 2020 . The various factors that affect hydrogen yield are pressure temper- ature hydraulic retention time pH etc. Garcia-Depraect et al. 2021 . It is imperative to pre-treat the algal biomass before its use as substrate in biohydrogen production Singh et al. 2022 . Although dark-fermentation offers advantages in terms of hydrogen yield substrate flexibility and high hydrogen purity. However it also faces challenges related to lower conversion efficiency pre-treatment cost byproduct formation pH control and sensitivity to inhibitors. Researchers have to explore the ways to optimize dark- fermentation for microalgae based biohydrogen production for sustainable hydrogen production. 8.2.3. Photo-fermentation In Photo-fermentation the photosynthetic bacteria convert organic substrates into hydrogen through hydrogenase and nitroge- nase under suitable operating conditions Rai et al. 2020 . The organic compounds give hydrogen in nitrogeniscatalyzed reactions inthe presence of light using bacteria which perform photosynthesis or anaerobic bacteria like Rhodopseudonomas Rhodospirillumand Rhodobacter Hitam and Jalil 2020 . Using Fe and Mo further improves the hydrogen yield. Light availability and specific substrate requirements such as small fatty acids having acetate and propionate are the major hurdles to the industrialization of this method Baeyens et al. 2020 . The photo-fermentation step is carried out on the spent medium obtained after dark-fermentation of microal- gae biomass for biohydrogen production. Although Photo-fermentation for biohydrogen production from microalgae holds promise as a renewable energy source with reduced environmental impacts. However it faces challenges related to process complexity en- ergy balance low yield reactor design contamination and economic viability. Ongoing research and development efforts are focused Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 16 S. Tomar et al. on optimizing the process to overcome these limitations and make photo-fermentation a more practical and sustainable option for hy- drogen production. 9. Bioethanol Bioethanol production from algae biomass involves converting the carbohydrates in algae into ethanol which can be used as a re- newable fuel Sirajunnisa and Surendhiran 2016 . Algae are considered a promising feedstock for bioethanol production due to their high growth rates and ability to accumulate significant amounts of carbohydrates Khan et al. 2018 . For bioethanol production from microalgae the first step is the cultivation of algae in open ponds closed Photo-bioreactors or other suitable cultivation systems Yen et al. 2019 . The growth conditions such as nutrient availability light and temperature need to be optimized to maximize biomass production Khan et al. 2018 . Once the algae reach a desirable biomass concentration harvesting of the biomass has to be done. Harvesting methods include filtration centrifugation flocculation or a combination of these techniques Tan et al. 2020 . The har- vested algae biomass is typically pre-treated to break down the rigid cell walls and improve the accessibility of carbohydrates Weber et al. 2022 . Standard pre-treatment methods include mechanical disruption thermal treatment or chemical treatment. The physical pre-treatment reduces the size of lignocellulosic biomass and crystallinity by extrusion irradiation grinding and milling methods Edeh 2021 . Chemical pre-treatment involves oxidative delignification alkali acid and organic acid methods. These methods are unique for a specific type of feedstocks and help remove lignin hemicellulose from the polymer matrix Edeh 2021 . The pre- treatment methods using chemicals are helpful but require severe operating conditions which may result in adverse effects during the downstream process Kumar et al. 2020 . The pre-treated biomass is then subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis where enzymes such as cellulases and hemicellulases break down the complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars like glucose and xylose Nordin et al. 2022 . These sugars are the primary feedstock for ethanol production. For further processes i.e. fermentation to occur this hydroly- sis stage requires enzymes that can only digest monomer sugars. Enzymes or acids are required to catalyze the process. Hydrolysis by acid catalysis is the most widely used involving diluted or concentrated acid H2SO4 and HCl Edeh 2021 . C6H10O5 n + H3O+ H2O + nC6H12O6 β-glucosidases cellobiohydrolases and endo-1 4-β-glucanases are the cellulase enzymes used during hydrolysis but are expensive be- cause of their high demand in industries Sharma et al. 2020 . The hydrolyzed sugars are fermented by adding specific yeast or bacte- ria strains that can convert sugars into ethanol through anaerobic fermentation Walker and Stewart 2016 . The fermentation process converts the sugars into ethanol and produces carbon dioxide. C6H12O6 + yeast 2C2H5OH + 2CO2 Sharma et al. 2020 Senatore et al. 2020 Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most common microbe used during fermentation because of its high productivity rate and high tol- erance limits Surendhiran and Sirajunnisa 2019 . Saccharomyces cerevisiae converts mannose fructose and glucose to ethanol while xylan can be converted to xylose. After fermentation the resulting mixture contains a low ethanol concentration water and other impurities. The ethanol is then concentrated through distillation followed by further purification steps like dehydration to remove water and obtain a higher ethanol concentration Khalid et al. 2019 . The pure ethanol is recovered from the distillation process and any remaining impurities are removed to meet the required quality standards Suthar et al. 2019 . The recovered ethanol can be used as a biofuel or further processed for various applications. Azeotropic adsorption extractive membrane and diffusion distillation are the techniques used for ethanol recovery. For large-scale operations the extractive distillation process is most commonly used Edeh 2021 . It is worth noting that bioethanol production from algae biomass is still in the research and development stage. Various challenges must be addressed such as optimizing the cultivation process improving biomass conver- sion efficiency reducing the energy inputs required and scaling up production to a commercially viable level Usmani et al. 2021 . However ongoing advancements in biotechnology and process engineering hold promise for the future of algae-based bioethanol production Kostas et al. 2021 . Table 6 shows the carbohydrate content of algal species with bioethanol yield. Bioethanol production from algae faces challenges related to operation cost ethanol tolerance cultivation pre-treatment cost and efficiency and competition with other land uses. For commercialization of bioethanol production technology from microalgae the circular economy and carbon neutrality concept has to be follow. 10. Biobutanol Biobutanol is the butanol produced from organic natural renewable or biodegradable biomass. Biobutanol could be produced from eco-friendly biomass by alcoholic fermentation Pugazhendhi et al. 2019 . Biobutanol is gaining more attention as a potential alternative to ethanol and demand for fermentative biobutanol production has gained interest Wang et al. 2017 . The availability of feedstock is the major challenge faced during biobutanol production. The use of agricultural biomass as feedstock is less efficient and controversial. In contrast the third-generation feedstock microalgae has been considered as promising for biobutanol production because of its high carbohydrate content and growth rate Wang et al. 2017 . Biological acetone-biobutanol-ethanol ABE fermenta- tion has the potential to replace chemical synthesis for the production of butanol Xue et al. 2017 . Over the past few decades at the commercial level renewable biobutanol could be produced from cellulosic and non-cellulosic feedstock. ABE fermentation denotes the anaerobic fermentation of sugars in the medium of ethanol acetone and butanol in the ratio of 1 3 6. The strains of Clostidia used for industrial butanol production are C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum C. beijerincki C. saccharobutylicum and C. acetobutylicum Wang et al. 2017 . While employing microalgal biomass as a feedstock the pre-treatment of the biomass is essential to disrupt the microal- Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 17 S. Tomar et al. gae cells to release the constituent sugars Wang et al. 2017 . Glucose and mannose are the most common hexose sugars released with others including Rhamnose Fructose Galactose and Fructose. Currently the four technologies most commonly used for pre- treatment microalgal biomass are mechanical thermal biological enzymatic and chemical Obata et al. 2016 . Among these me- chanical and thermal pre-treatments are efficient for cell disruption in microalgae. In continuous reactors thermal pre-treatments are the most employed method Mehariya et al. 2021 . Pre-treatment with chemicals is usually conducted at high temperatures. For the production of butanol microalgal biomass and acid hydrolysis wastewater microalgae pre-treatment was conducted using 1.01 M sulphuric acid at 80 90 °C for 120 min Song et al. 2021 . Mechanical pre-treatment is independent of the microalgae species and the associated differences in the cell wall structure Onumaegbu et al. 2018 . The pre-treatment with chemicals works better if combined with any other method and the combination of chemical and thermal methods is successful Ramos et al. 2022 . Thermal microalgal biomass decomposes at 108 °C for ABE fermentation Elkatory et al. 2022 . Mechanical and thermal pre-treatments lead to cell dis- ruption but they cannot obtain a high yield of monosaccharides. Chemical pre-treatment can break the cell walls and hydrolyze mi- croalgae carbohydrate into fermentable sugars. However some inhibitory compounds are produced during the process of chemical pre-treatment and affect butanol production and cell growth during fermentation Wang et al. 2017 . Enzymatic pre-treatment can be used to increase soluble sugar recovery from the carbohydrate content of microalgae biomass without producing any inhibitors during fermentation Lakatos et al. 2019 . Biobutanol production from microalgae offers the potential for a renewable and more ver- satile biofuel compared to ethanol. However it faces challenges related to production cost low butanol yield butanol toxicity pre- treatment cost and competitive market. Ongoing research and development efforts aim to overcome these challenges and make biobutanol from microalgae a more economically viable option. 11. Biomethane Biomethane is a promising biofuel that can be produced from various biomass using anaerobic digestion AD Zabed et al. 2019 . The biomass sources include agricultural residues food wastes forestry residues microalgae industrial organic waste energy crops and organic-rich wastewater Cucchiella and D Adamo 2016 Jankowska et al. 2017 . Among all these sources microalgae are con- sidered the most attractive feedstock because of their high biomass yield five to ten times higher growth rate and suitability to culti- vate in nutrient-rich wastewaters and nonarable lands in addition microalgae have the potential to consume CO2 thus reduce its ac- cumulation in the atmosphere Stephens et al. 2013 Kröger and Müller-Langer 2012 Ward et al. 2014 . The pre-treatment tech- niques for producing biomethane include physical chemical and biological methods Uggetti et al. 2017 . In recent studies it has been shown that pre-treatment of microalgae is beneficial in improving AD performance. Some pre-treatment like microwave ther- mal and enzymatic have already been tested in continuous reactors while thermochemical ultrasound and hydrolysis have been tested in biochemical methane potential BMP tests Uggetti et al. 2017 . The thermal pre-treatment at low temperatures 100 °C for example after thermal pre-treatment at 100 120 °C the yield of methane byNannochloropsis salina has been increased by 108 while the yield of methane increased 3-fold by Scenedesmus sp. Ometto et al. 2014 . The pre-treatment by ultrasound method increases the final methane yield by 33 Alagöz et al. 2018 . In summary methane production from microalgae offers the potential to generate renew- able energy while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and treating wastewater. However it comes with challenges related to cost long start up periods cultivation and the need for infrastructure. As technology advances and research continues addressing these challenges may lead to more efficient and economically viable methane production from microalgae. 12. Commercial feasibility of microalgae cultivation for biofuel production The production of biofuels from microalgal biomass is gaining interest due to a number of significant characteristics of microal- gae. However still the technologies for biofuel production from microalgae are costly and not efficient. Tables 7 and 8 list the various technologies and steps utilized for algae conversion into biofuel with their process efficiency and cost. A study analyzed the econom- ics of a sugar industry s waste effluent and byproducts as low-cost carbon dioxide and nutrient sources for microalgal biofuel produc- tion that was theoretically related to the factory Zewdie and Ali 2022 . In this regard promising sources of future biofuel have been found in microalgae. In situ conversion biochemical conversion thermochemical conversion and conversion after extraction are al- ternate methods for producing biofuel from microalgae Karpagam et al. 2021 . According to some research it is resource- and en- ergy-efficient to simultaneously produce biodiesel from the transesterification of extracted oil and biogas from anaerobic digestion Broberg et al. 2011 . The cost of producing microalgal biomass is substantially higher than other energy crops Kitchen et al. 2019 . Microalgal-based carbon capture could be more economical if the algal biomass 2 g L is converted to biofuels pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals through biorefinery approach yield range 60 99.5 Tarafdar et al. 2023 . Despite the recent developments only limited investigations are available on its economic aspects that indicate a production cost of 0.5 15 kg microalgal biomass. Microalgae multiplies rapidly and has a great potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and recycle it into bioenergy Ummalyma et al. 2022 . The advanced focused areas for the viability of microalgal biofuel production are genetic engineering for strain improvement the bio-refinery technique for effective material and energy utilization and economical nutrient and CO2 sources Kitchen et al. 2019 . To enhance biofuel yield some authors suggested to employe nanomaterial-bound microbial enzymes and nanocatalysts AQUASTAT 2016 . Combining wastewater treatment with microalgal cultivation is essential to lower the production cost. This will reduce environmental pollution and nutrient costs. One of these plants with an attached distillery is the Metahara sugar factory in the nation s southeast. It has an annual capacity of around 130 000 t of sugar and 12 000 t of ethanol Broberg et al. 2011 Jeyakumar et Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 53 2023 102877 18 S. Tomar et al.

Tomar et al. al. 2022 explored the biofuel production from Padina tetrastromatica and Sargassum swartzii macro-algae biomass by fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas Mobilis. The results obtained Bioethanol yield 80 indicated that both the species are suitable for Bioethanol production. Further the utilized biomass after bioethanol production was used for the lipid extraction for biodiesel production. The biodiesel yield was improved after the addition of Nano-catalyst MgO.La2O3. This integrated approach paves the new pathway for bioethanol and biodiesel production from the same algal biomass making the process more economically viable. The design of PBRs for the cultivation of microalgae is an important aspect for its optimum operation and cost effectiveness. The high capital input in research and development and operating cost the designing and scaling-up of PBRs remain a challenge. It is imperative to develop hybrid PBRs to improve the process efficiency and overall input cost Sirohi et al. 2022 . To follow the princi- ples of circular economy and carbon neutrality it is imperative to develop specialized PBRs capable of simultaneous biofuels produc- tion wastewater treatment and CO2 fixation. Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD could be used as a tool for the design and scale-up of a such type of PBRs. The CFD modelling of PBRs involving fluid dynamics light transport and algal growth kinetics will result into the development of more efficient and less operating cost required PBRs. Ranganathan et al. 2022 suggested multi-scale modelling approach and development of low-cost efficient computational framework for the development of PBRs in future. Furthermore the group recommends the utilization of process intensification techniques for improving the PBRs in terms of hydrodynamics mixing and mass transfer performances and algal growth productivity. 13. Challenges and future directions Microalgae-based biofuel generation has drawn much attention as a potential replacement for fossil fuels. However there are still many issues that must be resolved before microalgae-based biofuels may be widely commercialized. Some critical challenges and po- tential directions for this area are Cost-effectiveness Maintaining ideal growth conditions and separating the microalgae from the culture media requires much energy ultimately adding to the biofuel production cost. In order to reduce energy and cost inputs fu- ture research should concentrate on developing cost-effective cultivation systems and harvesting methods Strain selection and ge- netic engineering Improving biofuel productivity requires finding new microalgal strains with high lipid or carbohydrate content and rapid growth rates. Exploration of genetic engineering and synthetic biology techniques should continue in the future in order to cre- ate superior strains that are more effective in producing biofuel Nutrient availability and wastewater utilization The cost and envi- ronmental impact of growing microalgae for biofuels can be decreased by creating sustainable nutrient sources such as using waste- water or industrial wastes. Future research should concentrate on improving nutrient recycling systems and investigating new nutri- ent sources Scale-up and commercialization Most research on microalgae-based biofuels has been done in laboratories or on a small scale. Maintaining consistent productivity improving large-scale cultivation systems and devising effective downstream processing strategies are just a few of the difficulties associated with scaling up production to commercial levels. Future studies should concen- trate on proving that large-scale production is feasible and addressing the commercialization-related technical and financial difficul- ties Life cycle assessment LCA and sustainability The evaluation of the environmental impact of microalgae cultivation and biofuel production using life cycle assessments can assist in pinpointing areas for research and ensure sustainability. Future studies should keep evaluating the environmental and social consequences of producing biofuel from microalgae and come up with plans for mini- mizing those effects Co-product utilization Microalgae during cultivation produce valuable co-products such as high-value chemi- cals animal feed or fertilizer. Using these co-products may improve the commercial viability of producing microalgae-based biofuels. Future efforts should concentrate on developing effective co-product extraction and processing methods and investigating market and application opportunities. In broad terms overcoming these obstacles and expanding research in these directions will be essential to maximizing the poten- tial of microalgae-based biofuel production as a sustainable and practical replacement for fossil fuels. 14. Conclusion The utilization of algae as a feedstock for biofuel production has garnered significant attention due to its numerous advantages such as high growth rates minimal land requirements and potential for carbon dioxide sequestration. The conversion of algal bio- mass into biofuels involves numerous processes and each has its own set of challenges and opportunities and ongoing research efforts are focused on improving conversion efficiencies and reducing costs. The interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists engineers policymakers and industry stakeholders is very much required to realizing the full potential of this renewable and environmentally friendly energy source. Till date no known process ranging from algae cultivation harvesting conversion to biofuel is 100 efficient. The concepts of circular economy and carbon neutrality cost benefit analysis life cycle assessment should be followed and analyzed while promoting a technology for commercialization related to algae based biofuel production. The efficient reactor design and oper- ation could also enhance the success rate of this carbon neutral technology. No known reactor design or operation is available having 100 light conversion efficiency. The literature available clearly indicate that no single technology has the potential of commercial- ization of the algae based biofuels. The only solution to this hurdle is to integrate the process of wastewater treatment carbon seques- tration Biofuel production and value added compounds production. Overall algal biomass holds great potential as a renewable and sustainable energy source. Although several technical and economic challenges need to be addressed ongoing research and develop- ment efforts are steadily pushing the field forward.

Not only the storage capacity is limited but also the use of the ecological environment causes great damage a serious threat to human life safety. Microalgae biodiesel receives extensive attention due to its biodegradable and carbon-neutral green energy characteristics which is used to reduce or replace the use of these fossil fuels. Because of the slow growth of microalgae low lipid content and low biodiesel production people begin to study ways to improve the growth and lipid production of microalgae and catalytic conversion of biodiesel. In this paper the research progress of the whole process from microalgae culture to microalgae oil production to microalgae catalytic conversion of biodiesel in recent years is reviewed. The efficient growth and oil production of microalgae the catalytic conversion methods of microalgae biodiesel and the application prospects of microalgae biodiesel are discussed and summarized. Specifically this review critically discusses i The current development status of microalgae culture and microalgae biodiesel ii Cultivation methods for efficient growth and oil production of microalgae under different stress conditions iii The effects of different types of catalysts and catalytic methods on the yield of biodiesel iv Environmental problems and economic value of the whole process of microalgae biodiesel production v Current limitations and future research directions in the field of microalgae biodiesel. Studies show that regulating light temperature pH nutrients etc. can improve the growth and oil production of microalgae in which the addition of anions and cations can change the physiological biochemical and metabolic mechanisms of microalgae. At present a large number of genetic modification and metabolic regulation engi neering technologies are applied to microalgae oil production. They have precise control of the targeting mechanism in cells to induce increased lipid accumulation. The two-stage culture model can simultaneously increase biomass and lipid content. The addition of homogeneous heterogeneous biological enzymes and nano- catalysts accelerates the conversion efficiency and improves the yield of biodiesel. The catalytic yield of several magnetic nano-catalysts studied is as high as 98 . The supercritical method and ionic liquid method are favored by everyone because they do not use catalysts to reduce environmental pollution. In situ trans esterification replaces the traditional two-step transesterification method to reduce energy consumption and cumbersome steps. Hydrothermal liquefaction method can directly convert wet algae biomass into biofuels without drying at high temperatures and pressure and in the presence of water. However the current high-cost economic problems in the production of microalgae biodiesel and the environmental problems caused by the addition of catalysts need to further study the efficient and low-cost microalgae culture methods and new environmentally friendly catalysts and catalytic methods to improve the yield of microalgae biodiesel to realize the commercial production of microalgae biodiesel as soon as possible.

Introduction Fossil fuels including coal petroleum and natural gas remain the main source of global energy supply. In the past few decades energy consumption and CO2 emissions have increased rapidly due to increasing population and energy demand exacerbating global climate change Mikhaylov et al. 2020 Jeffry et al. 2021 . Excessive emission of CO2 is the main cause of the greenhouse effect. Excessive CO2 seri ously destroys the ecological balance and hurts humans animals and plants. A report submitted by the United Nations Environment Pro gramme points out that about 37 billion metric tons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere every year accounting for 74 of the total greenhouse gas emissions. It is expected that the global average tem perature will rise by 2 C by 2050 Johnson 2019 . Environmental and energy issues have intensified people s interest in renewable fuels and the development of biofuels has become necessary such as bioethanol biodiesel biohydrogen and biogas to reduce or replace the use of these fossil fuels. Biodiesel has attracted wide attention for its biodegrad ability and carbon neutrality Kim et al. 2022 . It is a promising renewable energy source. Compared with other renewable energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy biodiesel is the most attractive alternative to petrochemical diesel. After mixing with gasoline at a rate of 85 they can be used directly without any modification of the engine Fulton et al. 2015 . Scientists around the world are trying to turn their attention to the study of high-quality biodiesel. Microalgae cells have a simple structure and can grow only by light CO2 water and nutrients. Microalgae has high photosynthetic efficiency and rapid growth. Under appropriate conditions they can undergo one or two cell divisions per day. Generally the biomass can be doubled in one day. Some algal strains such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella can even be doubled in a few hours especially in polyculture autotrophic and heterotrophic combination Yang et al. 2022a . Microalgae can grow throughout the year and the CO2 fixed by microalgae photosynthesis accounts for more than 40 of the global CO2 fixed amount each year. It does not compete for food production resources and is not limited by seasons which can ensure a stable supply of raw materials for production Siddiki et al. 2022 . Microalgae are highly versatile and adaptable and they can thrive in wastewater and saline water Ali et al. 2021 . Wastewater contains a large amount of inorganic salts which are mainly in the form of ions such as carbonate ions phosphate ions copper ions iron ions and calcium ions etc. Excessive discharge of wastewater e.g. brine will reduce water qual ity. At present the world is facing a serious shortage of water resources. It can be solved by using the seawater desalination brine salty waste water process. Among them high-pressure reverse osmosis HPRO and hot steam compression multi-effect distillation MED-TVC are commonly used methods for treating seawater desalination brine Panagopoulos 2022 Panagopoulos 2020a Panagopoulos 2020b . In addition microalgae can efficiently absorb nutrient salts in wastewater use them for growth and metabolism and produce high-value com pounds reduce water body eutrophication with strong environmental restoration ability and economic value Chew et al. 2018 . Compared with the previous two generations of biodiesel feedstocks animal and vegetable oils and waste gutter oils Ianda et al. 2022 microalgae is more suitable as a potential biodiesel feedstock because it not only has high biomass and lipid content but also is environmentally and economically friendly and feasible. Lipid is one of the most important metabolites in the growth and reproduction of microalgae and is an important source of biodiesel and high-value-added products. Triacylglycerol TAG is the main form of lipid accumulation in microalgae and serves as the energy for the sur vival and maintenance of microalgae Ananthi et al. 2021a . According to the different microalgae species and microalgae culture conditions the lipid content of microalgae accounts for 20 60 of its stem cell weight Bibi et al. 2022a . The lipid content and biodiesel yield of microalgae are 15 300 times that of oil-bearing crops such as corn soybean sunflower and castor Shah et al. 2018 . The high lipid content of microalgae makes it a suitable raw material for biodiesel production. Microalgae can usually produce a large amount of biomass but the lipid content is relatively low. Under ideal culture conditions microalgae produce polar lipids by synthesizing fatty acids. When the growth con ditions are unfavorable or stressed microalgae will change their biosynthetic pathways synthesize neutral lipids mainly TAG and maintain their survival through the formation and accumulation of neutral lipids Chin et al. 2023 . Microalgae can effectively change the lipid metabolism pathway by changing the culture environment so they can adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. The lipid content of microalgae can be increased by external environmental stress Bibi et al. 2022b such as nutrient limitation light intensity temperature pH and CO2 but the growth rate of microalgae will slow down because the interference of cell biological processes leads to a decrease in cell division rate and slows down cell proliferation. Environmental stress may be counterproductive to some extent. However the new two-stage culture model can solve this problem Aziz et al. 2020 . Two-stage culture first increases biomass in a well-nourished environment and then increases lipid content by utilizing stress to achieve high biomass and high lipid content. In recent years co-culture of microalgae and other microorganisms such as bacteria co-culture is a biological system in which two or more different organisms grow together in natural or synthetic media has been shown to increase microalgae biomass lipid content and yield of high-value products Zheng et al. 2023 . In addi tion to environmental stress there are a large number of studies such as genetic modification and metabolic engineering techniques that have been applied to this field to induce increased lipid accumulation by precisely controlling the targeting mechanisms in cells Ranjbar and Malcata 2022 . Traditionally the synthesis of biodiesel from microalgae biomass includes two steps. One is to extract lipid from microalgae biomass and the other is to catalyze the transesterification of microalgae lipid to biodiesel. In this reaction fatty acids are hydrolyzed and methylated into fatty acid methyl ester biodiesel Hu et al. 2008 . The traditional two-step method does not have good economic value as the need to consume more energy and the one-step method can solve this prob lem. The one-step method is also known as the in-situ trans esterification method that is lipid extraction and catalytic transesterification are carried out simultaneously Thanh et al. 2022 . The addition of catalysts is the key to making significant progress in the biodiesel industry which greatly improves the reaction rate Zul et al. 2021 . Most biodiesel catalysts are homogeneous catalysts which are attractive because they can produce high biodiesel yield at low cost in a short time. However this type of catalyst is often mixed with the product and is difficult to separate resulting in equipment corrosion and water pollution Gupta and Singh 2023 . Heterogeneous catalysts are a good substitute for homogeneous catalysts owing to their high efficiency and environmental friendliness and heterogeneous catalysts are suitable for raw materials containing high concentrations of free fatty acids FFA Galadima and Muraza 2014 . Since its high specific surface area high catalytic activity high saponification resistance and good rigidity the new nano-catalyst can easily solve the problems of mass transfer resis tance low efficiency time-consuming and the use of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts Mittal and Ghosh 2023 . Bio-enzyme cata lyzed transesterification especially lipase-based transesterification is an environmentally friendly method that can solve the unfriendly environmental problems of the chemical catalysis acid and alkali cat alysts transesterification process. However the transesterification of enzymes has a high cost and slow reaction rate and the utilization and regeneration of catalysts are limited Christopher et al. 2014 . The addition of the catalyst not only increases the separation and recovery steps but also the disposal of the catalyst is harmful to the environment. Transesterification reaction can also be carried out without a catalyst Kusdiana and Saka 2001 introduced a new supercritical fluid trans esterification process for the synthesis of biodiesel. Supercritical fluids H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 3 are fluids whose temperature and pressure are higher than their critical points. These fluids have high diffusivity and solubility. Supercritical transesterification does not require the addition of catalysts raw ma terial pretreatment and extraction of lipid from microalgae biomass. The extraction and reaction can be completed simultaneously in one step and biodiesel can be obtained in only a few minutes Rathnam and Madras 2019 . Another new method for biodiesel production is the ILs method. ILs are composed of cations and anions and are a liquid organic salt at room temperature. It is considered to be a new environmentally friendly production route because it can be used as a solvent and catalyst for microalgae biodiesel production. The catalytic reaction of ILs has been proven to have the advantages of high reactivity and simple sep aration steps under mild conditions Ong et al. 2021 . The use of microalgae to produce biodiesel has been well studied but the economic and environmental issues of the entire biorefinery process are still a challenge for its commercialization such as the chemical costs and pollution issues involved in upstream processing the extraction of high value-added products from microalgae and the catalytic conver sion of downstream processed products into biodiesel yield and quality issues. Microalgae is regarded as the most promising feedstock for the third generation of biodiesel production. Despite some challenges microalgae biodiesel is still attractive and has broad prospects for commercial application. At present there is no research on the whole process method of microalgae biodiesel production in the published review articles. This review summarizes and discusses the whole process method of microalgae biodiesel production in recent years including microalgae growth microalgae oil production and microalgae catalytic conversion of biodiesel. The effects of anions and cations on the physi ology and biochemistry of microalgae and the effects of genetic meta bolic regulation on the lipid accumulation of microalgae are emphatically introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of different catalysts and catalytic methods in the production of microalgae bio diesel are compared.

Efficient growth of microalgae Microalgae is the primary producers of aquatic ecosystems. They have the characteristics of fast growth and a simple culture. They can grow in various habitats and preferentially in aquatic environments but they can also grow in other spaces including deserts and permafrost Levasseur et al. 2020 . According to the way microalgae use carbon sources microalgae culture types can be divided into three types photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixed culture Bo et al. 2023 . Photoautotrophy is the most commonly used culture method because of its energy-saving and environmental protection. Photoautotrophy can be carried out in open-air runway pools and photobioreactors mainly relying on sunlight or other light sources and using CO2 as an inorganic carbon source. However the light culture mode needs to consider maintaining a sterile environment and good light penetration. Compared with the photoautotrophic mode the main advantage of the heterotrophic mode is that it does not depend on the light source. The growth of microalgae mainly depends on the organic carbon source in the medium but the heterotrophic mode is susceptible to bacterial contamination. The mixed culture mode is a combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic. Microalgae consume both organic and inorganic carbon sources under this culture condition which improves the biomass productivity of microalgae Arun et al. 2021 2022 . Micro algae similar to terrestrial plants also have photosynthetic characteristics that is capturing sunlight radiation and absorbing CO2 in the atmosphere so that they can grow and reproduce. It takes about 1.8 kg of CO2 to produce 1 kg of dry microalgae most microalgae can adapt and grow under various CO2 concentrations which is mediated by a series of changes at different cellular levels including changes in gene expression involved in the CO2 concentration mechanism operation CCM . The CO2 concentration mechanism is a mechanism for algal cells to effectively conduct photosynthesis at low CO2 concentrations. This mechanism involves a variety of proteins such as inorganic carbon transport carriers ATPases provide active transport of HCO3 to energy and one or several carbonic anhydrases Priyadharsini et al. 2022 . Microalgae can also convert nutrients in wastewater into high-value compounds to meet their growth Abdelfattah et al. 2023 Such po tential has attracted people s attention. The growth of microalgae was affected by adjusting light intensity temperature pH and anion and cation conditions. This chapter will review the main factors affecting the growth of microalgae focusing on the effects of anions and cations on the growth of microalgae and the mechanism of physiological metabolism. 2.1. Effects of environmental factors on the growth of microalgae 2.1.1. Light conditions Light conditions including light intensity light wavelength and light-dark cycle are the key factors for the growth of microalgae. It is found that the biomass increases with the increase of light intensity below the light saturation limit. Although insufficient light supply will inhibit the growth of microalgae photoinhibition may occur when microalgae cells are exposed to strong light Xu et al. 2020 . An appropriate light cycle can improve the light efficiency and biomass of microalgae and protect microalgae cells from photoinhibition Yuan et al. 2020 . In the photosynthesis system fixing a CO2 molecule re quires 8 photons about 48 of the incident sunlight . However high photon flux density can cause light damage to microalgae and reduce photosynthetic efficiency. In this case the selected light-dark cycle will have an important impact on microalgae because microalgae cells can repair light-induced damage during the dark period. The growth of microalgae under different light intensities and different light cycles shows that light conditions have a great influence on microalgae Gonçalves et al. 2014 . EswaryDevi et al. 2022 studied the cultiva tion of two marine algae strains Chlorella salina and Spirulina subsalsa using an urban sewage mixed medium. The maximum biomass yield of Chlorella salina was 2.6 g L when the light intensity was 150 μmol m2 s the photoperiod was 16 8 h and the aeration rate was 0.2 vvm. The maximum biomass of Spirulina subsalsa was 2.9 g L when the light in tensity was adjusted to 100 μmol m2 s. Further acclimation of the two microalgae in municipal wastewater can also increase biomass produc tion which was 3.0 and 2.8 g L respectively indicating that it is feasible to use 40 60 of the wastewater mixed medium as a nutrient source. Another study by EswaryDevi and Parthiban 2020 also opti mized the microalgae culture conditions and the ratio of wastewater to medium. Under the optimized growth conditions such as 80 urban sewage mixed with 20 Fog s medium and the acclimation of waste water the biomass of Nostoc ellipsosporum increased from 1.4 g L to 2.9 g L and the removal rate of nitrogen and phosphate in wastewater was as high as nearly 90 . At 300 C the yield of bio-oil produced by hy drothermal liquefaction of biomass was 24.6 . 2.1.2. Temperature Temperature is one of the main factors determining the distribution and abundance of species and it is a key sensitive parameter affecting the enzyme activity and metabolic process in microalgae cells. Under normal circumstances the optimal culture temperature of most micro algae is between 20 and 30 C Barten et al. 2021 . Thermophilic algae which grow on the wooden structure of the cooling tower of a thermal power plant in central Mexico have heat-resistant molecules that make H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 4 up their cells. They can survive at temperatures up to 40 C Covarrubias et al. 2016 . This example is only a special case. When the temperature is lower than the optimal temperature the increase in temperature is beneficial to the growth of microalgae. When the temperature exceeds the optimal temperature the denaturation and inactivation of the enzyme will have a serious inhibitory effect Zhang et al. 2021 . The effect of temperature on photosynthesis is mainly caused by the complex dynamics of ribulose-1 5-bisphosphate. This catalytic enzyme of photosynthesis is involved in two competitive physiological pathways photosynthesis and photorespiration with dicarboxylase and oxygenase activity respectively affecting the growth and metabolism of micro algae Ras et al. 2013 . High and low temperatures have an unequal effect on microalgae culture. Most microalgae can tolerate temperatures around 15 C lower than the optimal temperature but only 2 4 C above the optimal temperature is not conducive to the growth of microalgae Gonzalez-Camejo et al. 2019 . 2.1.3. pH The pH is one of the key factors in controlling photosynthesis inorganic carbon distribution and metabolic characteristics of micro algae. It is very important to provide the optimal pH for the growth of microalgae. For example Chlorella is not conducive to growth under alkaline conditions. When the pH of 7 the biomass productivity of Chlorella is the highest and it is also easy to increase the biomass under acidic conditions. However when the pH of lower than 3 the growth of microalgae will be inhibited or even lethal Hao et al. 2022 Song et al. 2020 . The change in pH will affect the concentration of H+ and OH in the liquid medium of the medium as well as the protonation and deprotonation of the chemical groups on the cells and substrates thus changing the ζ potential of the cells and substrates. The ζ potential decreased with the increase of pH. The medium solution of microalgae had positive potential under acidic conditions and negative potential under alkaline conditions. The dissociation rate of carboxyl groups in microalgae cell membranes composed of polysaccharides proteins and lipids is inhibited at low pH and the dissociation rate of amino groups is increased. When the pH increases microalgae cells will release extra cellular substances to protect them from the surrounding environment Ahmad et al. 2021 Yuan et al. 2019 . 2.2. Effects of nutrients on the growth of microalgae In microalgae the cell development or culture metabolism of auto trophic microalgae requires sunlight and some basic inorganic compo nents such as CO2 and metal salts while heterotrophic microalgae require some additional organic compounds and nutrients such as N and P. N is the main nutrient for microalgae growth accounting for more than 1 10 of the biomass and is used to synthesize nutrients for nucleic acids and proteins. Therefore the lack of this nutrient may lead to a decrease in biomass production in microalgae culture. P is another important nutrient for the growth of algae. It plays a key role in cell structure energy storage information transmission and metabolic pathways. It is an important compound for the growth of photosynthetic microorganisms because it affects the composition of biomass and is directly related to the content of carbohydrates and lipids. This nutrient is a part of DNA and RNA molecules accounting for about 1 of the dry weight of microalgae on average Díaz et al. 2022 Saratale et al. 2022 Han et al. 2021 . Trace metal ions are essential for the growth of microalgae such as Fe3+ Mg2+ Zn2+ Ca2+ Cu2+ and so on. These metal ions maintain the growth and metabolism of microalgae. Fe3+ is an important electron acceptor in the photosynthetic process of micro algae and plays a central role in nitrogen fixation photosynthesis and other metabolic processes. Adding appropriate Fe3+ to participate in the basic enzyme reaction of photosynthesis can increase the carbon flow in the direction of microalgae growth and lipid synthesis Pancha et al. 2015 . Mg2+ ions play an important role in different metabolic processes and physiological pathways of microalgae and are the main elements in microalgae culture medium. Mg2+ is a component of chlorophyll mol ecules and the level of Mg2+ in the medium directly affects the bio logical formation of chlorophyll Concas et al. 2021 . Ca2+ plays a key role in the signal transduction of microalgae cells. The transmission of Ca2+ signals in microalgae not only controls intracellular regulation but also regulates long-distance or even organic signal transmission and physiological responses Yang et al. 2022b . Heavy metals refer to metals with a density greater than 5 g cm3 including Cu Fe Zn Cd Cr etc. Microalgae have a variety of unique self-protection mechanisms to combat the toxicity of heavy metals such as heavy metal immobiliza tion gene regulation exclusion and chelation as well as antioxidants or reductases that reduce heavy metals through redox reactions. Micro algae can form cell protein-heavy metal complexes without changing their activity and organic metal complexes are further separated in the vacuole to help regulate the concentration of heavy metal ions in the cytoplasm thereby reducing their toxic effects. In addition heavy metals activate the biosynthesis of phytochelatins PCs thiol-rich peptides and proteins that interact with them to minimize the effects of heavy metals Leong and Chang 2020 . According to Fig. 1 the removal of heavy metal ions by microalgae includes two steps. The first step is to attach heavy metal ions to the cell surface called biosorption. Biosorption is a fast non-metabolic and reversible process that allows living and dead algae biomass to remove heavy metals mainly controlled by negatively charged functional groups on the cell wall. The negative charge on the cell surface is in that the presence of hydroxyl OH- carboxyl -COOH phosphate -PO4 amino -NH2 sulfhydryl -SH etc. which provides more binding sites for metal cations and al lows ion interaction. In addition to physical adsorption ion exchange chelation microprecipitation chemical adsorption and other phenom ena will also make heavy metal ions adhere to the cell surface. The second step is that heavy metals are internalized into cells through an energy-dependent process after being attached to cells which is called bioaccumulation . Since heavy metals are hydrophilic they require specific carrier molecules to allow them to enter the cell. Heavy metal ions are attached to the functional groups on the cell surface followed by intracellular bioaccumulation and compartmentalization of subcel lular organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria and ultimately detoxification by removing excess metals from the cells Tripathi and Poluri 2021 Kumar et al. 2015 . Most ions affect the growth and physiological metabolism of microalgae. The following introduces the effects of anions and cations on the growth of microalgae and the mechanism of physiological metabolism and further explains the effects of anions and cations on the physiology and biochemistry of microalgae. 2.2.1. Effect of anions on the growth of microalgae 2.2.1.1. HCO3 . Both inorganic carbon and organic carbon can be used to culture microalgae but CO2 in inorganic carbon is the main carbon source for culturing microalgae because CO2 is easier to obtain in the air. Microalgae require a certain concentration of CO2 during photosyn thesis so microalgae contain a CO2 concentration mechanism CCM to increase the concentration of CO2. CO2 in the air exists in the form of HCO3 CO3 2 and CO2 in the water. HCO3 can enter the cell through a series of transporters and is converted into CO2 by carbonic anhydrase CA to increase the concentration of CO2 around ribulose-1 5- bisphosphate carboxylase RuBisCO so that microalgae can effi ciently fix carbon and convert it into other organic matter such as car bohydrates and lipids. The utilization of these two carbons by microalgae is largely related to extracellular CA. CA is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of HCO3 to CO2. Only algae that can use HCO3 can express CA. CA catalyzes the continuous supply of HCO3 to CO2 to active transporters. The affinity of microalgae to HCO3 is higher than that of CO2 but the main carbon species entering the cytoplasm is CO2. The expression of exogenous CA is also greatly affected by pH and CO2 concentration Fal et al. 2023 Ighalo et al. H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 5 2022 Tarafdar et al. 2023 . CO2 and HCO3 are the main forms of ab sorption and fixation of microalgae cells. CO2 can be converted into HCO3 by alkaline solution as a carbon source for microalgae growth. This method eliminates the disadvantage of slow dissolution of CO2 and the supply of carbon sources is sufficient to meet the needs of rapid growth of microalgae. It has been reported that in some cases the car bon removal efficiency can reach more than 90 when microalgae is cultured in a solution containing bicarbonate ions while the carbon utilization rate is low when microalgae is cultured directly with CO2 Zhu et al. 2022 . Agbebi et al. 2022 studied that the use of bicar bonate solution as a carbon source and the regulation of the pH of the medium solution can increase the activity of RuBisCO and CA increase the content of chlorophyll a and increase the biomass of chlorella. Most inorganic carbon exists in the form of HCO3 at normal pH in microalgae culture. There are many known CO2 transport pathways in eukaryotic microalgae cells including CO2 diffusion and active transport of CO2 and HCO3 Zheng et al. 2018 . 2.2.1.2. PO4 3-. The absorption of phosphorus by microalgae is mainly based on inorganic phosphorus while inorganic phosphorus in water mainly exists as sulfate ions Miao et al. 2022 . Some microalgae can also utilize inorganic phosphorus IP and organic phosphorus OP at the same time. The enzyme systems contained in microalgae such as nuclease and alkaline phosphatase AKP have been shown to enable microalgae to utilize OP. AKP is considered to be the most common enzyme that uses OP which can decompose OP and release IP to pro mote the growth of microalgae Xing et al. 2023 . The absorption of phosphorus by microalgae includes two main processes extracellular adsorption and intracellular uptake. Extracellular adsorption mainly depends on extracellular polymeric substances EPS secreted by microalgae. EPS is located on the surface of microalgae cells and is mainly composed of proteins and carbohydrates. The positively charged amine group in EPS protein can be complex with negatively charged phosphate so that EPS has a strong adsorption capacity for phosphate. As the main extracellular phosphorus pool EPS plays a key role in phos phorus absorption. In addition phosphorus can be transported through the cell membrane and in contact with intracellular polymeric sub stances IPS which contain a variety of phosphorus-containing com pounds including phospholipids phosphorylated proteins nucleotides and polyphosphates. The absorption of intracellular phosphorus by IPS is mainly through biomass assimilation and polyphosphate formation. During the growth of microalgae IP can be transported to IPS for metabolism and converted into OP. When exposed to a continuous high phosphorus concentration in the external environment microalgae can absorb more phosphorus than required for cell metabolism and growth and excess phosphorus is stored in cells in the form of polyphosphate. The role of EPS and IPS in the process of phosphorus uptake by micro algae cannot be ignored Wu et al. 2021 . However the most common form of phosphorus in wastewater is phosphate ion which has high solubility and activity. It can be converted into H2PO4 HPO4 2 and then absorbed by microalgae through phosphorylation. It is found that microalgae can absorb phosphate ions in landfill leachate well for their growth. When phosphorus is sufficient phosphate ions enter cells through transporters and are involved in the synthesis of RNA DNA polyphosphates phospholipids proteins and adenosine triphosphate ATP . In the case of phosphorus deficiency excess phosphorus will accumulate in vacuoles in the form of acid-insoluble polyphosphate AISP and be stored in the form of polyphosphate particles for future internal use. After AISP is degraded into Pi it is used to transfer to its cellular phosphorus compounds to maintain the viability of microalgae under phosphorus deficiency Janpum et al. 2022 Su 2021 Khanzada 2020 . 2.2.1.3. NO3 . Nitrate is one of the most common water pollutants. To utilize nitrate ions microalgae must convert nitrate ions into ammo nium ions. The conversion process includes two steps that is NO3 is absorbed into the cell where it is reduced to NO2 by cytoplasmic nitrate reductase NR and NO2 is then transferred to the chloroplast where it is reduced to NH4 + by nitrite reductase NiR Dang et al. 2022 . Ni trogen sources have no inhibitory effect on microalgae in high concen trations of nitrate ions and microalgae have a better affinity for NO3 than NH4 + Praveen et al. 2018 . Fig. 2 shows the absorption principle of NO3 and NH4 + by microalgae and its advantages and disadvantages Qin et al. 2022 . 2.2.2. Effects of cations on the growth of microalgae 2.2.2.1. Cu2+. Cu is an essential nutrient for aquatic organisms and is of great significance to the photosynthesis of microalgae. The adsorption of Cu2+ by microalgae cell membrane is fast while the absorption of Cu2+ by microalgae cells is relatively slow. At low Cu2+ concentration the transport of copper ions will be limited by diffusion and the uptake of Cu2+ ions by microalgae will be controlled by kinetics. Once Cu2+ is internalized by microalgae thiol groups in the cytoplasm will be oxidized resulting in a decrease in the ratio of reducing and oxidizing glutathione which in turn affects spindle formation and cell division limiting cell growth. High concentrations of Cu2+ can inhibit the photosynthesis process induce oxidative stress inhibit the growth of Fig. 1. Adsorption of heavy metal elements by microalgae Tripathi and Poluri 2021 . H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 6 microalgae cells and even cause the death of microalgae cells mainly for two reasons i Causing changes in the chloroplast structure of microalgae ii Excessive Cu2+ replaces magnesium ions in chlorophyll molecules resulting in changes in fluorescence quantum yield and chlorophyll absorption spectra affecting the structure of chloroplasts thereby affecting photosynthetic efficiency reducing photosynthesis and reducing glucose synthesis efficiency Pascual et al. 2022 Li et al. 2021a Zhu et al. 2020 . 2.2.2.2. Fe2+ Fe3+. Fe is an important element required for the growth of microalgae. It is one of the elements involved in the enzymatic re action of photosynthesis in photosystem I PSI and photosystem II PSII . It is an essential trace element for microalgae growth nitrogen metabolism and chlorophyll synthesis. Fe deficiency will reduce the photosynthetic activity and growth rate of microalgae but a high con centration of Fe will also hurt microalgae. Studies have shown that Fe3+ concentration of 2 mg L has a positive effect on most microalgae but negative effects are usually observed when Fe3+ concentration exceeds 40 mg L. Fe2+ can change the lipid structure of microalgae. Lin et al. studied the effect of Fe2+ on the yield and composition of fatty acid methyl esters FAME in Scenedesmus rubescens-like microalgae. High or low Fe2+ concentration has a certain inhibitory effect on ammonia consumption and FAME accumulation. When the concentration of Fe2+ was 1 mg L the FAME yield of microalgae was the highest which had a significant impact on biodiesel production. In the case of low Fe con centration microalgae adapt to the absorption of Fe and show a high affinity for Fe ions. Compared with Fe3+ the bioavailability of Fe2+ is lower Polat et al. 2020 Lin et al. 2012 . Although Fe is essential for all aerobic organisms a large amount of Fe2+ is toxic because a large number of H2O2 and Fe2+ spontaneously reacts in cells called Fenton s reaction producing a large amount of OH and Fe3+ causing changes in the valence state of Fe resulting in increased reactive oxygen species ROS which in turn harms microalgae cells Zada et al. 2021 Carb o et al. 2023 . Fe has been shown to promote the expression of specific genes including enzymes related to lipid synthesis. When microalgae grow under high Fe concentration conditions significant overexpression of genes related to metabolic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACCase and ribulose triphosphate carboxylase NTPase involved in lipid syn thesis can be observed Concas et al. 2021 . 2.2.2.3. Zn2+. Zn is an enzyme cofactor of RNA polymerase RNAP superoxide dismutase SOD and CA in microalgae. The change in Zn2+ concentration will affect the fatty acid content and the accumulation of protein and chlorophyll in microalgae. Zn2+ can also replace magnesium ions in chlorophyll thereby changing the composition of chlorophyll and inhibiting photosynthesis. High concentrations of Zn2+ can affect the content of glutathione GSH and malondialdehyde MDA and the activity of SOD in microalgae thus affecting the biomass production and nutrient removal ability of microalgae. Koppel et al. 2019 studied the absorption of metal elements by two Antarctic marine microalgae cells. When the concentration of other metal ions is constant the intracellular zinc concentration of the two microalgae is positively correlated with the growth rate indicating that the increase of intracellular zinc con centration will increase the growth rate Li et al. 2022a . Zhou et al. 2018 studied the effect of Zn2+ concentration on the growth biochemical composition and photosynthetic performance of Spirulina platensis. The results showed that Zn2+ could destroy the uptake of cal cium by microalgae and calcium was an essential element for adenosine triphosphatase activity in cell division. The toxicity of Zn2+ could also destroy the structure of proteins in microalgae cells. The direct binding of Zn to thiols is an important detoxification mechanism which can protect sensitive cell sites from metal stress by acting as a buffer for excessive metal leading to the active accumulation of metal in cells. Li et al. 2023 studied the accumulation and detoxification mechanism of Zn2+ in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and found that Zn2+ was mainly adsorbed on the binding sites of cell wall and EPS when the concen tration was lower than 3 mg L. When the concentration was higher than 3 mg L intracellular GSH was synthesized in large quantities Fig. 2. The absorption principle of NO3 and NH4 + by microalgae and its advantages and disadvantages Qin et al. 2022 . H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 7 scavenging H2O2 O2 and organic free radicals and transported to vesicles to offset the toxicity of Zn2+. 2.2.2.4. Cd2+. Cd is a non-essential toxic element for microalgae. The negative groups such as phosphoric acid on the surface of microalgae cells complex with free Cd2+ and then microalgae metabolize phos phorus free radicals into the extracellular microenvironment and combine with complexed Cd2+ to form a stable phosphate precipitate. The CH C O and COO in the aliphatic groups of lipids or proteins and carboxylates and the -PO4 P O and P OH in the free phosphate groups of phosphates and phospholipids can all be complexed with Cd2+ Xia et al. 2023 . Liu et al. 2023 studied the mechanism of pollutant removal and the toxic reaction of tetrabromobisphenol A and Cd2+ on Chlorella sorokiniana indicating that Cd2+ below 1 mg L can promote the growth of microalgae and Cd2+ can up-regulate DNA replication-related genes in microalgae thereby promoting cell prolif eration. The addition of Cd2+ can stimulate the photosynthesis of microalgae which provides a basis for the production of poly saccharides. The reducing end of the polysaccharide can act on free radicals to produce antioxidant activity. At the same time the hydroxyl group in the polysaccharide has a high affinity for divalent cations and can bind to Cd2+ to reduce the damage of Cd2+ to cells. Cd can easily bind to sulfhydryl carboxyl and phosphate functional groups in the cell membrane of microalgae thereby generating a net negative charge on the surface of microalgae cells. Cd2+ is transported in cells through ion channels or transporters that are constitutively present on the cell membrane. Tripathi et al. 2023 studied the physiological and biochemical effects of cadmium on cadmium-tolerant microalgae Sce nedesmus sp. IITRIND2 . Studies have shown that cadmium can increase the production of microalgae lipids and EPS. However excessive con centration of cadmium will change the physiological activity of micro algae cells resulting in inhibition of growth and damage to photosynthesis. The main functional groups of microalgae in the process of Cd2+ adsorption were determined to include OH C O CH CH2 -P O PO4 3 and PO4. Among them the phosphate groups PO4 -P O and phosphate PO4 3 play a major role in improving the adsorption capacity of microalgae for Cd2+ Wang et al. 2021 . 2.2.2.5. Cr3+ Cr6+. Cr mainly exists in three main forms in nature uncharged metal form Cr trivalent form Cr3+ and hexavalent form Cr6+ Hedayatkhah et al. 2018 . Cr6+ is more toxic than Cr3+. The removal of Cr by microalgae cells is not only through adsorption but also through biological mechanisms such as the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ by enzymes to reduce toxicity. GSH released by Chlorella under Cr6+ stress will reduce Cr6+ to Cr3+. Most of the Cr6+ in microalgae cells is accu mulated through organelles heat-stable proteins HSPs and particles Daneshvar et al. 2019 . Studies have shown that microalgae can not only produce sufficient biomass and accumulate a large amount of lipids under Cr stress but also repair hexavalent chromium at a toxic concen tration 1 mg L in the human body Hedayatkhah et al. 2018 . Kafil et al. 2022 showed that Chlorella can change the composition and content of FAME in microalgae under Cr6+ stress to improve the quality of biodiesel. When low concentrations of heavy metals such as trivalent chromium and hexavalent chromium are added to the medium micro algae cells will have a toxic excitatory effect which will interfere with the homeostasis of microalgae and initiate a series of repair and main tenance mechanisms. For example through the activation of transcrip tion factors and kinases the expression of cytoprotective and repair proteins is increased but as the concentration increases the growth of microalgae is limited or dead. In summary low concentrations of heavy metals can be absorbed and utilized by microalgae participate in the synthesis of enzymes and proteins related to microalgae cells and pro mote the growth and metabolism of microalgae while high concentra tions of heavy metals can seriously threaten the growth of microalgae cells and even lead to death. 2.2.2.6. Mg2+. Mg is an essential element for the growth and develop ment of microalgae. It is the most abundant free cation in the cytoplasm. It is the core atom of the chlorophyll skeleton molecule of microalgae and controls the activity of several photosynthetic enzymes. Each chlorophyll molecule requires one Mg2+ to synthesize which is essential for the formation of chlorophyll. And many enzymes such as RNA po lymerase ATPase protein kinase phosphatase glutathione synthase and carboxylase require Mg2+ to function. Mg deficiency in microalgae hinders cell division and chlorophyll synthesis. Mg deficiency leads to a significant decrease in photosynthetic rate which ultimately damages cell growth. In addition Mg is a cofactor of malic enzyme which can convert malic acid into pyruvate in the transfer dehydrogenase cycle providing essential NADPH for lipid accumulation during fatty acid synthesis. Therefore Mg2+ promotes the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae Daneshvar et al. 2018 Kong et al. 2020 . Salman et al. 2023 studied the effect of Mg2+ concentration on the biomass and physiological changes of Chlorella vulgaris 5 mg L Mg2+ was the optimal concentration for biomass production and 15 mg L Mg2+ was the optimal concentration for protein and carbohydrate production. The bioaccumulation mechanism of Mg2+ is the result of the interaction of the metabolic process and the mass transfer process. Hydrodynamics controls the external transport of Mg2+ from solvent to microalgae while cell physiology and their growth limitations control biochemical processes. Environmental stress such as a high concentration of Mg2+ induces the production of excessive ROS and activates a series of anti oxidants to defend against ROS by oxidizing cellular components such as SOD which acts on the detoxification of ROS. Esakkimuthu et al. 2016 studied that the growth of Scenedesmus obliquus was stagnant at about 0.8 g L when the concentration of Mg2+ was 150 mg L and above. Although the growth rate did not increase significantly in the case of excessive Mg2+ supply the lipid content of Scenedesmus obliquus changed dramatically with the change of Mg2+ supply which was more than 3 times higher than that of the control group. 2.2.2.7. Ca2+. There are two sources of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of microalgae. One is that extracellular Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm through transporters on the cell membrane and the other is that Ca2+ in the intracellular calcium pool is released into the cytoplasm. Ca2+ can participate in the composition of cell structure and can also be used as a signal molecule to participate in the biotic and abiotic stress responses of cells. Calmodulin CaM calcineurin B-like protein CBL and calcium- dependent protein kinase CDPK are three types of Ca2+ sensors which can bind Ca2+ to regulate a series of downstream physiological and metabolic activities. Ca2+ directly activates NADPH oxidase to produce ROS by binding to the enzyme. In addition Ca2+ and CaM complexes activate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase NAD ki nase and further provide substrates to NADPH oxidase resulting in increased NADPH content. On the other hand ROS can regulate Ca2+ in the cytoplasm by activating calcium channels. In plants there is a crosstalk between ROS and calcium signaling pathways in response to different environmental stresses and different stimuli induce cells to produce different Ca2+ signals. Yang et al. 2022b studied that Ca2+ was involved in the regulation of TAG metabolism in microalgae under heat stress. Ca2+ entered microalgae cells through channel proteins promoted the expression of CaM and CDPK genes and then activated downstream transcription factors to promote the synthesis of TAG in microalgae cells. Ca2+ can up-regulate the activity of intracellular antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and peroxidase POD and alleviate excessive ROS by activating Ca2+ signal transduction. In addition calcium-regulated cyclic electron flows not only effectively reduce the damage of ROS to the photosynthetic system but also provide ATP for the biosynthesis of TAG Zhang et al. 2017 Shim et al. 2020 . Tang et al. 2022 studied the effect of Ca2+ on the performance growth and extracellular properties of microalgae-bacterial symbiotic systems for wastewater treatment and showed that Ca2+ content also significantly H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 8 affected the growth of microalgae. Low concentration of Ca2+ can pro mote the growth of microalgae and the removal of pollutants in water. The presence of Ca2+ can improve extracellular secretions and promote flocculation performance but it also leads to a decrease in the removal rate of pollutants in water. 3. Efficient lipid production of microalgae 3.1. Lipid production mechanism of microalgae Lipids in microalgae can be divided into polar and non-polar types. Polar lipids are mainly some lipids that constitute cell structure such as phospholipids and sterols are the main components of cell membranes and some polar lipids play a key role in signaling pathways as in termediates or precursors such as inositol lipids and sphingolipids. Non- polar lipids are mainly storage lipids most of which exist in microalgae in the form of TAG Sibi et al. 2016 . Microalgae with a high content of non-polar lipids were selected as candidates for biodiesel production. Lipid metabolism of microalgae is a complex project involving multiple enzymes Xie et al. 2020 including glycolysis TAC cycle β-oxidation and other physiological and biochemical processes which generally include lipid synthesis carbon chain extension liposome transport storage and so on. Fig. 3 shows the metabolic pathway of lipids in microalgae. At present it is believed that TAG synthesis in microalgae is mainly completed on the chloroplast membrane and endoplasmic re ticulum that is FFA are synthesized in the chloroplast and then the FFA are transported to the cytoplasm to further synthesize TAG on the endoplasmic reticulum. The main sites of fatty acid synthesis are chlo roplasts. First acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by ACCase to form Malonyl-CoA and then transferred to the fatty acid synthesis pathway FAS to form C16 and C18 long chains after many cycles Ananthi et al. 2021b . The acyl chain is then cut off by related enzymes to release the fatty acids and transfer them to the endoplasmic reticulum for further processing. The production and transfer of acetyl-CoA is A key regulatory step in the fatty acid synthesis and oxidation process and ACCase is a key rate-limiting enzyme in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and plays an important role in controlling lipid synthesis. Under nutritional restric tion or environmental stress half of the total lipid content is synthesized de novo while the rest of the accumulated lipids are produced from the recycling of existing fatty acids Chowdhury et al. 2019 . The synthesis site of TAG is mainly the endoplasmic reticulum and the synthesis pathway of TAG is mainly formed by the Kennedy pathway. The carbon-chain fatty acyl-Coenzyme A Acyl-CoA and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase GPAT are the most important precursors which undergo a series of transformations to form TAG after being utilized by multiple acyltransferases Chhandama et al. 2021 . The mechanism of microalgae accumulation of lipids is to convert CO2 into microalgae s biomass through microalgae photosynthesis thus fixing carbon elements and then converting microalgae s carbon sub stances into lipids through induced reactions. All kinds of environmental stress and genetic metabolism regulation can promote the production and accumulation of TAG in microalgae. These stresses lead to a meta bolic imbalance in microalgae cells inhibit most of the basic metabolic processes and activate the expression of lipid metabolism synthesis pathways and related enzymes Xing et al. 2021 . In this chapter various stress regulation methods used by microalgae will be reviewed to achieve efficient lipid production of microalgae. 3.2. Method of efficient lipid production by microalgae Microalgae is considered to be the most promising raw material for biodiesel production because of its rapid growth rate and efficient lipid accumulation ability. Environmental stress and genetic metabolic regulation have been used to increase the lipid content of microalgae during the culture stage. Environmental stress such as nutrient limita tion light intensity temperature pH and CO2 can accumulate lipids and multiple coupling environmental stress can also better increase lipid accumulation. The stress of environmental factors slowed down cell proliferation which could be replaced by the two-stage culture method and the biomass and lipid content could be improved. Although envi ronmental stress is a simple and effective way to promote lipid pro duction and accumulation a large number of studies on genetic and metabolic regulation such as genetic engineering have the unique ability to precisely control the targeting mechanism in cells to induce increased lipid accumulation. 3.2.1. Environmental factor stress 3.2.1.1. Nutrient limitation. Nutrient limitation is considered to be an effective strategy for microalgae lipid production. The provision of nu trients such as N P C Mg Ca and Fe to the microalgae culture medium is an important nutrient for the metabolic pathways related to micro algae cell division growth photosynthesis and lipid accumulation Liyanaarachchi et al. 2020 . Mg contributes to the synthesis of plant Fig. 3. Mechanism of intracellular lipid accumulation in microalgae Khoo et al. 2023 . H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 9 proteins which constitute a part of certain enzymes such as enzymes involved in carbon fixation and metabolism during photosynthesis. Mg acts as an enzyme activator such as activating ACCase an enzyme that promotes fatty acid biosynthesis Srinuanpan et al. 2018 . Ca is an integral part of the cell wall and cell membrane structure which pro motes coordination between cells and environmental stimuli by acting as an intracellular messenger Esakkimuthu et al. 2016 . N and phos phorus P are the main elements of ribose protein and DNA in cells. N and phosphorus P deficiency can seriously affect intracellular meta bolism. Under nutrient deficiency or limitation conditions microalgae accumulate more lipids and carbohydrates to cope with adverse envi ronments and the degradation of nitrogen-containing compounds such as chlorophyll and protein leads to more carbon and energy available for lipid accumulation Shi et al. 2020 . P affects the carbon flow be tween starch and lipid synthesis pathways by inhibiting the activity of ADP glucan pyrophosphorylase AGPase a key enzyme in the first step of starch synthesis Shahid et al. 2020 . Srinuanpan et al. 2018 studied the effect of nutrient limitation on the lipid content of two microalgae. When P was limited the lipid content of Scenedesmus obli quus SIT06 and Micractinium reisseri SIT04 was 40.3 and 30.5 respectively. When N was limited the lipid content increased signifi cantly reaching 56.8 and 36.6 respectively. It is worth noting that N limitation can better increase the lipid content of microalgae than P limitation. Omar Faruque et al. 2020 showed that the increase in the C N ratio in algal cells under N stress reduced protein synthesis and carbon was stored as intracellular carbohydrates and lipids. Lipid accumulation in algal cells under N stress activated the activity of acetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA carboxylase to recalibrate the distribution of starch and lipids. Dong et al. 2020 found that algae cells preferentially synthesize starch. With the prolongation of stress time starch gradually degrades and the degraded carbon skeleton is mainly used for lipid synthesis. Microalgae tend to synthesize neutral lipids to produce energy to reduce oxidative damage caused by stress conditions. 3.2.1.2. Light conditions. As a photosynthetic autotrophic organism light plays a key role in the growth biochemical composition and lipid accumulation of microalgae. In the photoreaction stage of photosyn thesis microalgae use light to decompose water into oxygen protons and electrons. In the dark reaction stage protons and electrons are used to reduce CO2 to starch through the Calvin cycle. Starch can be decomposed and metabolized to form fatty acids and TAG Khoo et al. 2023 . The light-driven photooxidation process is directly related to carbon fixation through the Calvin cycle. Higher light intensity produces more heat dissipation. When the optimal irradiance is achieved any further increase in light intensity will damage microalgae cells for photoinhibition. The optimal light intensity for the growth of most microalgae is in the range of 200 400 μmol m2 s Shekh et al. 2022 . Photorespiration is related to the oxygenase activity of the RuBisCO enzyme. Under strong light the accumulation of oxygen O2 will lead to an increase in the local O2 CO2 ratio thereby reducing the activity of carboxylase and increasing the activity of oxygenase. Excessive elec trons are generated in photosystem II that react with the oxygen pro duced by photosynthesis leading to the formation of oxygen free radicals which affect the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae Sousa et al. 2012 . Light is the energy source required for the photo synthesis of microalgae. Light intensity wavelength and photoperiod are important parameters for optimization to increase lipid content. Chin et al. 2023 optimized the light intensity nitrogen concentration and culture volume parameters to improve the lipid content of micro algae. Under the optimized conditions of light intensity of 135 μmol m2 s nitrogen concentration of 5 g L and culture volume of 5 L it was found that Chaetoceros muelleri and Isochrysis galbana produced up to 43.4 dry weight lipid content and required fatty acid characteris tics including high concentrations of saturated fatty acids and mono unsaturated fatty acids of which oleic acid ratio was as high as 27.7 which was selected as a promising candidate for microalgae biodiesel. Ren et al. 2020 studied the effects of different light sources on the growth and lipid accumulation of Scenedesmus sp. When the photoperiod was 6 18 h the biomass concentration was 3.2 g L and the lipid content was as high as 40.3 . Sirisuk et al. 2018 studied the effects of wavelength stress on the biomass and lipid content of three microalgae using blue green and red light-emitting diodes LEDs . After green LED irradiation the maximum lipid content of Nannochloropsis salina Iso chrysis galbana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum reached 49.4 63.3 and 62.0 of dry weight respectively. 3.2.1.3. Temperature. Temperature affects the photosynthetic rate growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae. Below the optimum growth temperature temperature increase has a positive effect on photosynthesis and cell division. If the temperature change exceeds the optimal range it may lead to overgrowth inhibition or death of microalgae cells. Different microalgae have different tolerance ranges to temperature. The thermophilic microalgae growing on the wooden structure of the cooling tower of the thermal power plant in central Mexico can survive at temperatures up to 40 C based on the heat- resistant molecules that make up their cells and their metabolism is based on heat-stable enzymes Covarrubias et al. 2016 . Higher tem peratures increase the production of biomass especially carbohydrates and lipids which may be related to the involvement of the thermophilic enzyme system in sucrose production while lower temperatures generally reduce the activity of carboxylases. Most microalgae survive at an ideal temperature of 20 30 C Barati et al. 2019 . Converti et al. 2009 studied the effects of temperature and nitrogen concentration on the lipid content of Nannochloropsis oculata and Chlorella vulgaris. When the temperature increased from 20 C to 25 C the lipid content of N. oculata increased from 7.9 to 14.9 and when the temperature increased from 25 C to 30 C the lipid content of C. vulgaris decreased from 14.7 to 5.9 . When the nitrogen concentration in the medium was reduced by 75 the lipid content of N. oculata and C. vulgaris increased by 2 3 times. Chaisutyakorn et al. 2018 studied the effect of temperature on the lipid content of marine microalgae Chaetoceros sp. FIKU035 Tetraselmis suecica FIKU032 and Nannochloropsis sp. FIKU036 which were cultured at different temperatures of 25 40 C. The results showed that the lipid content of all microalgae decreased with the in crease in temperature. The lipid content of marine microalgae FIKU035 was as high as 66.7 1.3 mg L day and 61.4 2.9 mg L day at 25 C and 30 C. Temperature determines the activity of enzymes and enzyme activity is the key to regulating lipid accumula tion. Therefore culture temperature has a direct impact on microalgae lipid production Sachdeva et al. 2016 . 3.2.1.4. pH. The pH affects many physiological mechanisms related to the growth and metabolism lipid accumulation and ion absorption of micro algae cells Khalil et al. 2010 . The pH determines the solubility and availability of CO2 and other essential nutrients as well as the ac tivity of intracellular and cell wall-related enzymes Juneja et al. 2013 . In the closed medium the pH fluctuates during the day and night. The consumption of bicarbonate and CO2 by photosynthesis during the day will make the pH of the medium alkaline while the CO2 produced during night respiration will make the pH acidic. Acidic pH interferes with cell nutrient absorption and cell meta bolism. Alkaline pH reduces the affinity of microalgae to CO2 in creases the flexibility of the mother cell delays the completion of the cell cycle and interferes with the cell division process Vadlamani et al. 2017 . Owing to the sensitivity of photosynthetic organs and related enzymes to extreme pH conditions deviating from the optimal pH will affect photosynthetic efficiency and it is crucial to maintain the pH of the culture within the optimal range. Most H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 10 microalgae species grow best near neutral pH 7.0 7.6 but algae such as Chlorella can survive in a wide pH range Juneja et al. 2013 . Song et al. 2023a found that the microalgae strain Parachlorella kessleri R-3 can accumulate a large amount of biomass and lipids in a wide pH range of 3 11 and the pH of the medium can be gradually adjusted to near neutral during culture. Under the initial pH of 7 the maximum biomass of microalgae was 6.9 g L the lipid content was 45.1 and the lipid productivity was 340.9 mg L day. The change in pH of the medium will change the lipid accumulation of micro algae. Compared with the lipid content of the control group at pH 7.0 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii showed higher lipid accumulation at pH 7.8 which was three times that of the control group Ochoa-Al faro et al. 2019 . 3.2.1.5. CO2. Among the atmospheric pollutants CO2 is considered to be the most important one that causes the greenhouse effect. Microalgae can absorb the largest environmental perpetrator CO2 in the culture process to combat climate change which makes microalgae the best candidate for biodiesel production Tarafdar et al. 2023 . Like all plants CO2 affects the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae by affecting photosynthesis. Microalgae can use solar energy to combine water with CO2 to produce biomass. Similar to the optimal light in tensity and temperature there is an optimal CO2 concentration which is beneficial to the metabolic activity growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae. Microalgae need an appropriate amount of dissolved CO2 during the growth process. For photosynthetic microalgae CO2 ensures the carbon supply of photosynthesis Barati et al. 2022 . Mohsenpour and Willoughby 2016 studied the effect of the combination of blue light and 15 CO2 on the lipid content of microalgae. When the CO2 ventilation increased from 5 to 15 the lipid content of microalgae increased by six times. Khan et al. 2022 found that total lipid content increased from 8.0 to 22.0 of dry biomass under 15 CO2 venti lation. Too little CO2 will lead to lipid reduction over slow metabolism and too much CO2 will cause damage to the growth and lipid production of microalgae. This is because the unused CO2 in the culture will be converted into carbonic acid H2CO3 reducing the pH of the culture resulting in acidification of the medium and changing cell growth and metabolic pathways Sibi et al. 2016 . Faruque et al. 2020 studied the changes in lipids in Scenedesmus dimorphus under CO2 concentration and N P ratio. When the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus N P was 1 1 6 CO2 was introduced. The maximum lipid content was 31.6 of biomass dry weight. The results showed that the lipid accumulation in micro algae biomass could be increased by a favorable NP ratio and appro priate CO2 supplement. With the continuous increase of global CO2 emissions we must combine CO2 to cultivate microalgae. Microalgae transform into high-value compounds by absorbing carbon sources and ultimately achieve a win-win goal of protecting the environment and high biomass content. 3.2.1.6. Salinity stress. Salt is involved in the physiological and biochemical pathways of microalgae growth reproduction and fatty acid metabolism. Appropriate salt addition will increase the lipid con tent of microalgae Pei et al. 2022 . Salt stress causes osmotic pressure differences in microalgae cells causing stress response and forcing microalgae to adapt to new environments and change their metabolism. At the same time salt stress also affects the oxidative stress and fatty acid metabolism mechanism of microalgae cells thereby increasing lipid accumulation Elloumi et al. 2020 Song et al. 2022a . Teh et al. 2021 pointed out that the addition of an appropriate amount of NaCl could promote lipid accumulation in microalgae. When the salinity increases from 5 to 30 ppt the carbon distribution may be transferred from starch to lipid synthesis. Under high salt stress lipid content increased and starch and protein content decreased which was due to the up-regulation of ACCase the key enzyme responsible for lipid synthesis and the down-regulation of AGPase the key enzyme responsible for starch synthesis . Lipid content increased first and then decreased and lipid content reached a maximum of 63.5 at a salinity of 15 ppt. Another study Can et al. 2016 also found that with the increase in NaCl concentration lipid production first increased and then decreased and reached a peak at 2.75 M NaCl with a lipid production rate of 39.7 4.5 . Pancha et al. 2015 studied the physiological and biochemical changes of microalgae Scenedesmus sp. CCNM 1077 induced by salt stress. In the single-stage culture process when 33 mM NaCl was added the lipid content was 33.1 . In the two-stage culture process compared with the single stage 400 mM NaCl stress for 3 days resulted in 24.8 lipid containing 74.9 neutral lipid and higher biomass. In future research we can try to use the medium configured by seawater to cultivate freshwater algae because the ocean accounts for the vast majority of the world. Seawater contains a large amount of NaCl and has high salinity which is used to stress the cultivation of freshwater algae to observe growth and oil production. 3.2.1.7. Heavy metal stress. Microalgae has a great ability to absorb heavy metals. Low concentrations of heavy metals have a great impact on the physiological and biochemical processes of microalgae such as growth photosynthesis lipid content and fatty acid composition. Heavy metals may induce the formation of ROS resulting in oxidative damage to proteins lipids and thiol peptides and activate the antioxidant system Xing et al. 2023 activate the protective mechanism of microalgae change the activity of reactive oxygen scavenging enzymes and the ac tivity of enzymes related to secondary metabolites such as increasing TAG to protect microalgae cells from oxidative damage Aravind et al. 2022 . Some heavy metals such as Cu Zn Fe Mn Ni and Cr affect the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae cells. Xie et al. 2021 found that metal ions can affect the growth rate and lipid content of microalgae such as trace element Fe3+ which can participate in the enzymatic reaction of photosynthesis. Mg2+ affects various key meta bolic processes and physiological pathways of microalgae and is an important component of chlorophyll structure. Cu and zinc Zn are the most abundant heavy metals found in industrial wastewater Martí nez-Macias et al. 2019 . Hamed et al. 2022 Chlorella sorokiniana and Scenedesmus acuminatus added Cu2+ and Zn2+ to the culture medium respectively the lipid content increased and the removal rate of Cu2+ and Zn2+ also increased. Song et al. 2023b studied the cell growth lipid production and Cr6+ removal of Parachlorella kessleri R-3 at pH 3.5 and 15 C. It was found that a low concentration of Cr6+ 0.5 2 mg L promoted the growth of algae and higher than 5 mg L of Cr6+ inhibited the growth. The lipid content reached a maximum of 61.0 at 5 mg L Cr6+ and the removal efficiency of Cr6+ was the highest at 0.5 mg L Cr6+ treatment reaching 91.0 . It showed that microalgae were suit able as heavy metal adsorbents and raw materials for biodiesel pro duction. Dammak et al. 2022 added different concentrations of toxic metals such as Ni Cr and Co to the medium of Tetraselmis sp. and studied the effects of these metals on lipid synthesis by binary mixed design. The results showed that in the optimal binary mixture of 6 mg L Ni 54.5 and Cr 45.5 the lipid content reached up to 31.0 of the cell s dry weight. However high concentrations of heavy metals can also lead to adverse consequences such as the production of reactive oxygen species. Negative effects such as inhibition of chlorophyll syn thesis and enzyme activity Song et al. 2022b . 3.2.2. Genetic and metabolic regulation The above environmental factor stress has been shown to promote lipid accumulation in microalgae but it also brings many drawbacks such as slowing cell proliferation and inaccurate regulation to increase lipid content. Genetic and metabolic regulation may solve this problem. At present a large number of techniques such as genetic modification and metabolic regulation engineering are being studied for this appli cation. They have the unique ability to accurately control the targeting mechanism in cells to induce increased lipid accumulation without H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 11 affecting other changes Mulgund 2022 . Using the understanding of lipid metabolism pathways they are manipulated to produce valuable molecules such as overexpressing important rate-limiting enzymes in lipid metabolism or controlling lipid synthesis with the help of genetic engineering. 3.2.2.1. Microalgae-bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes with small size simple structure rapid metabolism and rapid reproduction which are widely distributed in land sea and lakes Yu et al. 2022 . There are many relationships between bacteria and microalgae in aquatic envi ronments including mutual benefit symbiosis and parasitism. Bacteria can produce nutrients CO2 and other substances by decomposing organic matter in the environment which can be utilized by microalgae. Microalgae produce oxygen through photosynthesis for bacterial con sumption thus forming a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. The low efficiency of the traditional microalgae monoculture lipid production process limits the development of microalgae biodiesel. Microalgae-bacteria consortium can not only produce a large amount of biomass and lipids but bacteria can greatly increase the biomass and lipid productivity of microalgae through carbon exchange Chen et al. 2019 . Zhao et al. 2014 used landfill leachate to culture a high-density microalgae-bacteria consortium. Up to 90.0 of total nitrogen in landfill leachate was removed and the maximum lipid productivity and carbon fixation were 24.1 mg L day and 65.8 mg L day respectively. Zhou et al. 2020 screened highly efficient heterotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria FN5 from urban sewage treatment systems which had the best effect on promoting the growth of lipid-rich micro algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa . The biomass and lipid content were 14.8 and 13.6 higher than those in the blank control experiment without FN5 respectively. The biomass and lipid content of microalgae reached 0.4 g L and 39.0 respectively after the Chlorella pyrenoidosa-FN5 consortium was cultured in urban sewage. Gao et al. 2022 studied a new type of microalgae-bacteria coupled reactor that combines acid-producing fermentation and microalgae culture for microalgae mariculture and wastewater treatment. Volatile fatty acids VFAs pro duced in the dark chamber are migrated to the light chamber for microalgae utilization thereby alleviating the feedback inhibition of pH drop and acid-producing fermentation. In the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ko00061 under mixed nutrient culture conditions three high-abundance acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes and eight downstream functional genes were up-regulated which contributed to fatty acid production and TAG synthesis. Shen et al. 2022 studied the co-culture of three microalgae and three bacteria with different inoculation ratios. The results showed that the best promotion effect was 1 1 co-culture of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Rhodobacter capsulatus and its lipid produc tivity was 2.8 times that of the control group. Stable isotope labeling proteomics iTRAQ analysis showed that light and bacteria PSB played a positive role in the TCA cycle and uronic acid cycle of micro algae but the utilization of CO2 and photosynthesis decreased indi cating that PSB promoted the metabolism of organic carbon utilization and weakened the utilization of inorganic carbon in microalgae. Microalgae-bacteria symbiosis can not only enhance the growth and lipid production of microalgae but also promote the removal and transformation of nutrients. 3.2.2.2. Genetic engineering. Microalgae use sunlight as an energy source for metabolism and synthesize and accumulate lipids by using atmospheric CO2 as a carbon source. Unfortunately microalgae lipid productivity is very low and usually accumulates in the cytoplasm which requires the use of genetic engineering to enhance microalgae lipid synthesis. Genetic engineering such as gene overexpression and mutation breeding can improve the defects of slow growth low lipid content and poor environmental adaptability of wild-type microalgae to improve the feasibility of biodiesel production from microalgae. Table 1 shows the application of genetic engineering to lipid production in microalgae. The expression and non-expression of various lipid synthesis-related genes can increase the lipid production level of microalgae Brar et al. 2021 . Lin et al. 2018 showed that the exog enous MLCA gene i.e. 678 bp with the highest catalytic activity was applied to overexpress in Chlorella vulgaris and the biomass protein content and lipid accumulation of the algae were increased. The lipid content reached 1.1 g L which was 2.2 times that of the wild type and accelerated carbon capture and fixation. Genetic changes in microalgae may contribute to the development of high-yield oleaginous strains but they have some disadvantages such as high production costs low suc cess rate of transformation and unstable genetic characteristics Alishah Aratboni et al. 2019 . Transcriptional regulation is another way to in crease microalgae lipids. Just as the co-expression of multiple enzymes involved in lipid synthesis can increase lipid accumulation transcrip tional regulation can lead to the control of metabolic flux because transcription factors can control multiple regulatory points in targeted metabolic pathways. For example the first key step in fatty acid biosynthesis is the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA catalyzed by ACCase Su et al. 2023 . These successes demonstrate the potential of genetic engineering in lipid production but the unknown threat makes the transition from laboratory to commercial genetic engineering more challenging than it seems. Because the environmental impact is uncertain it is a great risk to release genetically modified microalgae into the outdoor environment. Therefore we must establish a compre hensive process to analyze the potential threat of microalgae genetic engineering to humans and the natural environment so that we can have a more in-depth study of this. 3.2.2.3. Microbial contamination. The combined culture of microalgae and microbial systems can not only produce more biomass and lipids but also consume more nutrients to better treat wastewater. The study of Table 1 Application of genetic engineering to lipid production in microalgae. Species Genetic engineering Performance Reference Chlorella pyrenoidosa Differentially expressed genes were up-regulated under the action of plant hormones Lipid content was 3.7 times that of the control Yang et al. 2023a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CRISPRi-mediated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase CrPEPC1 mutant gene Lipid yield was increased by 94.2 4.2 compared with wild-type Kao and Ng 2017 Chlorella pyrenoidosa Mutant mutagenized by ARTP atmospheric and room temperature plasma . Lipid productivity was increased by 16.9 and showed good genetic stability Cao et al. 2017 Chlorella pyrenoidosa 60Co-γ irradiation mutagenesis Lipid content increased by 20.8 and high saturated fatty acid contenta Wang et al. 2018 Chlorella Vulgaris Cas9 with sgRNA designed on omega-3 fatty acid desaturase fad3 gene Lipid productivity was up to 46.0 compared with the control group Lin and Ng 2020 Nannochloropsis gaditana Homolog of fungal Zn II 2Cys6-encoding genes Lipid content was increased by a factor of 2 and the growth was not affected Ajjawi et al. 2017 Nannochloropsis oceanica The bZIP-family regulator NobZIP77 enhances the transcription of diacylglyceryl acyltransferase genes in the absence of nitrogen Lipid production doubled compared to the control groupa Zhang et al. 2022a a The experimental values of all experiments were very similar with no signif icant difference p-values for 98.0 Ahmed et al. 2023 . Cost-benefit analysis shows that the use of nanoparticles may reduce the overall production cost of microalgae biodiesel by 2.5 4 times which improves the prospects of the commercial feasibility of a microalgae biodiesel system based on nanotechnology Rana and Pra japati 2022 . Nowadays magnetic nano-catalysts are more popular than bulk nano-catalysts for their advantages of no mass transfer resis tance fast deactivation and high recovery rate in the separation process. Functionalized magnetic nano-catalysts are more attractive for biodiesel production. Further research and development of nano-catalysts with high activity and selectivity for industrial scale should be carried out. 4.5. Preparation of microalgae biodiesel by non-catalytic reaction In the process of microalgae biodiesel production the addition of catalysts has brought many disadvantages to us. It is necessary to develop a new process that allows simultaneous treatment of microalgae biomass without using catalysts. The emerging process method that meets all the above standards is the supercritical method. The super critical process fluid has high diffusion and dissolution ability at high temperatures and pressure to convert lipids into biodiesel in one step without using catalysts which greatly reduces the energy consumption of the process. Another emerging process is the ILs method. ILs have a large number of anion and cation combinations which have the ad vantages of relatively high chemical and thermal stability non- flammability low volatility low melting point and recyclability and are called green solvents . ILs can dissolve stubborn biopolymers by destroying the hydrogen bonds of lignin and cellulose in the cell wall and catalyze to increase biodiesel yield. In contrast the supercritical method and the ionic liquid method simplify the product purification stage and are more environmentally friendly. 4.5.1. Preparation of microalgae biodiesel by supercritical method The traditional process is energy-consuming and costly requiring a long reaction time and additional catalyst separation and recovery steps. In addition the disposal of the catalyst is also harmful to the environ ment. Therefore Kusdiana and Saka introduced a supercritical trans esterification process for the synthesis of biodiesel. Supercritical fluids are fluids whose temperature and pressure are above their critical points. These fluids have high diffusivity and solubility and their den sity can be adjusted by changing temperature and pressure. The main advantages of the supercritical process are i High temperature and high pressure 240 290 C and 9.3 30 MPa successfully destroyed the cell wall ii Since no catalyst was usually added the purification step was not required after the process iii Water and FFA can be present in large quantities in wet algae biomass which can improve the efficiency of supercritical conversion process Jazzar et al. 2015 . The supercrit ical fluid SCM process is an advanced efficient environmentally friendly and low-energy biodiesel conversion technology but the diffi culty of heat recovery for commercial use is still the disadvantage of the technology Qadeer et al. 2021 . Rathnam and Madras 2019 studied using Shizochitrium limacinum microalgae as raw material to prepare biodiesel by supercritical methanol. The reaction was carried out at 270 C and 20 MPa and the biodiesel yield reached more than 90.0 in only 40 min. Rathnam et al. 2020 also studied the synthesis of fatty acid ethyl ester FAEEs in supercritical ethanol and supercritical ethyl acetate using dried microalgae as raw materials. Fig. 4 shows the effects of time and temperature on the conversion of Schizochitrium limacinum microalgae FAEEs from ethanol and ethyl acetate. The pressure was maintained at 20 MPa. The transesterification of ethanol reached 95.0 at 593 K and the biodiesel yield of ethyl acetate also reached more than 60.0 at 653 K. At the same time the pseudo-first-order kinetics and Arrhenius equation were used to evaluate the rate constant and activa tion energy of the two systems. The activation energies of ethanol and ethyl acetate systems were 67.1 and 78.5 kJ mol respectively. Compared with the ethyl acetate system the reaction rate of ethanol is higher. However the use of supercritical methanol or ethanol trans esterification is not economically feasible and consumes a lot of energy. Some cosolvents or solid catalysts can be appropriately added to improve this shortcoming. Nowadays there are also many fluids used to improve the efficiency of the biodiesel process. For example CO2 as a process fluid has a high diffusion rate and high solubility. Supercritical CO2 SC CO2 extraction of microalgae lipids has the advantages of low viscosity low tension high emission and easy separation. Khorram dashti et al. 2021 studied the effect of SC-CO2 on Chlorella vulgaris on biodiesel production. The fatty acid content extracted by the SC-CO2 method was the best at 370 bar and 40 C. Taher et al. 2015 used the SC-CO2 method to extract lipids from Nannochlorpsis sp. and converted them into biodiesel. The results showed that the yield of biodiesel was 35.0 higher than that in the traditional method. 4.5.2. Preparation of microalgae biodiesel by ionic liquid method In recent years the production of biodiesel from microalgae cata lyzed by ILs has become a new environmentally friendly production route. ILs were used as solvents and catalysts for the sustainable pro duction of biodiesel by microalgae respectively. ILs are organic salts H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 16 that are liquid at room temperature. Salts are amphoteric and mainly composed of an organic cation and an inorganic or organic anion. The second chapter also mentions the content of anions and cations. Due to their chemical properties when ionic liquids contact cells they destroy the cell wall and membrane resulting in lipid release. The non-volatility and thermal stability of ILs makes them a viable alternative to volatile organic solvents. Owing to the low vapor pressure fast reaction time and strong recovery and reuse ability of ionic liquids their activity may not be reduced even after repeated use Lozano et al. 2020 . Mal ekghasemi et al. 2021 synthesized four types of tetrabutylphospho nium carboxylate ionic liquids for the preparation of biodiesel by in-situ transesterification of Chlorella vulgaris. The main candidate ionic liquid catalyst was tetrabutylphosphonium formate. The yield was as high as 98.0 2.5 after optimization using the response surface. The reus ability of the ionic liquid was confirmed and the loss between recycling was less than 2 . Brønsted acidic ionic liquids can convert FFA and TAG into biodiesel without pretreatment which helps to reduce the pro duction cost of biodiesel Deshpande et al. 2022 . Khiratkar et al. 2018 prepared two Brønsted acidic ionic liquid catalysts containing benzimidazole and imidazolium cations and two alkaline ionic liquid catalysts. The results showed that the benzimidazole-based Brønsted acidic ionic liquid catalyst BBAIL catalyzed biodiesel yield was the highest reaching 96.0 and the catalyst could be recycled. In addition the addition of some more advanced ionic liquids such as supported ionic liquids and ionic liquid enzyme catalysts improves the catalytic active sites of microalgae biodiesel. Cheng et al. 2022 synthesized a novel efficient bifunctional catalyst by modifying the metal-organic framework IRMOF-3 with Brønsted acidic ionic liquid 1-butylsulfo nate-3-methylimidazolium bisulfate BSO3HMIm HSO4 IL . Through the acid-base reaction between the sulfonic acid group of ILs and the amino group of IRMOF-3 to form a chemical bond ILs are fixed on the IRMOF-3 skeleton. The bifunctional catalyst exhibited acid-base syner gistic catalysis and the synergistic effect of Brønsted acid and Lewis acid which could effectively catalyze the esterification and trans esterification of microalgae lipids. Under the optimal reaction condi tions the biodiesel yield was 98.2 . Since the strong ionic bond the catalyst has good reusability and the catalytic efficiency can still reach 85.5 after 6 cycles. Loading ILs can increase the surface area between the reactant and the catalyst and hydrophobic ILs are also excellent cocatalysts that bind to the enzyme which reduces the possibility of enzyme inactivation. Binary ILs mixtures have been used to develop one-step systems. The mixtures are hydrophobic with anions and cat ions and a long alkyl side chain providing a special reaction medium for biodiesel synthesis. It also can dissolve cellulose biomass with hy drophilicity. The dried Chlorella vulgaris was incubated in an appropriate binary mixture of ILs at 110 C. After cooling at 60 C it was converted into biodiesel by immobilized lipase for lipid extraction. Biodiesel production can be as high as 100.0 within 2 h at 60 C Ong et al. 2021 . Nonetheless ILs like any other catalysts are not intrinsically green and environmentally friendly. In particular the most utilized SFILs which bear an acidic -SO3H functionalized group in the cation of ILs are of extremely strong acidity and thus corrosive which could cause serious equipment corrosion. In addition high cost and ILs recovery are also major obstacles to its industrial application. The research and design of efficient and low-cost IL combined with microwave and ultrasonic-assisted technology is an option to achieve a more environ mentally friendly and sustainable biodiesel production route. 4.6. Microalgae catalytic conversion of biodiesel method summary Microalgae biodiesel production technology has been widely studied and applied for 50 years. Lipid TAG reacts with methanol or other alcohols to form FAAEs and glycerol under the action of a catalyst which is called a transesterification reaction. In the traditional two-step transesterification process lipid extraction and transesterification are divided into two steps to produce biodiesel. Due to the complexity of the traditional transesterification process the in-situ transesterification of the one-step process has become more popular in recent years. 4.6.1. Two-step transesterification method The traditional two-step transesterification method for biodiesel production has been applied for decades and the research is relatively mature including two steps namely lipid extraction and trans esterification Leung et al. 2010 . First the dehydrated and dried pre treated microalgae is broken by mechanical force or chemical solvent to extract lipids from biomass. Then lipid TAG and methanol undergo a transesterification reaction under a catalyst to form FAAE. However the traditional two-step transesterification process is not economically feasible. The dehydration drying and lipid extraction process consumes a lot of energy and cost accounting for 3 15 of the total production cost of microalgae biodiesel Fasaei et al. 2018 . The process also re quires the use of a large amount of solvent and requires the use of powerful machinery equipped with heating and stirring capabilities wasting a lot of energy and raw materials. In addition some downstream technologies such as centrifugation and extraction have the disadvan tages of high energy consumption and low processing capacity which limits the commercialization of these methods. Therefore in-situ transesterification was introduced as a one-step process to eliminate the two-stage lipid extraction and transesterification reaction process. 4.6.2. In-situ transesterification method In-situ transesterification ISTE is a one-step process that uses oily raw materials to extract lipid and catalyze the conversion to FAAEs Ideris et al. 2022 Kim et al. 2019 . In the in situ transesterification Fig. 4. Effect of time and temperature on the conversion of FAEEs from Schizochitrium limacinum microalgae using a ethanol and b ethyl acetate Rathnam et al. 2020 . H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 17 process methanol has dual functions as a chemical solvent and reactant for lipid extraction thereby reducing the input of chemical solvents. This technology eliminates expensive and tedious cell destruction and drying steps minimizes lipid extraction and solvent recovery steps greatly reduces the energy consumption of the process and reduces initial investment and indirect costs Goh et al. 2019 . Lem oes et al. 2016 investigated the production of FAEE from Chlorella sp. by in-situ transesterification and then compared it with the conversion of FAEE by extraction and transesterification extraction-esterification . The results showed that in situ transesterification increased the yield of FAEE compared with the extraction-esterification process and confirmed that in situ transesterification was an effective environmentally friendly and green approach. In-situ transesterification is considered to be a major improvement in the commercial production of biodiesel from microalgae. 4.7. Preparation of microalgae biofuels by thermochemical conversion method Thermochemical conversion process is one of the most preferred technologies for biomass value-added which has the advantages of high conversion efficiency and low capital cost. Microalgae biomass ther mochemical conversion technology mainly includes gasification lique faction and pyrolysis. Gasification is a thermochemical reaction that uses oxygen or oxygen-containing substances in the air as gasification agents to convert the combustible part of biomass fuel into combustible gas under high-temperature conditions mainly hydrogen carbon monoxide and methane which can recycle a large amount of crop waste and reduce environmental pollution. Liquefaction and pyrolysis can convert algal biomass into low molecular weight bio-oil and high energy density bio-crude oil respectively. Hydrothermal liquefaction HTL is a process of converting wet algae biomass into liquid biofuels at a tem perature of 200 450 C a pressure of 4 35 Mpa and in the presence of water. Compared with the traditional pyrolysis process it does not require expensive and tedious pre-drying of biomass has lower tem perature requirements requires less energy consumption and can pro cess different biomass at the same time. However the main limitations of HTL are the possibility of corrosion coke and tar formation blockage and reactor interruption. Co-liquefaction is also a thermochemical pro cess including the production of high-yield and high-quality bio-oil from a variety of biomass. The difference between liquefaction and co- liquefaction is that single raw material liquefaction and multi-raw ma terial co-liquefaction. It can customize the composition of bio-oil for downstream applications and can make full use of the various biomass obtained to control the composition and properties of bio-crude oil. Pyrolysis is the thermal degradation of biomass by heating under anaerobic conditions and the production of bio-oil by heating at me dium and high temperatures 350 700 C or in the presence of cata lysts. Bio-oil not only has a high bio-oil yield but also contains high hydrocarbons and octane numbers. The main limitation of pyrolysis is the existence of high oxygen and high water content in the pyrolysis liquid. The pyrolysis liquid can tolerate the addition of some water but before the phase separation occurs the amount of water added to the liquid is required. In other words adding a small amount of water can reduce the viscosity which is useful but adding too much water will reduce the calorific value which means that more liquid is needed to achieve the required amount Bridgwater 2012 . During the pyrolysis process the pipeline engine and turbine are blocked by the formation of tar with a boiling point above 360 C and low H C molar ratio. It is necessary to reduce the formation of tar and promote the normal reac tion through higher reaction temperature and the presence of a catalyst. The bio-oil obtained from the above process has unsatisfactory charac teristics such as water content high sulfur nitrogen and oxygen con tent high viscosity and long-chain hydrocarbons which limits its application as a biofuel. It needs to be further upgraded to become a viable biofuel. It can be upgraded by hydrogenation supercritical fluid SCFs and catalytic cracking to improve the stability of bio-oil reduce its aging potential reduce its oxygen content reduce its viscosity and improve the quality of bio-oil Arun et al. 2021 2022 . 5. Application prospect of microalgae biodiesel The research on microalgae biodiesel production mainly focuses on one or several steps of the whole microalgae to biodiesel process microalgae screening culture harvesting drying lipid extraction and catalytic conversion to biodiesel. The production of biodiesel from microalgae is roughly divided into four steps i Microalgae production algal strain screening and microalgae culture ii Harvest solid-liquid separation iii Extraction of high additional compounds such as lipids destruction of the cell wall and lipid extraction iv Lipid trans esterification to produce biodiesel catalyst and catalytic conversion method selection . Microalgae with high biomass and high oil yield were screened. A low-cost green and efficient method was proposed to stimulate microalgae to accumulate more lipids and environmentally friendly and efficient catalysts and catalytic methods were used to produce high-yield and high-quality microalgae biodiesel. Microalgae have been proven to be a promising and attractive raw material for biofuel production as their short growth cycle high biomass yield and lipid content good carbon sequestration capacity high value-added products and environmental sustainability which can be applied in different fields such as food feed nutritional drugs pharmaceuticals and biofuels Caporgno and Mathys 2018 . Microalgae biodiesel can be used as a green alternative fuel for petrochemical diesel. When mixed with diesel A20 D80 the thermal efficiency was the highest and hy drocarbon HC carbon monoxide CO particulate matter PM and smoke emissions were less Arun et al. 2021 . Nevertheless microalgae biodiesel faces many challenges in its production and commercialization Nazloo et al. 2022 . Although many advances have been made in laboratory-scale research a series of challenges such as production economic feasibility technological improvement and method innova tion and environmental pollution control need to be considered in the commercialization process i The cost of microalgae cultivation is high and a lot of time and resources e.g. water are needed for cultivation. In the process of microalgae harvesting a large amount of energy is consumed which is energy intensive ii Genetic engineering is a suit able method to enhance microalgae biomass accumulation. However more safety guidelines are needed for transgenic microalgae and their environmental sustainability and stability iii Due to the obstinate nature of microalgae cell walls and composition lipid extraction has always been one of the main factors restricting the production of microalgae biodiesel. Additional steps and chemical reagents are required to destroy cells to release lipids used for biodiesel production in vivo iv The addition of catalyst accelerates the catalytic conversion of biodiesel by microalgae but the expensive catalyst and the economic and environmental problems caused by some toxic catalysts need to be further studied v Microalgae biodiesel production rate is low and vulnerable to pollution by other substances thereby reducing the yield and quality of biodiesel the scale of microalgae cultivation is small and it is difficult to meet the global fuel market demand. The production transportation and use of microalgae biodiesel require a lot of invest ment to be properly implemented. The increase in capital and operating costs is the biggest bottleneck for commercialization. Environmental and cost considerations are also important topics for further research. At present it is still in small-scale production in the laboratory. The key technologies for large-scale production of biodiesel include the devel opment of efficient and economical microalgae culture systems the optimization of process parameters to further strengthen the bioengi neering photobioreactor culture system and the determination of high growth rate and oil production. Optimal culture conditions as well as advanced technologies for microalgae biomass separation and harvest ing. The cultivation of microalgae should focus on screening a variety of microalgae that are resistant to pests and diseases and can accumulate H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 18 lipids in large quantities through genetic engineering technology to develop active substances in food pharmaceutical and animal feed at the industrial level and increase the yield of high-value products Bhushan et al. 2020 Kadir et al. 2018 Gaurav et al. 2023 . The po tential economic value and environmental safety issues in the main production processes of microalgae biodiesel including microalgae culture microalgae harvesting lipid extraction and biodiesel catalytic conversion deserve further discussion and research to find the most suitable production model to achieve high efficiency economic feasi bility and environmental sustainability. 5.1. Economic value The economic analysis of microalgae biodiesel production is based on the estimation of capital investment operating costs and benefits. In addition to the sale of biodiesel the economic value of residual biomass and glycerol by-products is considered. Branco-Vieira et al. 2020 analyzed the production of biodiesel by microalgae. Under the facility scale of 15.247 ha the final production cost of biodiesel was estimated to be 0.33 euros L and the final production cost of biomass was 2.01 euros kg. It can produce about 1811 tons of dry microalgae biomass and 171 705 L of biodiesel. Considering the remaining biomass and glycerol by-products the production of microalgae biodiesel is an investment recovery period of 5 10 years. In addition to improve the maximum profit it is necessary to consider the local actual situation consider the location of the production plant and give priority to the use of local resources low-energy technologies and renewable energy in the plant facilities to reduce the final cost of biodiesel production. Ianda et al. 2022 studied the development of sub-Saharan countries Guinea- Bissau and found that local energy was scarce. Considering the demand production and economic conditions of Guinea-Bissau the production cost and economic feasibility of biodiesel were simulated. The com mercial simulation software Aspen Plus V12.0 was used to conduct a technical and economic assessment of biodiesel production in Guinea-Bissau. The simulation showed that 2 103 m3 of biodiesel was produced each year and the total manufacturing cost algae culture and industrial processing was estimated to be about USD 0.9 kg. This cost is very competitive compared to diesel at local gas stations in Guinea-Bissau and the entire biodiesel supply chain is optimistic. Guinea-Bissau does not have an oil refinery and the demand for bio diesel is small compared to sub-Saharan African countries such as South Africa Mozambique Nigeria and Senegal. Therefore the production of biodiesel from nano-green algae growing in the runway pool is a very promising measure to ensure the technical and economic feasibility of biodiesel production in the country. It should be recommended to establish a production base near Bissau the capital of Guinea-Bissau the country s economic center to facilitate the logistics of resources that provide feed for the cultivation of microalgae runway systems and to reduce the logistics costs of biodiesel distribution and sales. As part of the biorefinery process microalgae are planted harvested extracted lipids and converted into biodiesel. A technical and economic analysis of this process was carried out to estimate the cost of microalgae biodiesel production. The price of producing a ton of algae can range from 150 to 6000 depending on the different culture methods used. Under the scale of annual oil production of 500 tons of C. vulgaris the production cost of lipid per kilogram of heterotrophic culture of C. vulgaris is 7.5 and the production cost of lipid per kilogram of phototrophic culture is 480. The operating cost of a phototrophic culture is 65 times that of a heterotrophic culture. This result is attributed to the slow growth rate of Chlorella in the light culture mode so additional water supply and en ergy input of the light source are required. Although the heterotrophic culture of C. vulgaris has better economic feasibility than phototrophic culture the production cost of extracting lipids from microalgae is not competitive with the production cost of edible crops and petroleum diesel. The most commonly used methods for microalgae cultivation are open culture systems open pool and channel systems and closed systems such as photobioreactors . The open pond system facilitates large-scale farming and economic feasibility while the closed aquacul ture system is more convenient in terms of quality control and mainte nance of aquaculture conditions. Compared with the open system the closed system needs more funds to run. In open ponds and photo bioreactors triglycerides were sold at 8.52 gallon and 18.10 gallon respectively with a return of 10 . For large-scale production the cost of open pond aquaculture is low but the biomass productivity is low the water demand is large and the operating cost is increased. Due to the huge amount of drainage the centrifugal process consumes a lot of en ergy and cost. The flocculation process is considered to be more effective because it uses less energy and has a lower initial investment. The cost of producing a gallon of biodiesel ranges from 5 to 22 per gallon. Compared with photobioreactors it is economically feasible to synthe size carotene from Dunaliella salina cultured in open ponds. However because astaxanthin has a high market price in the photobioreactor culture of Haematococcus pluvialis the extraction of astaxanthin from pigment 18 makes the process profitable. Residue biomass can also be used as animal feed through simple processing and the price of animal feed varies from 1384 to 5066 per ton Kim et al. 2022 Mariadhas et al. 2023 . Although the above shows that microalgae biodiesel has great commercial potential commercial production and research are still in its infancy. The cost of microalgae biodiesel is several times higher than that of traditional lipid production Kumar et al. 2022 . The price of microalgae biodiesel cultured from the light-fed mode in open ponds and closed photobioreactors maybe 2.5 times and 4.1 times higher than that of gasoline diesel respectively Lam et al. 2019 . Some obstacles and challenges need to be overcome to expand the production and commercialization strategy of microalgae biodiesel. The economic value of microalgae biodiesel production is summarized below which provides a basis for the economic feasibility of microalgae biodiesel production. i In the process of microalgae cultivation can fix CO2 in the at mosphere and reduce the economic investment required for the treatment of greenhouse gas CO2. ii In the process of microalgae harvesting flocculation sedimenta tion technology can reduce the operating cost of the harvesting process and the cost requirement of dynamic cross-flow filtration for pre-concentrated microalgae biomass is lower than that of centrifugal technology Yang et al. 2023b . iii In the process of microalgae lipid extraction it is essential to use lipid extraction methods with low energy consumption low cost and high efficiency. Zou et al. 2021 studied the lipid extraction of microalgae by buoyancy ball method and ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction BBUASE . Firstly the microalgae biomass was harvested by the buoyant-bead flotation method and then the surface-layered polymeric microspheres were pretreated by ultrasound and the lipid was extracted by hexane isopropanol solvent. In addition liquid carbon dioxide lCO2 has been shown to successfully extract lipids from microalgae slurry in contrast to saving energy by operating at lower pressures and tempera tures Lee et al. 2023 . iv In the process of catalytic conversion of biodiesel by microalgae the in-situ transesterification process is used to produce biodiesel in one step which can effectively improve the yield reduce the cost and simplify the required process equipment. v In the production of microalgae biodiesel saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids are the main components of microalgae biodiesel. Fatty acids help prevent cardiovascular diseases cancer and inflammatory diseases in humans Caporgno and Mathys 2018 . Natural by-products such as carotenoids crude proteins carbohydrates and astaxanthin have a positive impact on human health. For example they are used as nutri tional supplements dietary additives and pharmaceutical com ponents. Microalgae-derived compounds such as peptides have H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 19 antioxidant antihypertensive immunomodulatory anticancer hepatoprotective and anticoagulant activities. Astaxanthin as an important antioxidant and nutritional health compound is widely used in dietary supplements and cosmetic raw materials. It has the functions of anti-aging anti-tumor and prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases Li et al. 2021a Chhandama and Rai 2023 . The production of biodiesel products and derived compounds from microalgae has great potential and economic value. 5.2. Environmental safety To meet the huge demand for fossil energy potential environmental safety must be assessed based on its environmental consequences and the energy needs of biodiesel production. The whole-process life cycle approach LCA from cradle to grave was used to analyze the environ mental impact and energy demand from microalgae to the obtained biodiesel and sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the impact of each process on the LCA system under given conditions quantifying the list of interventions related to environmental issues throughout the life cycle Kumar and Pal 2023 Karthikeyan et al. 2020 . In the long run microalgae will be a more desirable raw material. It shows higher competitive performance in terms of CO2 emissions and energy and can be used to treat wastewater. It not only reduces soil groundwater pollution but also helps to improve biodiesel production. Pollutant assimilation and CO2 biosequestration in wastewater protect the envi ronment and ultimately contribute to the circular economy and envi ronmental sustainability. Compared with petrochemical diesel and the first two generations of biodiesel microalgae production of biodiesel can improve environmental benefits Kumar et al. 2022 Ahmad et al. 2023 . If the production of microalgae biodiesel can be expanded on a large scale the environmental pollution caused by lipid and coal com bustion will be greatly reduced and bring a lot of economic benefits. However although many advances have been made in laboratory-scale research energy consumption and environmental pollution in industrial production are still challenges in the future. i In the process of microalgae culture it can also grow in harsh environments high salt heavy metals etc. . It can be cultured in industrial wastewater or metallurgical slag leaching solution to reduce toxic heavy metals to improve water quality and a large amount of CO2 may bring ecological risks to the environment Wang et al. 2019 Yu et al. 2023 Marouˇsek et al. 2023 Yin et al. 2020 . ii During the microalgae harvesting process emerging compounds biocoagulants bioflocculants that can be used during the har vesting of suspended microalgae were proposed which can maintain the cell structure and do not introduce toxicity into the harvested microalgae biomass Kurniawan et al. 2022 . iii In the process of microalgae lipid extraction the use of chemical reagents may hurt agriculture and drainage safety. Solvents pollute the environment such as chloroform and hexane which are highly toxic solvents and have a great impact on the envi ronment and human health. Therefore solvents with less harm to human and environmental safety are used instead of them. 2- methyltetrahydrofuran 2-MeTHF and cyclopentyl methyl ether CPME solvents are some of the most promising solvents to replace chloroform and hexane de Jesus et al. 2020a Jesus and Filho 2020b . iv In the process of microalgae-catalyzed biodiesel the supercritical method does not require the use of a catalyst which is an envi ronmentally friendly method for the conversion of microalgae biodiesel. 6. Conclusion In the era of industrialization the depletion of fossil fuels and the excessive emission of greenhouse gas CO2 prompt people to turn their attention to microalgae biodiesel. Microalgae are ubiquitous and diverse photosynthetic organisms in nature. They contain high-value com pounds such as lipids and polysaccharides and have outstanding ap plications in carbon dioxide emission reduction and biodiesel energy production. However how to ensure the efficient production of micro algae biodiesel under economic and environmental problems is currently a difficult problem. In this paper the methods of improving the oil production of microalgae growth and the yield of microalgae biodiesel are analyzed and summarized and the following conclusions are drawn. i Various environmental stresses such as light temperature pH heavy metals and nutrients promote the growth and oil produc tion of microalgae. Under optimal conditions the biomass of microalgae can be increased by more than two times and the lipid content can be increased by up to three times. In contrast heavy metal stress can not only increase the biomass accumula tion of microalgae but also help to remove heavy metals and play an environmental remediation role. ii HCO3 PO4 3 Cu2+ Fe3+ Zn2+ Mg2+ and other anions and cat ions promote the growth of microalgae by participating in the photosynthesis and physiological metabolism of microalgae and control lipid synthesis by overexpressing key rate-limiting en zymes in lipid metabolism and other genetic engineering. The two-stage culture mode can simultaneously improve the growth and oil production of microalgae. iii The addition of various catalysts improves the catalytic conver sion rate and yield of biodiesel. The optimized conditional yield can basically reach 90 . Among them heterogeneous nano- catalysts are superior to other traditional homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts due to their large specific surface area high catalytic activity high stability improved active sites high biodiesel conversion rate and reusability. The supercritical method and the ionic liquid method are environmentally friendly and feasible because they do not use catalysts. iv From the perspective of economic benefits and environmental safety the use of microalgae biodiesel to replace traditional fossil fuels can not only protect the ecological environment and reduce the damage to the environment but also microalgae biodiesel is a renewable carbon-neutral energy. However in the current com mercial production process of microalgae biodiesel it is difficult to compete with fossil fuels in terms of economic issues such as investment operating costs and benefits. It is also necessary to consider the environmental risks caused by the use of too many biochemical catalysts and genetic metabolic engineering. v The future research direction of microalgae biodiesel is to breed microalgae with rapid growth and high lipid content optimize culture conditions and processes make full use of the mode of biorefinery in photobioreactor engineering and adopt large-scale production to reduce production costs in combination with local conditions. The biomass content of microalgae is greatly improved by using heterotrophic culture mode or combined with solid waste utilization such as industrial wastewater culture. The development of more environmentally friendly cheap and efficient catalysts and catalytic methods such as the study of functionalized magnetic nano-catalysts. Because the lipid accu mulation process and regulation mechanism in microalgae are very complex it is necessary to further study the regulation mechanism of lipid metabolism pathways and carry out genetic engineering modification based on the combination of lipid synthesis and metabolic pathways and regulation mechanisms. In short the main research direction of microalgae biodiesel is to H. Liu et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 436 2024 140538 20 improve the production efficiency of microalgae biodiesel reduce production costs clean production and truly realize the industrial application of alternative petrochemical energy.

Research on microalgae oils often are focused on microalgae oil extraction and biomass harvesting techniques. However energy in- tensive and costly lipid extraction methods are the major obstacles hampering microalgae biodiesel commer- cialisation. Direct biodiesel synthesis avoids such problems as it combines lipid extraction techniques and transesteriﬁcation into a single step. In this review the potential of direct biodiesel synthesis from microalgae biomass was comprehensively analysed. The various species of microalgae commonly used as biodiesel feedstock was critically assessed particularly on high lipid content species. The production of microalgae biodiesel via direct conversion from biomass was systematically discussed covering major enhancements such as hetero- geneous catalysts the use of ultrasonic and microwave- techniques and supercritical alcohols that focus on the overall improvement of biodiesel production. In addition this review illustrates the cultivation conditions for biomass growth and lipid productivity improvement the available harvesting and lipid extraction technologies as well as the key challenges and future prospect of microalgae biodiesel production. This review serves as a basis for future research on direct biodiesel synthesis from modiﬁed microalgae biomass to improve proﬁtability of microalgae biodiesel. 1. Introduction Biofuel has commanded a growing interest globally due to the limited fossil deposits and the volatile fuel prices. Energy support ci- vilization for development and mobility. But the continuous usage of fossil fuel especially for transportation has long being identiﬁed major contributor of air pollutants. The emissions of unburned hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides 1 are found to take years oﬀ people s lives. This has prompted the needs to ﬁnd an alternative re- newable fuel source for transportation and biofuel being one of the alternatives. Biofuel can be deﬁned as fuel that is produced directly or indirectly from biomass sources 2 . Major issues like energy security rural development and climate change 3 have catalysed the rapid development of biofuel. One of the most extensively studied fuel types is biodiesel a sub- stitute for fossil diesel. The advantages biodiesel possess over fossil like renewability toxic free sulphur free and oﬀer better lubricity have been well documented 4 . In the last two decades diﬀerent genera- tions of biodiesels are being developed 5 6 and each generation of biodiesel diﬀers by the feedstock used. Table 1 summarises the diﬀer- ences between each generation of biodiesels. In 2015 69 of the global biodiesel output was produced from edible vegetable oils such as soybean oil rapeseed oil and palm oil 12 . Such high percentage of edible sources usage causes a dilemma due to its implications on food security and commodity prices. Despite the fact that oil crops cultivation helps boosted rural areas economies but the large areas needed for fuel s crops cultivation is not sustainable in the long run. All of these have led researchers to microalgae deemed as the third generation biodiesel. This feedstock has less competition with oil crops for land availability 2 . Microalgae contain neutral lipids that can be used for biodiesel production as well as it also contains other high Received 16 May 2018 Received in revised form 29 January 2019 Accepted 13 February 2019 Corresponding author.

T value compounds such as carotenoids used in the food and feed in- dustries and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids like DHA and EPA that are beneﬁcial for human health 13 . Microalgae only produce small amounts of lipid under optimum growth conditions but when the organism is subjected to environ- mental stress it accumulates lipids as the carbon and energy storage 14 . The lipid accumulation of the current microalgae mass culture system is lower lipid than its theoretical maximum 15 . Hence many studies have been conducted to enhance the microalgae biomass lipid productivity and production eﬃciency concurrently keeping the pro- duction cost at a minimum 16 . The advantages of microalgae as biodiesel feedstock parameters aﬀecting the lipid extraction-transesteriﬁcation process and the eco- nomic potential of microalgae biodiesel have been extensively reviewed 17 19 . Yet not many reviews were found on direct biodiesel synth- esis from microalgae biomass. Direct biodiesel synthesis or in-situ transesteriﬁcation has omitted the oil extraction process where lipid is directly transesteriﬁed from biomass. This biodiesel synthesis process has been tested on feedstocks such as Jatropha oilseeds rapeseed and rice bran 20 22 . In the conventional method oil is ﬁrst extracted out before the transesteriﬁcation reaction hence various solvents are needed for these processes. However in in-situ transesteriﬁcation only a single solvent is used for the entire reaction 23 . This process in- tensiﬁcation step eliminates the need for excessive solvent and oil re- ﬁning processes 22 . Additionally direct biodiesel synthesis helps prevents lipid loss during processing that maximises the conversion rate thus improves the proﬁtability 23 . This paper aims to provide a critical review on the potential of in- stantaneous biodiesel synthesis from microalgae biomass. The potential harvesting and extraction methods to increase biomass and lipid yields are deliberated. Discussions on the diﬀerent technologies applied to produce biodiesel from microalgae biomass are included. Besides the parameters aﬀecting direct biodiesel synthesis from biomass are de- liberated from the fatty acid methyl ester FAME yield. Furthermore the methods to enhance lipid accumulation and biomass productivity are evaluated. Finally the challenges and future economic outlook of microalgae biodiesel will be duly covered as well. 2. Microalgae cultivation conditions Microalgae can grow anywhere with suﬃcient sunlight and CO2 24 . In order for microalgae to be a sustainable and feasible biodiesel feedstock the cultivation and production costs must be kept low. High value compounds like carotenoid phytosterol polyunsaturated fatty acid etc. nutraceuticals can be co-produced from microalgae to di- versify revenue. Various microalgae species have been identiﬁed as potential bio- diesel feedstock owing to their high lipid accumulation abilities 2 40 of their weight 24 . Table 2 shows the potential microalgae species for biodiesel production and their lipid content under normal cultivation conditions. There are numerous studies on the optimum cultivation methods for high-lipid-content microalgae for biodiesel production and some common microalgae genus like Nannochloropsis Chlorella and Spirulina have been identiﬁed as potential feedstock 32 34 . Past works also concluded that lipid accumulation in microalgae are species dependent and can be aﬀected by the culture conditions 35 . Despite of that the high amounts of lipid often come at the cost of lower biomass pro- ductivity 36 and the relative amount of each lipid class can also vary under diﬀerent culture conditions 37 . Therefore lipid productivity is an important factor in determining the feasibility of using microalgae as biodiesel feedstock. Environmental stress such as pH nitrogen salinity and light are common methods use to induce lipids carbohydrates and other valu- able compounds 38 . Nitrogen and phosphorus are crucial nutrients for microalgae growth and lipid production. Nutrient starvation is found to increase lipid content in microalgae but at the same time compromises cell growth. In order to circumvent the growth restriction the cultivation of microalgae can be divided into two stages. Suﬃcient nitrogen is provided for biomass production in the ﬁrst stage. In the second stage nitrogen starvation is introduced to induce lipid accu- mulation 38 . In a nutrient-deplete environment the need for mem- brane lipids will cease and more fatty acids are converted into neutral lipids 39 . Cellular growth will be disrupted and all available carbon will be converted into lipids instead of protein 40 . 2.1. Nitrogen starvation condition Nitrogen starvation causes the microalgae cells to synthesize lipid in the form of triglyceride fatty acids TG-FA that are used as carbon and energy storage 41 . For biodiesel production TG-FA is converted to methyl or ethyl esters via the transesteriﬁcation process 42 . There- fore one of the main criteria for biodiesel-feedstock species selection is the ability to accumulate high amount of lipid. Table 3 shows several microalgae species and their lipid content under nitrogen-starved con- ditions. Nutrient limitations will aﬀect the photosynthetic capacity of mi- croalgae but how severe such limitation has on cell division and TG lipid synthesis is species-speciﬁc. Some species are better adaptor than other species under nutrient limiting conditions. For example Nannochloropsis gaditana are able to retain its chloroplast structure and photosynthetic capacity for a longer period of nitrogen starvation than Neochloris oleoabundans. The latter species is found to dissipate energy Table 1 Diﬀerences between generations of biodiesel.

Goh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 107 2019 59 74 60 under nitrogen-limited conditions and disintegrate its plastid to reduce its energy intake 56 . Species with high biomass productivity under unfavourable conditions is beneﬁcial for lipid production 57 . Roopnarain et.al 58 found that nitrogen concentration is directly proportional to biomass productivity. Due to this the overall lipid productivity in nitrogen-starved conditions may actually be lower than normal growth conditions 59 because the overall biomass has failed to reach a desirable amount as cell divisions were disrupted by the lack of nitrogen. Limited cells are available for lipid accumulation thus reducing the overall lipid productivity. Mendoza et. al 60 has reported that certain species of algae that lacked cell wall had a higher extractable lipid than those with cell wall. In addition some species demonstrated sequential accumulation of starch and lipids when subjected to nitrogen-deplete condition for an extended duration during which all available carbon will be converted into lipid and starch from chlorophyll will too be converted into lipid. When this occurs the space previously occupied by plastid and chlor- ophyll will be used to store the lipid bodies 45 . This exchange of starch for lipid via nutrient manipulation is another option for eﬀective lipid accumulation enhancement. This is an almost similar approach as bio-engineered-strains where starch synthesis pathway is blocked to increase lipid production but has failed to achieve its objective largely due to decreased growth. 2.2. Phosphorus starvation condition Besides nitrogen phosphorus is one of the essential nutrients for biomass growth needed for the synthesis of key molecules such as nu- cleic acids adenosine triphosphate ATP and phospholipids 61 . ATP is the primary product of photosynthesis and is crucial for microalgae growth. Microalgae utilise phosphorus in two steps the ﬁrst through the construction of organic cellular components such as phospholipids and in the second step the remaining excess is used to produce in- organic polyphosphate granules 62 . Currently the agriculture in- dustry depends on phosphate rocks as phosphorus source however the deposits are expected to be exhausted by the end of this century 63 . Owing to that it is important to practise sustainable use of materials. Wastewater contains nitrogen and phosphorus that can be converted into biomass and other bio-products via microalgae. Delgadillo-Mirquez 64 found that mixed microalgae and bacteria are able to completely remove phosphate ions at 25 °C in a high rate algal pond. Hence the use of wastewater for microalgae cultivation can signiﬁcantly reduce biodiesel production cost. However it should be noted that some wastewater may contain possible inhibitors that could impede microalgae growth 65 . Phosphorus starvation has lesser eﬀects on microalgae photo- synthesis in comparison to nitrogen starvation 66 . In a study of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under phosphorus-limiting condition it is found that the number of ribosomes was reduced to maintain protein synthesis and polyphosphate storage 38 . In another example using Monodus subterraneus phosphorus starvation is found to induce a six fold increase in lipid production 67 . Meanwhile Chu 59 has de- monstrated that the biomass production of Chlorella vulgaris under suﬃcient phosphorus supply in a nitrogen-starved condition was si- milar to that of nitrogen-suﬃcient condition where the maximum lipid content attained was 58.39 mg L day. Therefore it can be deduced from these studies that the impact from phosphorus starvation is less than that of nitrogen starvation. 2.3. Calcium starvation and magnesium supplement condition Other important nutrients for microalgae growth but rarely studied are calcium and magnesium 68 . Magnesium is used for plant protein synthesis and is also part of the enzymes involved in photosynthetic carbon ﬁxation and metabolism 69 . Meanwhile calcium is used in cell wall and membrane structure and serves as an intracellular mes- senger that coordinates responses to environmental changes 68 . There are limited studies on microalgae responses during magnesium and calcium starvation in terms of biomass growth and lipid accumulation. Esakkimuthu 68 found that a supplement of magnesium induced 54.6 lipid accumulation in Scenedesmus obliquus without aﬀecting its biomass growth. On the other hand lipid accumulations due to calcium and phosphorus starvation caused 52.9 and 47.6 lipid accumulation respectively. These results suggested that culturing media that contain high concentration of magnesium but low amount of calcium might provide a better alternative than conventional nutrient starvation Table 3 Lipid content of algae species under nitrogen-starved conditions.

Environmental stress condition Microalgae biomass growth and lipid accumulation are also aﬀected by environmental stresses such as light intensity pH and salinity. Although the starvation of certain nutrients can induced lipid accu- mulation in microalgae the biomass productivity is likely compro- mised. Light is an important factor for microalgae growth. It provides energy to induce the conversion of dissolved inorganic matter in the medium during photosynthesis 70 . Light wavelength and intensity are important for biomass growth but microalgae can only absorb certain wavelengths of the natural light spectrum 400 700 nm 28 . When microalgae is grown in wastewater light intensity is the limiting factor rather than nutrient availability 71 . Microalgae under light limiting condition increase the amount of chlorophyll linearly with light intensity. However under high light intensity microalgae will develop an acclimation mechanism known as photo inhibition to prevent excessive energy harvesting 72 which is attained by reducing the chlorophyll level. Despite the fact that high light intensity induces lipid synthesis but excessive exposure would lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species and acidiﬁcation that cause irreversible damage to the chlor- ophyll 73 . For microalgae grown in photo-bioreactors light dis- tribution in the culture is crucial due to shading where the light in- tensity received by every cell diﬀers 74 . Kurpan Nogueira 14 found that high light intensity of 300 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and low tem- perature of 20 °C induced a 70 increase in oil content in microalgae. On the other hand Wang et al. 75 found that red light diodes promote better biomass growth because the adsorption bands of chlorophyll were present in the red light wavelength. LEDs provide several ad- vantages over the use of ﬂuorescent lamps for microalgae growth be- cause of their narrow band spectrum low heat generation and high eﬃciency 76 . Fluorescent dyes are another innovation employed to alter high-energy protons to low-energy light wavelength for micro- algae growth. Seo 77 found that maximum biomass growth is ob- tained when using red light whereas maximum lipid content is achieved with blue paint. The selection of suitable microalgae strain should include the optimisation of culture and lighting conditions for maximum production eﬃciency. Carbon dioxide CO2 is reduced via photosynthesis where the captured carbon is converted into carbohydrates proteins nuclei acids and lipids 78 . On the other hand dissolved CO2 in the marine en- vironment reacts with the water to form carbonic acid H2CO3 which will dissociate into bicarbonates HCO 3 and bicarbonate will dis- sociate into carbonate ion CO 3 and hydrogen ions H+ lowering the ambient pH that inhibit microalgae growth 79 . In an alkaline en- vironment HCO3 is the dominant dissolved inorganic carbon that can be found in wastewater 80 . HCO3 is consumed by microalgae via cation exchange active transport and or through catalytic conversion in the forms of CO2 and OH 81 . pH is important for microalgae biomass and lipid accumulation because it aﬀects microalgae metabolism 82 . Common microalgae species such as Chroococcus turgidus Lyngbya confervoides Nostoc com- mune Chlorella sp. Chaetoceros calcitrans and Skeletonema costatum showed best growth rates at neutral pH while other species such as Chlorella sorokiniana pH 8 and N. oculata pH 8.5 prefer slightly alkali pH values 83 . Breuer 84 reported that the neutral pH and tem- perature of 27.5 °C were the optimum conditions for maximum lipid accumulation in Scenedesmus obliquus. However for Chlorella sor- okiniana DOE 1412 the optimum growth and lipid accumulation pH were at pH 6 due to the microalgae preference of acidic CO2 over al- kaline HCO3 82 . Liao et al. 73 observed that while low pH condi- tions leads to lower biomass growth rates the eﬀect is reversible and gentler than high intensity light conditions. This suggests that pH which is species speciﬁc should be optimised prior to light intensity in a culture to avoid photoinhibition that causes permanent damage to essential proteins 85 . Similar to other environmental stresses salinity also aﬀects the biomass growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae. High salinity creates high osmotic pressure of the external environment which generates pressure within the microalgae cell that aﬀects membrane ﬂuidity and permeability 28 . In high salinity environment the cel- lular osmoregulation mechanism is activated to equilibrate the in- tracellular osmotic pressure with that of the external. This mechanism will induce the accumulation of lipid due to changes in the fatty acid metabolism 86 . Sodium chloride NaCl is commonly used as salinity modiﬁer to induce lipid accumulation in microalgae while the studies on usage of other types of salt such as potassium chloride KCl mag- nesium chloride MgCl2 and calcium chloride CaCl2 are limited 87 . An increase of 2.52 fold in lipid content was obtained for Scenedesmus obliquus XJ002 when the cells were treated with 0.20 M of NaCl 88 but in another study 47 cell death was also reported when Chlamy- domonas reinhardtii CC124 was exposed to high concentration of NaCl after 3 days 89 though the lipid content has increased. While in comparison study of using diﬀerent type of salt Wang et al. 90 re- ported that no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found on the lipid accu- mulation of Chlorella protothecoides between NaCl and KCl. On the other hand Srivastava et al. 87 observed that CaCl2 intensiﬁed lipid accu- mulation in Chlorella CG12 and Desmodesmus GS12 the most compared with other types of salt. As most of the factors i.e. light intensity pH and salinity aﬀecting microalgae biomass and lipid productivity are species-speciﬁc specially tailored cultivation conditions are needed to ensure maximum pro- ductivity and at the same time keeping the production cost low. The two stage cultivation process where microalgae is ﬁrst grown to achieve maximum biomass growth before the stress-induced lipid accumulation step is preferred to prevent loss of biomass 91 . 3. Harvesting and extraction technologies After microalgae species selection the next important step is the harvesting technique. Eﬀective harvesting technique will minimize energy wastage and prevent loss of biomass yield. The next process is lipid extraction. The combination of eﬀective harvesting and lipid ex- traction methods will enhance production eﬃciency. There is also op- portunity for the coproduction of other high value products like nu- traceuticals pigments food and etc 92 .

Many diﬀerent techniques have been applied and the major ones include centrifuga- tion ﬂocculation ﬁltration and screening gravity sedimentation ﬂoatation and electricity assisted techniques 36 . The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed in the following sub- sections. Generally common disadvantages shared by these techniques are high capital cost high energy consumption and long extraction period 93 . 3.1.1. Centrifugation Centrifugation is a popular option for microalgae bulk harvesting. Centrifugal recovery is rapid and this technique avoids the use of che- mical solvents for separation which eliminates the risk of chemical contamination 92 . However the maintenance of freely moving parts and the high energy consumption needed to spin cells out of suspen- sion has made the process costly 5 . Cell damage may also occur due to the generated heat high sheer and gravitational forces applied 94 . Furthermore long operation time will be required for eﬃcient se- paration of biomass in large volume suspension 95 . 3.1.2. Flocculation Flocculation is considered among the most cost eﬀective methods for microalgae biomass recovery and it is able to accommodate large volumes of cultures 96 . Flocculation and coagulation can be carried out chemically biologically or magnetically. Metal salts such as alum and ferric chloride can be used as coagulants where the metal ions will hydrolyse in water and precipitate 96 . One major disadvantage of chemical ﬂocculation is that the metal will remain in the residue after lipid extraction thus aﬀecting the subsequent use of residue as animal feed 94 . Bio-ﬂocculation refers to ﬂocculation that is achieved though bio- logical means. Flocculation can occurs naturally and spontaneously during microalgae blooms in lakes and ponds and it is believed to be caused by the presence of extracellular polymer substances in the water. Flocculation can also be induced using bacteria fungi or other naturally ﬂocculating microalgae but the cultivation of bacteria fungi or in combination with other microalgae requires carbon source and wastewater is rich in carbon source. The bio-ﬂocculation technique has been implemented successfully in wastewater treatment plants how- ever the underlying mechanism is still not very clear 96 . Magnetic adsorbents like magnetite Fe2O3 nanoparticles can be added to microalgae suspension to induce magnetic ﬂocculation. Separation of microalgae from medium is achieved when a magnetic ﬁeld is applied 93 . This approach is simple and reusable where it has been adopt in other industries as well 97 . However the separation of the magnetic adsorbents from the residue for reuse purposes can be costly 93 . 3.1.3. Filtration and screening Dewatering is usually achieved by ﬁltration and screening and is normally carried out after ﬂocculation to improve harvesting eﬃciency. A ﬁltration membrane is used to collect microalgae deposits as the system forces the suspension ﬂuid to ﬂow through it 98 . However as the membrane thickens the ﬂow resistance also increases due to clogging and membrane replacement is needed to maintain eﬃciency that will add to the operational cost 99 . Cross ﬂow ﬁltration system which uses tangential ﬂow to remove thick ﬁlter cakes is introduced to circumvent this problem but this approach increases the operation time 100 . Low density culture can be harvested using this approach but it may not be feasible for large scale setup 98 . 3.1.4. Gravity sedimentation Microalgae settling rate is crucial for the gravitational sedimenta- tion method. Christenson Sims 99 concluded that the settling rates from 0.1 to 2.6 cmh-1 are too slow and will lead to the deterioration of biomass during settling. Agar gel is found to promote microalgae cluster growth that will increase the settling velocity 101 . Gravitational se- dimentation may be low in cost and require minimal use of energy but is too unreliable for industrial settings. The combination of gravita- tional sedimentation and ﬂocculation has been suggested to improve harvesting eﬃciency. 3.1.5. Flotation Flotation can be described as inverted sedimentation where air bubbles provide lifting force for particle separation 98 . Surface-active components are absorbed on the surface of air bubbles that allows re- covery of biological component at a higher concentration coeﬃcient in a single step 102 . The addition of surfactant will cause the micro- algae s surface to be more hydrophobic which will allow for easier biomass removal from the culture 103 . Bubble size surfactant con- centration and pH are important parameters aﬀecting the eﬃciency of this approach 98 . 3.1.6. Electricity assisted techniques Electricity has been applied to improve the eﬃciency of microalgae harvesting techniques. This approach can be deemed as en- vironmentally friendly as they do not require the use of chemicals. Since microalgae cells are negatively charged when the culture is subjected to an electric ﬁeld the microalgae particles will concentrate at the anode 98 this process is known as electrophoresis. Moreover electricity is also used to enhance ﬂocculation and ﬂoatation these techniques are known as electro-ﬂocculation and electro-ﬂotation. Electro-ﬂocculation utilises charge neutralisation which creates sorp- tion aﬃnity for negatively charged particles 104 . On the other hand electro-ﬂotation is achieved by formation of microbubbles at the cathode that will capture ﬂoating particles and allows for better mi- croalgae separation 105 . 3.2. Lipid Extraction Techniques There are currently no established methods for microalgae lipid extraction. However much research has been done to reduce solvent consumption to enhance extraction yield to reduce extraction time to improve end product properties among others 106 . A few factors have been identiﬁed as crucial for large scale lipid extraction they are extraction eﬃciency process duration reactivity with lipids capital and operational cost process safety and waste generated 107 . Cell wall disruption is an important step to improve lipid extraction eﬃ- ciency since passive diﬀusion across cell wall is slow. Cell wall and membrane disruptions will allow direct access of solvent to the in- tracellular lipid 108 which increases the lipid recovery eﬃciency. There are many diﬀerent types of cell disruption method available which can be generally categorized into mechanical and non-mechan- ical methods. Fig. 2 shows the various types of cell disruption methods. 3.2.1. Mechanical Methods Mechanical methods of lipid extraction include mechanical pressing ultrasonic assisted oil extraction microwave assisted oil ex- traction electric pulse modes and cell homogenization. Generally mechanical methods result in high biomass losses and low selectivity towards the lipids 109 . However certain mechanical processes reduce harmful solvent utilisation as well as decrease processing duration 110 . Unicellular microalgae strains often have thick cell wall that block the release of intracellular lipid which is unsuitable for me- chanical pressing 111 . Hence for industrial scale lipid extraction the conventional mechanical pressing is not a feasible method to utilise. Simple mechanical pressing use equipment such as screw press bead B.H.H. Goh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 107 2019 59 74 63 milling piston extruder or pulverisation in mortar to separate biomass cake from the oil component 112 . Abbassi 113 has reported that the utilisation of hydraulic pressing alone for N. oculata microalgae can only achieved 51.05 3.23 disruption fraction for lipids whereas the addition of liquid nitrogen increased the disruption fraction to 94.77 0.72 . This signiﬁcant increase is due to the sudden freezing of microalgae cells rendering the cell wall brittle thus aiding the release of intracellular lipid. On the other hand Meullemiestre 114 found that bead milling showed better extracted lipid quality as compared to ultrasonic and microwave methods. Ultrasonication is a promising technique as it facilitates the mixing of solutions and does not require high temperatures to disrupt cell walls 115 . This technique utilises sound waves to propagate pressure ﬂuc- tuations that induces cavitation 116 . X. Zhang 117 studied the use of ultrasonic assistance for biodiesel production of Trichosporon oleagi- nosus sludge and found that the duration was shortened by 23 h with a yield of 95 . Gerde 115 found that by increasing the sonication power the extraction of intracellular products also increases but may also led to poorer quality of lipid because of lipid oxidation. Ad- ditionally Natarajan 118 concluded that ultrasonic lipid extraction may be eﬃcient for rigid walled microalgae such as Chlorella sp. but species with ﬂexible walls such as T. suecica and Nannochloropsis sp. the cell walls tend to coil up and retain membrane lipids. Therefore ul- trasonic assisted methods are only suitable for microalgae species with rigid cell walls. Microwave assisted techniques oﬀers rapid and even heating which uses minimal amount of solvents and requires a shorter heating dura- tion 119 . It is comparable to ultrasonic methods as both methods increase lipid yields and reduce extraction time. Microwave energy oﬀers a more eﬀective heating due to faster energy transfer and reduces thermal gradients. Additionally it also demonstrates selective heating uses smaller equipment size and most importantly microwave assisted technique increases production and eliminates process steps 120 . Guldhe 121 compared both ultrasonic and microwave lipid ex- tractions on sun dried Scenedesmus sp. and found that the microwave method had higher lipid yields 28.33 g-1 of dry cell weight com- pared to ultrasonic method. Dai 119 also arrived at the same con- clusion that microwave method oﬀers better lipid extraction than ultrasonic method in their experiment the highest oil yield of 30 wt was extracted from microalgae frond using microwave method. Al- though ultrasonication and microwave have commendable advantages to conventional extraction both have diﬃculties in extracting from dense medium which will aﬀect scalability of these processes 122 . Chemical or physical treatments are found to induce excessive heat and stress on cells which may decrease cell viability 123 . Electric pulse treatment produces pulsed electric ﬁelds to aﬀect the membrane properties of a biological cell. Under application of an electric ﬁeld the external cell membranes will receive an increase of transmembrane voltage that increases the membrane s permeability and conductivity 124 . Electric pulse treatment is also known as electroporation. Elec- troporation is highly selective and allows release of intracellular matter while the extraction of lipid will require use of solvent 125 . Jaeschke 126 achieved 83 lipid yield from Heterochlorella luteoviridis under moderate electric ﬁeld and ethanol pre-treatment. Meanwhile Garoma Janda 127 reported that lipid extraction for Chlorella vulgaris using electroporation exhibited low lipid yields 5.3 . However this method obtained the highest energy gain per energy input compared to microwave and ultrasonic methods with n-hexane methanol water solvent solution. Cell homogenization eliminates the need for cost intensive drying and can be scaled to be used in large volumes 128 . Halim 129 found that Chlorococcum sp. 73.8 of cell disruption were achieved using cell homogenization which was higher than acid treatment bead beating and ultrasonic methods. On the contrary for Chlorella vulgaris dos Santos 130 found that homogenization 16 showed poorer lipid yields than ultrasonic methods 19 under similar solvent conditions. Sudden depressurization technique is also a common cell disruption method used to obtain intracellular compounds. During static com- pression a diﬀusible gas such as supercritical carbon dioxide is allowed to penetrate the cell wall until saturation is achieved before a sudden depressurization is initiated. A sharp pressure gradient is formed along the cell wall where the gas expanded that result in high disruption ef- ﬁciency 131 . The main advantage of sudden depressurization is that the process is free from toxic solvents 132 . When the decompression rate is increased the eﬃciency of disruption will also increase since it induces a higher pressure drop along the cell wall 133 . Halim et al. 134 found that the use of supercritical carbon dioxide was able to Cell Disruption Techniques Mechanical Conventional mechanical pressing Ultrasonic assistance Microwave assistance Electric pulse Cell homogenization Sudden depressurization Non-mechanical Conventional chemical solvents Acids Nanoparticles Supercritical fluids Ionic liquid Biological enzymes Fig. 2. Types of cell disruption techniques. B.H.H. Goh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 107 2019 59 74 64 shorten the Chlorococcum sp. lipid extraction time by 5.6 times in comparison to conventional Soxhlet extraction. Despite numerous studies on the mechanical modes of lipid ex- traction all methods have its limitations. The thick cell walls of mi- croalgae make conventional mechanical pressing ineﬃcient. Ultrasonication and microwave produce impressive lipid yields but both encounter diﬃculties from dense mediums extraction which might not be suitable for industrial setting. In addition electric pulse treatment cell homogenization and sudden depressurization are energy intensive methods which increase the cost of production of microalgae biodiesel. 3.2.2. Non-mechanical methods Besides mechanical methods of lipid extraction other methods of lipid extraction include the use of chemicals or enzymes to disrupt the cell wall. Chemical or biological materials interact with the cell mem- branes to allow direct passage of intercellular components to the sur- rounding 135 . Lipid extraction eﬃciency depends on the use of non- polar and polar solvents 136 . For microalgae lipid extraction polar solvents are paired with non-polar solvents to ensure total extraction of all neutral lipids which include free-standing globules and membrane associated complexes 137 . Commercially lipid extraction has been conducted with solvents such as ethanol methanol hexane and chloroform. The Bligh and Dyer method is one of the common methods used for lipid extraction where a two-phase system is created and lipid will be fractioned in the chloroform phase 138 . However not all solvents are safe for the en- vironment. One major drawback of conventional solvents such as hexane and chloroform is their toxicity and adverse eﬀect to the en- vironment 116 . In addition these solvents also aﬀect the quality of product by dissolving unwanted products such as chlorophyll 139 . Table 4 shows the common types of solvent used for lipid extraction of various feedstocks. Ideally extraction solvent should be highly speciﬁc to lipid but volatile enough to ensure low energy distillation and easy separation from lipid 116 . Considering the health and environmental issues as- sociated with conventional solvents new environmentally friendly and sustainable solvents have been introduced for microalgae lipid extrac- tion such as acid nanoparticle supercritical ﬂuid ionic liquid and biological enzyme. Acid mediated cell disruption is often accompanied with heat. The strong acid will catalyse the hydrolysis of bio-component at elevated temperatures 151 . J.-Y. Park et. al 152 found that 1 sulphuric acid heated at 120 °C for 60 min increased lipid yields of Chlorella vulgaris by approximately 4 times. On the other hand I. Lee et. al 151 found that increasing nitric acid concentration lead to decrease in lipid yields of Nannochloropsis salina. The use of acids at accurate concentrations should be studied along with microalgae strains for eﬃcient lipid ex- traction. Nanoparticles can easily penetrate and interact with biomolecules due to their size. Abdul Razack 153 found that silver nanoparticles cause cell wall damage to Chlorella vulgaris and are suitable for lipid extraction. Zinc oxide nanoparticles are also able to increase the per- meability of cellular membranes and depolarise cells 154 . W.-C. Huang Kim 155 studied the use of nickel oxide nanoparticles for Chlorella vulgaris lipid extraction and found a 208 increase in ex- traction eﬃciency. However the synthesis cost environmental con- cerns and reusability of nanoparticles have yet to be fully addressed for commercial applications of these technologies 156 . Supercritical ﬂuids have emerged as an interesting alternative to conventional solvents due to their low viscosity high diﬀusivity easy separation high dissolving power and low surface tension 157 . Su- percritical CO2 is the most widely used supercritical ﬂuid for extraction of bio-compounds and is recyclable 158 . S. Tang 159 achieved 33.9 lipid yield from Schizochytrium limacinum powder with ethanol 95 and supercritical CO2 5 as extraction solvents. Millao Uquiche 160 studied the eﬀects of supercritical CO2 on Nanno- chloropsis gaditana lipid extraction and found that temperature and CO2 density increase lead to higher lipid and carotenoid yields. In order to make supercritical CO2 lipid extraction process more economical si- multaneous lipid and carotenoid extraction have been explored. Ionic liquids are green organic solvents that are non-volatile and possess good thermal stability 161 . Ionic liquid has been applied to not only extract lipid but also to recover other valuable compounds such as proteins and polysaccharides from wet biomass 162 . Choi 163 compared the lipid yields of Chlorella vulgaris with organic sol- vents and ionic liquids and found that 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium acetate 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium diethylphosphate 1-ethyl-3- methyl imidazolium tetraﬂuoroborate and 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazo- lium chloride showed high lipid yields of more than 200 mg g cell compared to 185.4 mg g cell achieved by the conventional hexane- methanol solvent. However there are cases where certain ionic liquids resulted in lower lipid yield than conventional organic solvents. In addition Olkiewicz 162 found that ionic liquids showed better ex- traction yields from raw sludge than dried sludge which would elim- inate the need for costly drying process. Enzyme can facilitates the recovery of lipid by selective degradation of cell wall and membrane while preserving most labile compounds 164 . Published studies have concluded that proper enzyme selection and optimal process conditions determination are essential for eﬀective enzymatic treatment 165 . Sierra 108 found that lipid yield of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii incubated with autolysin was found to be Table 4 Conventional solvents for lipid extraction.

Goh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 107 2019 59 74 65 30 higher than without biomass treatment. High lipid extraction 88.3 was achieved from slurry of Nannochloropsis oceanica with the use of thermal lysin Aspergillus niger cellulose and surfactants 166 . The combination of several cell disruption methods may help increase lipid yields from microalgae. However it should be noted that enzymes should not be exposed to mechanical thermal or chemical stress to ensure reusability. Lipid extraction using solvents can be done on either dry or wet biomass. However extraction of lipid from dry biomass is usually more eﬃcient 135 . The drying process is energy and cost intensive but wet extraction usually resulted in lower yield due to the tendency of mi- croalgae cells to remain in the water phase and not interact with the organic solvents used for lipid extraction 167 . Considering the scale up diﬃculty faced by mechanical modes of lipid extraction the solvent method is usually more suitable for commercial use as it is less energy intensive and has shown to produce higher yields of lipid extraction 167 . Balasubramanian et al. 168 studied factors aﬀecting lipid ex- traction from marine microalgae such as biomass drying method moisture content and solvent extraction system. They discovered that drying method had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on lipid yield but it would aﬀect the total free fatty acid produced. Therefore choosing the right kind of solvent for microalgae cell wall disruption is important to en- sure optimum lipid yield. Another technique that avoids the use of harmful solvents for lipid extraction and utilises less energy is in-situ transesteriﬁcation where lipid is transesteriﬁed directly from the mi- croalgae biomass 4. Direct biodiesel synthesis from microalgae biomass Conventionally biodiesel is produced from extracted lipids. Lipid extraction is costly as it requires the breaking of cell wall and normally this includes the dewatering process which is also energy intensive 169 . A life cycle analysis found that drying and extraction processes accumulated to 90 of the total biodiesel production costs 170 . The transesteriﬁcation process developed several decades ago is con- sidered to be highly eﬃcient 171 . It has been successfully applied in commercial biodiesel production and has a stable conversion eﬃciency of above 95 17 . Conventionally the transesteriﬁcation reaction involves blending of alcohol with vegetable oil in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction will convert the oil to a methyl or ethyl ester biodiesel and glycerol 171 . The choice of alcohol and catalyst is dependent on nature and type of feedstock used 172 . The combina- tion of lipid extraction solvent recovery and transesteriﬁcation into a single step provides a more economical alternative for biodiesel pro- duction. In recent years many researchers have work on the direct biodiesel synthesis of wet or dry microalgae biomass and some studies has found that higher moisture content reduces the biodiesel yield 173 . In the direct biodiesel synthesis from microalgae biomass al- cohol acts as the extraction solvent as well as the transesteriﬁcation reactant 174 . The use of co-solvent may help improve the process eﬃciency by acting as an extraction agent and forming homogenous system between the microalgae oil alcohol and catalyst 175 . Direct biodiesel synthesis eliminates the loss of lipids where all lipids are converted to biodiesel and oﬀers the concurrent production of valuable co-products such as ethyl levulinate ethyl formate diethyl ether and glycerolcarbonate 23 . Common species of microalgae being studied for direct biodiesel synthesis include Chlorella spp. and Nannochloropsis spp.. Lemoes et. al 176 found that direct biodiesel synthesis had higher ethyl and methyl ester yields than the conventional extraction-transesteriﬁcation process. Ghosh 177 also found that the combination of extraction and trans- esteriﬁcation using acid catalyst for Chlorella sp. MJ11 11 yielded more biodiesel than a two-step process. However Chen 178 observed that direct transesteriﬁcation from biomass would require a higher catalyst loading when compared to the transesteriﬁcation of extracted oils. There are several parameters which aﬀect the biodiesel yield from single step transesteriﬁcation which include application of catalyst ultrasonic or microwave technologies and use of supercritical alcohols. Table 5 shows the direct biodiesel synthesis from microalgae biomass using conventional methods. 4.1. Catalyst Selection of catalyst is an important step for high biodiesel yields. Conventional catalysts for biodiesel production include base or acid catalyst which depends on the fatty acid content of the oil. A base catalysed reaction occurs by creating a nucleophilic alkoxide from the alcohol to attack the electrophilic part of the carbonyl group of trigly- cerides whereas in an acid catalysed reaction the carbonyl group of triglycerides is protonated and the alcohol will attack the protonated carbon to create a tetrahedral intermediate 188 . The drawback of acid catalysed transesteriﬁcation is the low yield compared to conventional base catalysed 189 . Base catalyst demonstrates faster reaction kinetics than acid catalysed but are only suitable in the biodiesel synthesis of lower free fatty acid content lipids 0.5 190 . Microalgae lipids have been known to contain high levels of free fatty acid up to 70 wt depending on storage conditions and require the use of acid catalyst during transesteriﬁcation 191 . Homogenous catalysts are diﬃcult to separate from product due to their homogeneity incurring additional cost for product puriﬁcation and at the same time creating extra waste Table 5 Direct biodiesel synthesis from microalgae biomass using conventional methods.

Goh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 107 2019 59 74 66 192 . Therefore heterogeneous catalyst is the better choice as it eliminates the need for catalyst recovery reducing the cost of biodiesel production 169 . Table 6 shows the direct biodiesel synthesis using various heterogeneous catalysts. The use of calcium oxide CaO catalyst which can be synthesized from egg shells mollusc shells chicken bone oyster and mud crab shell is gaining much attention for biodiesel production 199 . Calcium oxide catalyst recycles shell waste from being disposed and its usage also increases the commercial value of seafood production 200 . The cat- alytic capacity of CaO in transesteriﬁcation is dependent on the ex- istence of basic sites and their spatial dispersion 201 . Nevertheless because CaO is a basic catalyst and it can only be used for transester- iﬁcation of microalgae with low free fatty acid content. Microalgae biomass that contains high free fatty acid content can be transesteriﬁed by acid or enzymatic catalyst. Research has found that lipases work at lower temperature 25 50 °C and the subsequent separation of bio- diesel and glycerol is relatively easier 202 . Lipase catalyst is applied in the transesteriﬁcation of vegetable oils but rarely on microalgae biomass. There is also a favourable trend of using lipase in biodiesel pro- duction due to its high production rate and low cost 203 . Guldhe 204 optimised the transesteriﬁcation of lipid from Scenedesmus ob- liquus using immobilized Aspergillus niger as catalyst and obtained a 90.82 conversion yield. However the use of extracellular lipases re- quires an immobilisation process and the subsequent recovery and puriﬁcation are also costly and diﬃcult 202 . The use of hetero- geneous catalyst allows for easy catalyst recovery as alcohols do not mix with the solid catalyst 205 . Therefore heterogeneous catalyst looks like a promising approach to microalgae biodiesel commerciali- sation. 4.2. Process intensiﬁcation Besides the use of catalyst microwave or ultrasonic assistance during transesteriﬁcation also improves biodiesel synthesis eﬃciency. The use of ultrasonic assisted acid catalysed transesteriﬁcation on mi- croalgae feedstock is rarely studied. Most microalgae biodiesel direct transesteriﬁcation utilises microwave assistance. Teo 206 reported that microalgae biodiesel produced with microwave assistance showed higher lubricating property good cetane number and shorter carbon chain FAME compared to biodiesel produced using the conventional method. Similar to lipid extraction methods sonication encourages better lipid solubilisation. Martinez 175 found that ultrasonic assis- tance improved yield of biodiesel from transesteriﬁcation of Spirulina sp. and a higher lipid recovery. On the other hand microwave allows selective heating faster energy transfer and thus more eﬃcient heating 207 . Table 7 shows the major diﬀerences with microwave and ultrasonic technologies. Koberg 197 compared the ultrasonic and microwave assistance on Nannochloropsis microalgae and obtained better yields from the mi- crowave assisted process. Cheng 181 found that the kinetic rate of direct biodiesel synthesis with microwave assistance was 6 times faster than the conventional extraction-transesteriﬁcation of Chlorella pyr- enoidosa oil. Sharma 214 optimised biodiesel production from Chlorella vulgaris under microwave irradiation and achieved an 84.01 yield. Meanwhile Ma et. al 215 utilised heterogeneous catalyst KF CaO in an ultrasonic-microwave synergistic extraction apparatus and obtained a maximum biodiesel yield of 93.07 2.39 . The use of a synergized setup as such may be a viable option as it allows testing of both technologies for any selected microalgae to achieve maximum biodiesel yields. 4.3. Supercritical conditions The transesteriﬁcation process can also be conducted under super- critical conditions which eliminate the use of catalyst thus avoid the production of pollutants 216 . Non-catalytic transesteriﬁcation re- quires elevated temperature to beyond the critical temperature of the alcohol to form a homogenous reaction phase but does not need to be in the supercritical state 217 . Supercritical methanol has been widely used in the transesteriﬁcation of several feedstock such as rapeseed oil 218 palm oil 219 Jatropha oil 220 and waste vegetable oil 221 . Although this process produces high yield of biodiesel the stringent reaction conditions often pose a challenge towards the eﬃcient scale up of the production 222 . Methanol in supercritical conditions breaks the rigid microalgae cell walls and allows for solvent diﬀusion into lipid simultaneously 33 . The direct transesteriﬁcation of microalgae bio- mass can also utilise ethanol as a biodegradable replacement for me- thanol where similar yields were reported for both fatty acid alkyl esters 176 . The addition of carbon dioxide to supercritical methanol lowers the reaction temperature 223 . Several researchers have re- ported the use of supercritical methanol for microalgae biodiesel pro- duction. Table 8 shows studies on supercritical transesteriﬁcation of microalgae biomass. Since methanol is toxic and non-renewable longer chain alcohols such as ethanol isopropanol and butanol are introduced as potential alcohol replacements. The use of longer chain alcohols also improves the cold ﬂow properties and oxidation stability of the produced bio- diesel 232 .

However the super- critical method produces a higher quality biodiesel free from harmful pollutants since no catalyst was used. In situ transesteriﬁcation may reduce the number of steps needed for biodiesel production but it also wastes valuable nutrient in the remnants. Zhou 233 utilised supercritical carbon dioxide to recover high value components from the residue of Chrysophyta sp. and Chlor- ella sp. after transesteriﬁcation. Jazzar 227 also reported that super- critical methanol was used in the single step isolation cultivation and transesteriﬁcation of Chlorella sp. and Nannochloris sp.. For most su- percritical cases the optimised reaction parameters are often similar for diﬀerent species of microalgae. Therefore the biodiesel yields are often aﬀected by lipid content of the microalgae species itself. 5. Challenges and future prospect of third generation biodiesel The third generation biodiesel or microalgae derived biodiesel avoids the use of agricultural land as microalgae can be grown in arable land due to its robust environmental adaptability 234 . The use of microalgae as a biodiesel feedstock is more sustainable in terms of food security and environmental impact. However the transition to third generation biodiesel usage is still vague and requires more research to become sustainable. Fig. 3 shows various obstacles to be overcome before microalgae biodiesel can be commercialised. An eﬃcient and proﬁtable microalgae biodiesel production should utilise a high lipid productivity microalgae strain which can be culti- vated in a sustainable environment and with the ability to produce other valuable by products. Therefore it is important to reorient re- search and development to focus on these properties. In addition the socioeconomic problems and opportunities of microalgae biodiesel should be evaluated prior to commercialisation. 5.1. Technical challenges Several factors such as environmental tolerance high growth rate high lipid content and easy harvesting and extraction are important when choosing an all-rounder species of microalgae 235 . The se- lection of a suitable strain marked the start of an in-depth study into microalgae biodiesel production. Table 9 shows the summarised se- lection matrix for an all-rounder microalgae species. A high percentage of biodiesel production cost is due to the feed- stock. Current biodiesel production cost is calculated to be 4.4 times the price of petroleum derived biodiesel 238 . Microalgae-based biodiesel commercialisation faces various obstacles in terms of harsh cultivation conditions and the complicated and often costly harvesting and oil extraction method 239 . Lipid productivity cultivation and down- stream processing are the deciding factors in microalgae biodiesel economics. Genetically modiﬁed microalgae for enhanced lipid pro- ductivity have potential but are still in research stage. The concept of co-cultivation between microalgae species may also help improve lipid yields while not aﬀecting biomass growth 240 . Microalgae can be cultivated in wastewater or seawater eliminating the need for fertili- zers and at the same time can be used for wastewater remediation 241 . Microalgae with high CO2 tolerance can also be cultivated using industrial ﬂue gas high levels of carbon dioxide sulphur and nitrogen oxides as a strategy for CO2 mitigation 35 . Direct biodiesel synthesis from biomass is found to be the most cost eﬀective process in- tensiﬁcation method because it combines oil extraction and transes- teriﬁcation into a single step 237 . Given the enormous potential of microalgae biodiesel it is necessary that proper policy is implemented to support eﬃcient commercialisation. China the world s second highest oil consumer produces only 15 of its biodiesel need due to lack of policies and regulations that en- courage the use of biodiesel 242 . As of now the biodiesel policies implemented around the world are for ﬁrst and second generation biodiesels. The implications of biodiesel policies are huge aﬀecting not only the oil prices food prices and consumer welfare but they also alter the income distribution 243 . Given to that any policies pertaining to third generation biodiesel must be thoroughly studied and discussed to prevent undesirable consequences that will impact the society 244 . Consistent monitoring on the cultivation and maintenance of micro- algae biodiesel production plants will also prevent policy failures such Table 7 Diﬀerence between ultrasonic and microwave assistance. Ultrasonic assistance Microwave assistance High temperature and pressure conditions create free radicals which cause reaction to occur instantly 208 Microwaves create electromagnetic ﬁelds which align polar molecules and create heat due to friction from slower orientation of molecules and time rate change of the ﬁelds 209 . High temperature high pressure acoustic microstreaming turbulence and high shear forces generate ﬁner emulsions between immiscible ﬂuids which enhance mass transfer and transesteriﬁcation reaction rates 210 . Microwave technology allows rapid safe and cost eﬀective microalgae biodiesel production without the need of drying 207 . Ultrasonic can also help in the extraction of valuable components such as pigments and carotenoids 189 . Microwave heating reduces analysis time simpliﬁes manipulation and creates higher purity products 120 . Approximately 5000 K and 100 MPa produced during collapse of ultrasonic bubbles 211 . Short chain alcohols Methanol or ethanol have strong polarity and are active microwave absorption media 212 . Microwave technology has been upraised to work on a continuous ﬂow pattern in an energy eﬃcient manner 213 . Table 8 Supercritical transesteriﬁcation of microalgae biomass.

The long-term stability of microalgae products should also be stu- died because organic compounds can easily degrade due to high tem- perature light and presence of other inhibitors such as oxidation ac- celerators. Oxidative stress can cause the accumulation reactive oxidative species in high amount that will cause damage to the mi- croalgae cells and reduce lipid production 246 . Therefore it is im- portant to conduct life cycle analysis on not only the biodiesel but on other valuable microalgae products as well to determine the sustain- ability of the process. Biodiesel are susceptible to oxidation during long term storage 247 and all generations of biodiesel degrade naturally due to oxidation causing increase in acidity and viscosity. Recent re- search have investigated the use of additives such as antioxidants phytohormone and oxygen vector to reduce oxidative damage 246 . 5.2. Future prospects The potential of modiﬁed microalgae as feedstock face numerous challenges such as variation of culture growth conditions low pro- ductivity and overwhelming capital investment and operation 248 . The most common species of microalgae used for genetic engineering is Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This species has been studied extensively and its genome sequenced 249 . Shin 250 increased the lipid pro- ductivity of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by 64.25 achieved through targeted knockout of phospholipase A2. The current genetic engineering studies on microalgae lipid production have been focused on single gene overexpression or deletion but it is not known whether this will be the most eﬀective way of enhancing lipid accumulation while reg- ulating cell metabolism. Sun et al. 251 reviewed various approaches of microalgae lipid enhancement via metabolic engineering and found that multi-gene manipulation is more advantageous than single gene editing. However multi-gen manipulation is still in the infancy stage of research. Microalgae utilizing its simple cell structure and rapid growth rate has a CO2 bio-ﬁxation eﬃciency of 10 15 times higher than terrestrial plants 252 . Wastewater loaded with nitrogen and phosphorus is sui- table nutrient sources for microalgae growth. It is estimated that roughly 16.67 times more carbon can be stored in diluted suspensions of microalgae 10 kg of biomass per m3 than in gas form CO2 253 . However the several challenges of wastewater based microalgae cul- tivation include variation of wastewater composition toxic con- tamination and presence of suspended particles that aﬀect light trans- mission eﬃciency 34 . Mehrabadi 254 suggested that a method to reduce microalgae biodiesel production costs is the utilisation of biomass from wastewater treatment in high rate algae ponds. Lee 255 predicted that algal biofuel could supply 7.1 of developed world fuel demand by 2040 and 0.5 in developing countries with strong government support. Kova- cevic 256 estimated that algae biofuel could cost 51.60 euros GJ by 2020 if technological advancements remained linear and crude oil re- mained at 100 barrel. However lipid production from microalgae cultivated in treated wastewater shows poor net energy recovery when both the lipid energy content and light requirement are considered 257 . Several companies such as Sapphire energy Heliae and Solazyme shifted from the com- mercialisation of microalgae biofuels to other ﬁelds food nutrition water treatment to stay aﬂoat 258 . This suggests that microalgae cultivation solely for biodiesel production is impossible. The development of microalgae biodiesel industries cannot be sus- tained without government support. Currently the production biodiesel is economically viable due to various government policies that support the commercialisation via tax credits subsidies import tariﬀs and targets appointed 244 . Similar eﬀorts should be plan prior to the commercialisation of third generation biodiesel. Reduction in equip- ment taxes provisional training and learning sessions for farmers and other subsidies are important for the successful industrialisation of microalgae biodiesel 258 . Under beneﬁcial energy policies and in- vestments the development of biodiesel will be encouraged while production and consumption will also signiﬁcantly increase 242 . Brazil s National Program for Biodiesel Production and Uses PNPB policy has recently introduced tax reductions for biodiesel production for various feedstock which may increase people s interest in micro- algae cultivation due to its high lipid productivity in non-arable land 259 . Other eﬀorts include the United States introduction of title IX of the EISA Energy Independence and Security Act 2017 which provides grants and loans for the commercial production of microalgae biodiesel. Microalgae contains high value bio products such as pigments vi- tamins and antioxidants that can be extracted and exploited 248 . Selection of suitable microalgae strain with enhanced growth characteristics and high lipid content Cultivation strategy with high biomass productivity that utilises wastewater for nutrients Harvesting strategy and lipid extraction methods depending on microalgae strains and the co-production of valuable bioproduct Fig. 3. Steps for eﬃcient microalgae biodiesel production process. Table 9 Biodiesel selection matrix for all-rounder microalgae species. Factors Preferred characteristics Biomass Growth Rate Fast growth rate for rapid accumulation of biomass which will increase the yield per harvest and reduce risks of contamination 234 . Lipid Content High lipid content corresponds to a higher amount of biodiesel that can produced from the microalgae strain 234 . Free Fatty Acid FFA Content FFA content less than 0.5 wt to avoid soap formation reduce catalyst usage and avoid complicated phase separation 17 . Environmental Tolerance Easy acclimatization to unconducive open environments and resistant to contamination 95 . Growth Medium The use of bio-fertilizers are preferred over chemical fertilizers and can also accelerate the microalgae metabolism 236 . Harvesting Methods Ideal harvesting methods should be suitable for most microalgae strains and achieve high biomass recovery with minimal cost and energy use 95 . Potential for Direct Biodiesel Synthesis from Biomass Direct conversion of microalgae biomass into biodiesel reduces the economic and environmental impact due to reduced processing steps and solvents used 237 . B.H.H. Goh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 107 2019 59 74 69 Bioreﬁnery is an industrial scale facility where biomass and its inter- mediates are converted to valuable products such as chemicals mate- rials and energy products 260 . For industrial scale application mi- croalgae strains should contain high value products and strong environmental adaptability properties and cost-eﬀective bioreﬁneries should utilise low-cost techniques such as nutrient limitations 246 . While biofuel production is the main objective of microalgae compa- nies the production of other high value products is crucial for com- panies to remain proﬁtable in the short term 258 . The introduction of microalgae biodiesel market may also aﬀect conventional algae product markets. There is no concrete evidence whether this new market will boost or shrink conventional applications such as cosmetics and che- micals. However Zhu 260 stated that microalgae-based fuel will cause competition with conventional microalgae uses which will cause recession in the original industrial applications. A hybrid reﬁnery may be the most proﬁtable venture rather than an exclusively product- based or energy-based reﬁnery 261 . 6. Conclusion The review discusses the factors that inﬂuence biodiesel production from microalgae the challenges it face and future prospect. All key factors aﬀecting microalgae cultivation lipid accumulation harvesting cell disruption extraction and biodiesel synthesis were critically ana- lysed. Biodiesel from microalgae also provides a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuel. It is essential to in- corporate these technical ﬁndings with economic analysis to ensure feasibility of biodiesel production. For microalgae biodiesel production to remain sustainable the biomass should be cultivated in lipid indu- cing culture followed by eﬃcient harvesting and ﬁnally the biodiesel synthesis that combines both lipid extraction and transesteriﬁcation. Overall the use of microalgae as biodiesel feedstock is technically feasible but not economically viable. The production of microalgae biodiesel in the form of a hybrid reﬁnery along with production of conventional microalgae products can improve the marketability of microalgae. However more research should be done on long term stability and technical aspects of a hybrid reﬁnery.

Plant and microalgae based feedstocks are prominent and are studied extensively. Plant based feedstocks cultivated as monoculture on wastelands and trees in forests can cater towards partial fulﬁllment of feedstock requirements for biodiesel industry. Synthesis of biodiesel from microalgal oil has gathered immense interest and has potential to cater to the increasing feedstocks demands of the biodiesel industry. The major advantage offered by microalgal oil as compared to plant based oils is its potential for culture on non-arable land. Despite of the advantages of microalgal oil as a feedstock for biodiesel there are constraints that have to be overcome in order to make it economical and sustainable. Sustainable approaches for both the plant and microalgae as feedstocks have been drawn. Despite there being several plant species few have been found to be desirable as feedstocks for biodiesel production based on their lipid proﬁles. Among the microalgae there are thousands of species and several of these have been cultured for extracting the oil to explore their feasibility in utilization as biodiesel feedstocks. Though several of the microalgal species have shown potential for high biomass growth and lipid productivity only a few have been found to provide a high biodiesel yield and conversion. Due to the several steps involved in the extraction of oil which are energy intensive the cost of biodiesel from microalgal oil is high as compared with that obtained from the plant oils. A sustainable approach for utilizing plant and microalgal oils as feedstocks for biodiesel have been discussed. The emerging cost effective methods in production of biodiesel have been described. The energy return and greenhouse gas emissions from biodiesel have been outlined. Together the plant oil and microalgal oil can offer potential source of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Contents 1.

Introduction The world s anticipated energy requirement for 2030 shall be 50 more than it is today. The transportation sector alone accounts for 30 of the world s total energy consumption and the last three decades have witnessed a steep rise in the number of transporta- tion vehicles worldwide most of which are private car 1 . The global energy demand in the transportation sector is expected to grow by 2 per year. This would lead to 80 higher emissions in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in comparison to that of 2002 levels 2 . The combustion of diesel and gasoline derived from crude oil in compression ignition CI and spark ignition SI vehicles emits carbon dioxide along with hydrocar- bons particulate matter carbon monoxide oxides of nitrogen and other carcinogens that pose direct and indirect dangers to man- kind and ecosystems. Worldwide concern regarding the increase in carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere as well as the dwindling reserves of crude oil have led to the development of renewable fuels. Despite the differences in opinion on the amount of crude oil available its exhaustion in coming years seems inevitable. The renewable sources of energy including solar wind ocean hydropower geothermal and biomass have the capability to provide alternative sources of clean energy 3 . Baring biomass and solar energy these renewable energy sources are place speciﬁc and hence can be utilized only at locations that are suitable for their harnessing. Another source of renewable fuel that has received attention worldwide due to its compatibility as a fuel in a compression ignition CI engine is biodiesel. In 2008 the global production of biodiesel was 12 billion litres increasing to 17 and 19 billion litres in 2009 and 2010 respectively 4 . Biodiesel is produced from a wide variety of raw materials comprising of triglycerides as major component by either ester- iﬁcation or transesteriﬁcation or both depending on the acid value of the feedstock and the type of catalyst acid or alkaline used for its synthesis. A feedstock in the terminology of biodiesel has been well deﬁned by Sun et al. 5 as the raw material from which oils and fats are derived . Biodiesel has been blended with mineral diesel up to 20 and has been used as fuel in CI engines possessing a comparable caloriﬁc value to mineral diesel. As biodiesel is compatible with mineral diesel it can even be used in neat form thus proving an alternate to mineral diesel with few if any modiﬁcations in CI engines 6 . Biodiesel emits lower exhaust emissions on its combustion as compared to mineral diesel and have shown a comparable performance as that with mineral diesel and aviation fuel 7 . Owing to its renewability and sustainability the production of biodiesel has gradually increased in recent years. The wide spectrum of feedstocks that can be used to synthesize biodiesel are edible oils usually wherever in surplus non-edible oils waste cooking oils waste frying oils animal or ﬁsh waste oil and microalgae oil 8 9 . Approximately 7 of edible vegetable oils globally have been reported to be diverted to the production of biodiesel in 2007 10 . Borugadda and Goud 11 reports that among the plant origin oils edible oil contributes 95 of the feedstock constituent for the production of biodiesel. The advan- tage of edible oil as a feedstock for production of biodiesel is their low free fatty acid FFA content i.e. 41 which allow single step transesteriﬁcation of the oil 12 . Edible oil feedstocks that are used worldwide in synthesis of biodiesel are soybean rapeseed palm and sunﬂower 13 . However with the shrinking arable land availability and the worldwide concern over the fuel versus food debate it does not seem justiﬁed to divert edible oil to the production of biofuels. The limited availability of the edible oil in many developing and undeveloped nations pose a question mark to the continuance of production of biodiesel from edible oils. Non-edible oils waste cooking frying oil animal fats and micro- algal oil contain a high FFA 44 content which has to undergo acid esteriﬁcation so that they do not saponify as with the alkali catalysts. Several solid acid catalysts have been developed and used for the simultaneous esteriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation of the FFA and triglycerides present in oil fat in the feedstock. Exploring the possibilities of the non-edible feedstocks Balat 10 reported on the feasibility of a few non-edible plant species to be efﬁcient in the production of biodiesel. These include Jatropha curcas Pongamia pinnata Madhuca indica and several other plant species along with the microalgal oil. Singh 14 has also reported on the feasibility of P. pinnata and M. indica along with a novel feedstock Schleichera triguga to have a high potential for conversion to biodiesel with a high yield. The advantage of the plant and microalgal based feedstocks is that they are diverse in terms of species and strains . So if one of the feedstocks is scanty the demand can be fulﬁlled by an alternative feedstock. However there is a disadvantage with the usage of some of these feedstocks as at least a few of them have alternate applications in medicine soap manufacture and other useful applications. These plant derived oils also have a low energy density and are not economical in present scenario as compared to mineral diesel. The non-edible oils utilized in the pharmaceutical and soap industries B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 217 and have other applications 15 . The waste cooking frying oil and waste animal ﬁsh oil are too scanty to support a large or medium scale biodiesel plant. Algae as a feedstock for biodiesel are in the preliminary stages of research but have shown immense potential to provide alternative and a new generation feedstock. The lipid productivity of microalgae with respect to the dry weight of biomass can be 15 to 300 times greater than that derived from plants 16 . However their cultivation and extraction of oil along with optimiza- tion of the important parameters light pH temperature nutrients for a high yield of oil with low cost is presently a challenge. The transesteriﬁcation reaction for the synthesis of biodiesel involves reaction of oil or fat as triglycerides with a lower group alcohol preferably methanol or ethanol due to their high reactiv- ity owing to shorter chain length in presence of an acid or alkali catalyst. Esteriﬁcation is the process adopted for the conversion of FFA content in oil fats to fatty acid alkyl ester FAAE in presence of an acid catalyst. Hence with feedstock containing high FFA content a two step process comprising of esteriﬁcation followed by transesteriﬁcation is usually adopted 17 . The preference of methanol over ethanol as alcohol is due to the higher reactivity and lower cost of the former. To enhance the rate of reaction a catalyst homogeneous or heterogeneous is compulsorily added. The only case where the catalyst is usually not added is when the esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation reaction is done at supercritical conditions 15 . A supercritical method is the technique by which at a high temperature and pressure the dielectric constant of the reactant alcohol in the present case is reduced to facilitate the formation of a single phase as compared to the usual two phases of oil and alcohol. The advantage with supercritical method is that the puriﬁcation or separation steps are not required 18 19 . However the process requires high energy consumption due to high temperature requirement and is not economically feasible. The product obtained after transesteriﬁcation of oil or fat primarily comprises of FAAE and is termed as biodiesel . A useful co-product glycerol is also obtained which has numerous indus- trial applications in food cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries 19 . After separation glycerol is puriﬁed for its usage in industrial applications. The biodiesel is puriﬁed separately to remove the un- reacted components and by-products that are formed during the reaction viz. soap residual alcohol glycerol tri- di- monoglycer- ides water and catalyst. The high price of biodiesel is attributed to the limited avail- ability of the feedstocks edible non-edible oil which have other useful applications medicine soap manufacture human con- sumption and limited availability of arable land for cultivation of biofuel crops. The only feedstocks that does not have alternate application or very limited application is the waste cooking frying oil waste animal and ﬁsh fats but their availability to support large demand to feedstock is not documented at present and is scanty to support a biofuel industry. The feedstock thus plays an important role in the synthesis of biodiesel. At present plant oils edible and non-edible have been extensively used for the production of biodiesel because of their easy availability and high saponiﬁcation value that enables transesteriﬁcation. Recently the alternative feedstocks viz. animal fats waste cooking frying oil and oil from microbial species have also been explored for synthesis of biodie- sel 20 . The future of biodiesel as a prominent transport fuel lies in the easy of availability of the feedstock. Animal fat and waste cooking frying oil has limited availability and hence the focus is on the plant and microalgae based oil. This review deals with the various aspects of microalgae and plant oils for the synthesis of biodiesel and discusses the potential of plant and microalgae based feedstocks for the production of biodiesel and the recent approaches to their sustainability. The present review also deals with the extraction of lipids conversion by transesteriﬁcation effect of feedstock lipids on fuel properties. Limitations and constraints of microalgal derived biodiesel along with its advan- tages and the possible measures to overcome the limitations have been explored. The present article ﬁrstly deals with various aspects of microalgal and plant oil like their pros and cons characteristics as feedstock oil extraction and conversion technol- ogies and the effect on biodiesel properties as well as its emis- sions. The following sections elaborate the sustainable and emerging cost effective technologies in the biodiesel ﬁeld. The ﬁnal section discusses energy return and greenhouse gas emis- sions from biodiesel as well as plant oils and microalgal oils a complementary to each other. 2. Microalgal and plant oil for synthesis of biodiesel A constant supply of the feedstock is a major challenge for the commercialization of biodiesel. The feedstock is also a major contributor towards the total production cost of biodiesel. The overall cost of the feedstock may vary depending on the avail- ability and alternative uses. Ahmad et al. 21 estimated the contribution of feedstock in production cost of biodiesel to be 75 . Demirbas 22 reported the feedstock to contribute 80 of the total production cost whereas Baroi et al. 23 reported the contribution of feedstock to be 88 of the total production cost of biodiesel. Thus feedstock selection and strategies to utilize a low cost feedstock production may be a step towards the econom- ical production of biodiesel. Biodiesel feedstocks are categorized as ﬁrst second and third generation. The ﬁrst generation feedstocks comprise of edible plant oils. The second-generation feedstocks include non-edible plant oils and waste cooking frying oil. The oil derived from algae and other microorganisms are considered to be third generation feedstocks. The current potential feedstocks for the synthesis of biodiesel include plant and microalgal oils. Among the plants and trees several species bear fruit and seed containing oil and thus have potential to provide feedstocks that can be used for synthesis of biodiesel. The advantage of plant oils is that they are easily available worldwide and have a short carbon cycle period of few years as compared to mineral fuels that take millions of years for their formation 24 . There have been plantations of non-edible plant species on waste lands and marginal land in several countries viz. India. However there is no data on the organic carbon the plant based feedstock viz. J. curcas takes from the soil. This is not an issue with the algae as they are grown in aquatic environment. The plant feedstocks comprise of triglycerides free fatty acids and other constituents in minor quantities phorbol esters in J. curcas saponins in M. indica cyanolipids in S. triguga and furanoﬂavones furanoﬂavonols chromenoﬂavones ﬂavones and furanodiketones in P. pinnata . The presence of these constituents makes these oils non-edible for human consumption 13 25 . These lipids may be in form of mono- di- or tri-glyceride or free fatty acids and have varying afﬁnity for their conversion to biodiesel 26 . Triglycerides are considered to be the best substrate to produce biodiesel 20 27 . Hence both lipid content and the quality of the lipid are important in selection of a feedstock for the synthesis of biodiesel 28 . The selection of a feedstock for the synthesis of biodiesel determines the number of carbon atoms per molecule and the structure of bond in the molecule. The number and type of bonds present in the carbon chain then determine the fuel properties of biodiesel 5 . Among the plants new species have continuously been explored for their oil yielding efﬁciency and feasibility to convert it to biodiesel. These includes S. triguga kusum Phoenix dactyli- fera date seed Tenebrio molitor yellow mealworm beetle Datura stramonium L. Guizotia abyssinica L. niger oil Terminalia belerica Roxb. Zanthoxylum bungeanum Haematococcus pluvialis B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 218 Xylocarpus moluccensis 29 36 . Table 1 depicts the list of recently explored feedstocks for biodiesel production. Most of these feed- stocks have shown high conversion rate 496.5 thus fulﬁlling the EN 14103 speciﬁcations. These feedstocks are non-edible though many have alternative applications. The plant J. curcas is a potential feedstock for biodiesel because it can grow on marginal soils drought resistant nature and to some extent is pest resistant. J. curcas has a range of characteristics for coping with water stress. The plant combines C3- CAM photosynthesis in succulent stems where water is stored. The leaves of the plant shift from C3- metabolism to CAM for an increased efﬁciency in the use of water 37 . This has led to cultivation of Jatropha in India China South America and Africa 38 . Grass et al. 39 reported that for the cultivation of 1000 kg of Jatropha seeds requires 40 kg nitrogen 16 kg phosphorous and 10 kg potassium to maintain soil fertility. However when subjected to stressed conditions low nutrient and low water conditions the oil yield is considerably reduced. Hence the monoculture of J. curcas has become debatable in recent times. Research into J. curcas as a dedicated oilseed energy crop through modern techniques such as transcriptomics and near infrared spectroscopy for trait identiﬁcation is ongoing 40 . Another group of the feedstock that hold potential is yellow grease. Though not widely explored yellow grease holds signiﬁcant potential towards production as a biodiesel feedstock. The edible plants oils comprise predominantly of triglycerides with trace amounts of free fatty acids FFA whereas the non- edible plant oils contains signiﬁcant amounts of FFA up to 20 in addition to triglycerides. Presence of FFA in oil imparts a high acid value 41 . In general the biodiesel production from reﬁned oils is easier than the unreﬁned oils due to lower FFA content 42 . Reﬁned oils contain an amount of FFA usually o3 whereas used cooking oil and animal fats contain between 2 7 and 5 30 FFA respectively. High acid value feedstocks include jatropha oil 14 rubber oil 17 mahua oil 19 polanga oil 22 and tobacco oil 35 15 . Due to the limited availability of non-edible feedstocks and their alternative applications a diversiﬁcation of the feedstock has been advocated for synthesis of biodiesel by Karmakar et al. 43 . In comparison to plant oils microalgae have even a shorter carbon period of only a few days as they grow very rapidly. The photosynthetic efﬁciency of microalgae exceeds that of the plants thereby making it a better prospect for the production of oil or other constituents. The photosynthetic efﬁciency of microalgae ranges from 3 to 8 as compared to 0.5 for terrestrial plants 44 . Many species of algae are able to convert sunlight nutrients and CO2 into proteins carbohydrates and lipids with high growth rates that double their biomass up to ﬁve times in a day. Microalgae can be harvested daily and serve as a feedstock for biofuels food edible oil nutraceuticals ﬁsh feeds and chemicals 28 . Micro- algae can be used as a source of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel methane ethanol butanol and hydrogen depending on the constituents of the microalgae starch sugar or oil 45 . The lipid portion of microalgae can be diverted for biodiesel produc- tion whereas the sugar comprises primarily of cellulose can be hydrolyzed and fermented to bioethanol 46 . When the micro- algae are subjected to alteration in culture conditions viz. limited supply of nitrogen high salinity high light intensity they start to accumulate lipids in high concentration in their cells. Microalgae are thus considered as a potential feedstock for the synthesis of biodiesel due to their efﬁciency to store high lipid content in their cells 20 . The exact reason for the oil production in microalgae is still not known though a few hypotheses have been suggested by researchers. One of the hypotheses for storage of oil in microalgae is to provide buoyancy and to keep it aﬂoat in water. However when they are depleted of nitrogen and starts accumulating oil some of the species sinks instead to enhanced buoyancy thus Table 1 Novel feedstocks used for biodiesel production.

Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 219 defying the hypothesis. The other hypothesis is that the lipid acts as a reservoir for its long term survival when subjected to poor environmental conditions while the polysaccharides cater the short-term energy needs 47 . The prospects of microalgae in development of biodiesel is not very recent and dates to 1978 when the US Department of Energy started a program named Aquatic Species Program Biodiesel from Algae which focused on the surveying of microalgal species for the identiﬁcation of suitable strains for their culture in outdoor open system 48 . The microalgae can be grown in either open raceway ponds or photobioreactors 49 . As the cost is one of the constraints in the commercialization of microalgae derived biodiesel there is a debate over using the mode of cultivation i.e. either open raceway ponds or photobioreactors. Both the modes of cultivation offer advantages over the other in some way and have limitations too. While raceway ponds are low cost in terms of capital as well as operating costs. The photobioreactor bears a high cost but it can be better controlled due to the close system and offers a higher yield and productivity of microalgae. In a raceway pond the algae water and nutrients circulate around a racetrack shaped pond with paddlewheels and are kept in constant ﬂow. Raceway ponds are shallow to allow a better penetration of sunlight. Water and nutrients are constantly fed in a raceway pond and the mature algae that are suspended in water are removed from the other end 49 . The energy demand and plant complexity is considerably lower in raceway pond as compared to photobioreactors. The commercial raceway ponds are elliptical in shape with depth of 15 30 cm and the culture velocity is maintained at 15 30 cm s 1 50 . However microalgae can grow quickly in bioreactor photo- bioreactor with a high growth rate. Other than freshwater and nutrient media the microalgae can grow in wastewater marine water or in sewage water. In the process of their growth the microalgae also sequester carbon dioxide which makes the overall process a win win situation where a feedstock for renewable fuel is derived and climate change is negated at least to some extent 49 52 . Several species and strains of microalgae have been utilized to produce oil and have shown potential to be utilized for the production of biodiesel. Microalgae can also be grown by heterotrophic mode of cultivation where carbon source is needed for its growth and subsequent lipid accumulation. Researchers have been investigat- ing various carbon sources including that obtained from waste materials obtained from agriculture and food industries in addi- tion to the conventional sources viz. glucose and fructose. The advantage of using algae as feedstocks is that the yield of the biodiesel can be increased from 10 to 100 times as compared to the conventional raw materials. However microalgal species respond differently to environmental stress. Algal species that respond favorably to nutrient stress e.g. Chlorella vulgaris do so at the cost of a lowered growth rate 53 . Thus the selection of the appropriate microalgae species is an important aspect in the production of high amounts of feedstock oil as ﬂuctuations in the culturing conditions may lead to decrease in the biodiesel yield 54 . Some microalgal species also offer a high growth rate and a high lipid accumulation potential under nutrient stressed and optimal abiotic conditions. Table 2 depicts the microalgal feed- stocks with oil content Z50 55 56 . A high lipid content has been obtained from Chlamydomonas pitschmannii 51 Monora- phidium sp. FXY-10 56.8 . Cultivation harvesting and oil extrac- tion poses challenges that have to be overcome for an economical production of microalgal oil for synthesis of biodiesel 57 58 . At present the extensive processing steps involved in cultivation harvesting and oil extraction from microalgae for the synthesis of biodiesel are cost-intensive 59 . Microalgal oil comprises of constituents other than triglycerides and free fatty acids in sub- stantial amounts. These constituents include hydrocarbons ster- ols waxes sterol esters free alcohols pigments phospholipids and glycolipids which are difﬁcult to convert to FAAE. In addition the algal lipid constituent varies according to the processing methods used in algae culture. Beal et al. 26 found that the triglyceride content decreased whereas the other constituents diglycerides and free fatty acids increased during processing of the algal oil. FFA was formed as a result of the breakdown of constituents such as phospholipids which were produced in the extraction process after the removal of lipid phase. The breakdown has been reported to be have occurred either physically or biochemically. While the physical damage has been attributed to processing methods e.g. electro-mechanical pulsing the bio- chemical damage has been attributed to enzymatic lipase activity 26 . Phospholipids and glycolipids present in lipid have been found to act as surfactant and are a major hindrance in deriving biodiesel of high quality 53 . The species of microalgae are numerous with varying lipid accumulating capacity under nutrient limited stressed conditions. Contrary to microalgae plant species do not need stressed conditions for optimal oil productivity and the oil content varies to compara- tively lesser extent. Plant species are also numerous though not all are suitable to be diverted for the synthesis of biodiesel. Azam et al. 61 studied the prospects of 75 plants species and found 26 of them to be suitable as feedstocks for the synthesis of biodiesel on the basis of empirical values of saponiﬁcation number iodine value and cetane number of the FAAE of the oil. Around 300 feedstocks have been identiﬁed for the synthesis of biodiesel which includes edible non-edible used cooking oils and fats 62 . Plant feedstocks along with those derived from waste animal fats and microalgae can amount to enormous feedstocks available for synthesis of biodiesel. However the feasibility of the individual feedstocks depends on their oil constituents and the adherence of the fuel properties to the biodiesel speciﬁcations. High oxidation stability with a low cold ﬁlter plugging point is preferred for a biodiesel fuel. However an inverse relationship between a high oxidative stability imparted with high saturated ester constituent and better cold ﬂow properties imparted with high unsaturated constituents of the biodiesel fuel 15 . Feedstocks with poor cold ﬁlter plugging points but may not be suitable for locations where cold climatic conditions persist. ASTM speciﬁcation for biodiesel states the limit for linolenic acid which is 12 and the fatty acid containing four double bonds should not be more than 1 of the total constituent 61 . A high content of oleic acid C18 1 offers a balance between the fuel properties oxidation stability and cold ﬁlter plugging point of biodiesel and its high Table 2 Microalgal strains with oil content Z50 .

Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 220 content in the microalgal or plant oils are preferable 63 . The presence of saturated fatty acids offers stability to the biodiesel and monounsaturated fatty acids allows for better low temperature properties with lesser compromise on the stability of biodiesel. Hence the presence of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in a feedstock is desirable to obtain a better quality of biodiesel. The corrosion aspects of biodiesel also depend on the feedstocks used for production of biodiesel and a high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids can lead to greater oxidation rate caused by the fuel 64 . Another constituent that depends on the feedstock is acid value AV . A high AV will limit the feasibility of the feedstock for alkaline transesteriﬁcation of the feedstock. The alternative process for synthesis of biodiesel possessing a high acid value will be acid esteriﬁcation which usually takes a longer time. Acid esteriﬁcation followed by alkaline transesteriﬁcation may also be adopted 15 65 . 2.1. Lipid content and characteristics of microalgae and plant oil The lipid content in plant and microalgal oils is of particular interest for their utilization in synthesis of biodiesel. The lipid constituent plays a vital role in the properties of biodiesel. The major constituent present in the plant oil is triacylglycerols commonly called triglycerides that is synthesized by esteriﬁcation of glycerol with fatty acids in the presence of enzymes as catalyst. The plant oil is the major source of triglyceride in human diet 66 . Plant oils comprise of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The major constituents in the non-edible oils are similar to the edible oils. Soybean oil which is the most common edible oil and constitutes 60 of world s vegetable oil market is composed of ﬁve fatty acids palmitic acid stearic acid oleic acid linoleic acid and linolenic acid. The fatty acid proﬁle of Sunﬂower oil from the Brand Famila also showed these ﬁve fatty acids as major con- stituents and other fatty acids in minor amount. Other edible oils rapeseed safﬂower also have a similar constituent of fatty acids with minor differences in their composition. The fatty acid con- stituent in Millettia pinnata oil was similar to that of the edible oil e.g. soybean and sunﬂower . The main difference observed in the composition of non-edible oils M. pinnata and Madhuca longifolia with edible oils is the presence of a monounsaturated fatty acid i.e. oleic acid as a major constituent 65.8 and 46.3 in the former in comparison to 24.5 and 34.3 in soybean and sunﬂower oil respectively. The linoleic acid composition was much less 12.1 and 17.9 in M. pinnata and M. longifolia as compared to 53.0 and 51.17 in soybean and sunﬂower oil respectively. Table 3 depicts the fatty acid composition of edible and non-edible plant oils 67 70 . However apart from the triglycerides the non-edible oils also contains signiﬁcant amount of free fatty acids 15 . The non- edible oils also comprise of toxic constituents which limits their application. One of the widely used feedstock of synthesis of biodiesel J. curcas contains phorbol esters. Hence though J. curcas has protein content similar to soybean oil it cannot be consumed for edible purpose and ﬁnds application in soil amendment and as feedstock for biofuel 71 72 . Similarly M. pinnata erstwhile P. pinnata possesses furanoﬂavones furanoﬂavonols chromeno- ﬂavones ﬂavones and furanodiketones apart from triglycerides that makes the oil non-edible 73 . The toxic constituent in M. longifolia erstwhile M. longifolia is bitter saponins. S. triguga oil recently utilized for synthesis of biodiesel contains hydrogen cyanide in the concentration of 0.03 0.05 which hinders in either its saponiﬁcation or transesteriﬁcation. To make the oil saponiﬁ- able the cyano-glucosides is hydrolyzed under pressure using zinc oxide and sodium bisulphate which is followed by settling and removal of aqueous layer 29 . Azam et al. 61 studied the lipid proﬁle of 75 plant species found in India comprising lipid content more than 30 in their seed or kernel. The saponiﬁcation number of the plants varied from 169.2 to 312.5. Whereas the iodine value which the measures the level of unsaturation varied from 4.8 to 212. Based on the lipid proﬁle of the plants its SV IV and cetane number CN Azam et al. 61 repotted 26 plants to be suitable for synthesis of biodiesel among the selected plant species. These species possessed SV ranging from 193 to 205.2 IV ranging from 49.9 to 98.4 CN ranging from 51.09 to 61.55. The minimum value of CN possessed by biodiesel has been speciﬁed by USA ASTM D 6751 Germany DIN 15606 and European Standard EN 14214 to be 47 49 and 51 respectively. A high composition of saturated fatty acids in oil will give a high value of CN. IV has a profound effect on the fuel properties of biodiesel as presence of unsatu- rated components prevents biodiesel against solidiﬁcation. How- ever a large degree of unsaturation leads to polymerization of biodiesel upon reaction with atmospheric air. A maximum limit of 115 has been speciﬁed by EN 14214 for IV. Also there exists an inverse relation between CN and IV. Though a high value of CN is desired in a fuel a very high value will lead to solidiﬁcation of biodiesel and hence an upper limit of 65 for CN has been speciﬁed in US biodiesel speciﬁcation Azam et al. 61 . The lipid constituents of plant and microalgal oils are quite different. The lipid content in plant oil that has shown potential and has been utilized for synthesis of biodiesel varies from 33 P. pinnata to as high as 73 . Canarium commune . However the commonly used plant feedstocks J. curcas M. indica and Schleichera oleosa have oil content of 40 15 . The composition of triglycerides present in the plant based feedstock oils varies from saturated and monounsaturated to polyunsaturated fatty acids. However the microalgal oil in addition to triglycerides may also contain substances such as hydrocarbon alcohol and wax which cannot undergo either esteriﬁcation or transesteriﬁcation and hence have to be separated or otherwise they will remain in the ﬁnal product. Microalgal oils may also contain alkane like hydrocarbons which have a high caloriﬁc value and low viscosity. Microalgae are known to produce neutral lipids comprising mainly of triacyl- glycerols when they are subjected to environmental stress. Complete nutrient stress results in a higher accumulation of neutral lipids as compared to selective nutrient stress 74 . The synthesis of neutral lipids has been suggested to be protective mechanism for the cells to adapt under stressful conditions 75 . The lipid constituent in the microalgal oil is made up of saponiﬁ- able as well as non-saponiﬁable matter. The neutral lipids com- prises of the saponiﬁable matter viz. triglycerides and free fatty acids. The total lipid constitutes of neutral lipids pigments phospholipids and glycolipids 48 . Despite neutral and polar Table 3 Fatty acid composition edible and non-edible of plant oils.

Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 221 lipids being able to be converted to biodiesel neutral lipids are considered to be the best substrate for production of FAAE as they can be easily transesteriﬁed 76 . The focus in recent times has been a high lipid accumulation in the cells of microalgae species. Various studies have been done by researchers to explore the species with a high oil lipid accumulating potential. However the lipid content varies signiﬁcantly among the microalgae species. The theoretical values of microalgal oil that can be extracted from microalgae have been reported to be high. However not all species have shown a high amount for the fatty acid accumulation and biomass productivity. The oil content is found to be highest in Botryococcus braunii 25 to 75 but its productivity is poor. The commonly grown microalgae species of Chlorella Dunaliella Isochrysis Nannochloris Nanno-chloropsis Neochloris Nitzschia Phaeodactylum and Porphyridium have oil content in the range 20 50 77 . Abou-Shanab et al. 78 isolated 45 microalgae from a freshwater lake and on the basis of their morphology studied the lipid accumulating potential of ﬁve species amongst them. The lipid content potential varied signiﬁcantly for the selected species and possessed a comparatively low content of 26 of dry weight for C. vulgaris and a high content of 51 of dry weight for C. pitschmannii. Though a considerable yield of total lipid was observed from the three microalgae C. vulgaris Neochloris oleoa- bundans and Cylindrotheca closterium taking in account the dry weight of the biomass viz. ranging from 17 to 23 the lipid content comprising of triacylglycerols was less and varied from 9 to 14 of dry weight for the three microalgae with the highest value in the range 11 14 of dry weight was obtained in case of C. vulgaris 27 . Some species have shown a high triglyceride accu- mulation efﬁcient in their lipid proﬁle. Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella zoﬁngiensis microalgal species have shown accumulation of 35 triglycerides of their dry weight. A high triglyceride productivity of 322 and 243 mg L 1 d 1 has been observed 28 . Kaiwan-arporn et al. 79 reported that the cyanobacteria Syne- chocystis aquatilis comprised mainly of polyunsaturated fatty acids primarily linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid . Chinnasamy et al. 80 demonstrated that only about 63.9 of the algal oil extracted could be converted to biodiesel. The ﬁnal recovery of the FAAE further reduced to 38.7 due to loss during base transesteriﬁcation and puriﬁcation of the product. There exists a trade-off between the productivity of microalgae and its lipid accumulating capacity 21 . Thus when environmental conditions are controlled for high lipid accumulation the microalgae divert energy to form lipids thus compromising with its productivity. Similarly high biomass productivity in microalgae is achieved when not subjected to stress for high lipid accumulation 21 . Hence a balance between the lipid production and biomass growth in microalgae has to be maintained for on optimum production of oil. The chain length of the fatty acid present in the feedstock inﬂuences the viscosity of the biodiesel. A longer chain length of the fatty acid causes a high viscosity 81 . Presence of high content of saturated fatty acid also contributes to a high viscosity. Winterization can be done to reduce the content of saturated fatty acids from oil. The technique can be used to ozonize the oil which results in a smaller size of crystals formed at low temperature. Alternatively biodiesel can be cooled and the crystals can be removed by ﬁltration 9 . Ker- schbaum et al. 9 have proposed winterization of oil biodiesel from waste cooking oil by using micro heat exchangers which resulted in reduction of saturated fatty acid methyl esters from 21.3 to 9.6 which led to lowering of the cold ﬁlter plugging point by 11 1C. Another limiting factor for the usage of microalgal oil as feedstock for synthesis of biodiesel is the presence of phospholipids which interfere with lipase used to catalyze the reaction and substrate 58 . A few microalgal species Chaetoceros gracilis and Tetraselmis tetrathele have been found to grow in saline water and produce high levels of lipids. These microalgae respond to sodium hydroxide thus could be harvested using ﬂocculation. B. braunii has been found to grow in saline waters contains a high level of hydrocarbons up to 80 of the dry biomass 82 . The method utilized a silica cartridge for the fractionation of the total lipids to neutral lipids glycolipids and phospholipids. Different solvent mixtures with varying ratios were used for their elution. After conditioning the adsorbent with chloroform the neutral lipid glycolipid and phospholipid were eluted from the adsorbent bed with chloroform acetic acid 9 1 v v mixture acetone methanol 9 1 v v mixture and methanol respectively. The fractions were then collected in conical vials and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen 20 . The same method was adopted by Damiani et al. 83 for the fractionation of lipid neutral glycolipid and phospholipid of H. pluvialis. Voorenet al. 54 has reported high oil content from Nannochloropsis oculata amounting to 50 and 43 dry weight of fatty acid and pure triacylglycerol respectively. A high lipid productivity of 3.6 10 3 kg of triacylgly- cerol m 2 d 1 has been reported. Voorenet al. 54 reported that the nitrogen starvation to enhance the lipid productivity results in simultaneous decrease in growth kinetics. Therefore in addition to nitrogen starvation the amount of light received per cell should be high for high triglyceride accumulation in microalgal oil. The light received per cell is dependent on the incident photons ﬂux density biomass optical properties and concentration geometry of photo- bioreactor depth of the culture being the prominent . Marine microalgae provide an opportunity for low cost micro- algae cultivation in the natural environment. Doan et al. 76 studied 96 strains of marine microalgae isolated from the coastal waters of Singapore that possessed a high biomass productivity and intracel- lular lipid content for utilization as feedstock for biodiesel. Among these 96 microalgal strains 26 were characterized on the basis of high growth rate 0.41 0.95 d 1 biomass concentration 0.047 0.01 0.3970.09 g L 1 and lipid content 0.970.1 44.871.7 g 1 DCW lipid content. Among the species Skeletonema costatum Chaetoceros sp. and Thalassiosira sp. showed comparatively high growth rate of 0.95 0.87 and 0.61 0.85 d 1. However in terms of lipid yield strains of Nannochloropsis sp. were found to be highest with the lipid content up to 45 g 1 DCW. Owing to their high biomass productivity and high intracellular lipid content they have been projected to be a prominent feedstock for biodiesel production. However when the transesteriﬁcation of the oil derived for Nanno- chloropsis species were carried out the yield reported 25 51 was much lower than that speciﬁed by the EN norms 96.5 76 . Vijayaraghavan and Hemanathan 84 reported the production of biodiesel from freshwater microalgal oil. The lipid content of the microalgae was reported to be 4574 . Knothe and Kenar 85 based on the physico-chemical properties debated that the pro- ducts obtained from microalgal species utilized by Vijayaraghavan and Hemanathan 84 were hydrocarbons. The density of the product obtained by Vijayaraghavan and Hemanathan 84 was 0.801 kg m 3 whereas the density of biodiesel is in the range of 0.86 0.89 kg m 3. The ﬂash point of the biodiesel was also low 98 1C as compared to the minimum 130 1C speciﬁed for biodiesel. This necessitates the proper identiﬁcation of the alkyl esters and other constituents in biodiesel derived from microalgal oil. The choice of feedstock is governed by the available factors that include the agriculture sociology geopolitics and economy of a nation. Table 4 depicts the lipid proﬁles of some of the microalgal species. It is observed that the lipid constituent is dominated by unsaturated fatty acids 63 80 86 87 . 2.2. Lipid extraction from microalgae and plant Plant or microalgal oil after selection can be used for the synthesis of either of the bio-fuel i.e. biodiesel bio-oil or biochar 88 . Of these products biodiesel offers a high caloriﬁc value and is preferred for B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 222 synthesis. However based on the feasibility and requirement of the end products either of these products may be synthesized. While esteriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation are utilized for synthesis of biodiesel pyrolysis is the process adopted for the production of bio-oil or biochar 49 . For the production of either of these utility products the process for extraction of oil is lengthy which starts with choosing an ideal feedstock that could be cultivated and harvested with a high biomass dry productivity and possessing a high oil lipid of triglycerides and free fatty acids content. Plant oils that are derived from either seed or kernels constitute a known percentage of oil varying from 30 to 35 61 . Extraction of the oils from plants is simple usually by a mechanical expeller followed by soxhlet extraction method using a solvent. Extraction of microalgal oil involves numerous lengthy processes. The steps involved in harvesting and expulsion of microalgal oil can include sedimentation centrifugation ﬁltration ultra-ﬁltration additional ﬂocculation to remove algae from water drying and solvent extrac- tion 2 . Drying of biomass and extraction of oil from the cultured microalgae could account for 80 of the total energy consumption 50 . The harvesting can be done by several techniques namely centrifugation ﬂocculation ﬁltration and screening gravity sedimen- tation ﬂotation or through electrophoresis. The mode of dewatering differs among the microalgal species and depends upon the micro- algal properties like cell size culture density. Centrifugation though found effective bares a high operating cost. Flocculation gravity sedimentation has been found to concentrate microalgae culture. Hence a combination of centrifugation with other techniques ﬂota- tion or gravity sedimentation for an efﬁcient dewatering may prove more economical. Filtration of microalgae utilizes membranes through which the microalgae suspension is passed. The challenge with the technique is that speciﬁc pore size of the screens should be tailor-made for the speciﬁc species of microalgae. High concentra- tions of microalgae cause blockages of the screen whereas low concentrations of microalgae result in inefﬁcient capture. Gravity sedimentation offers a cheap technique whereby natural sedimenta- tion of the microalgae occurs through lamella separators and sedimentation tanks. The orientation of plates in lamella separators offer increased settling areas 30 . After harvesting biomass is dried using various methods like solar drying oven drying and freeze drying. Of these techniques although solar drying is the most time consuming but it is most energy efﬁcient technique. Dried biomass is subjected to solvent extraction. Disruption of cell wall using micro- wave sonication and osmotic shock facilitates the lipid extraction. 3. Conversion of microalgae and plant oil to biodiesel 3.1. Catalysts for esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation 3.1.1. Chemical catalysts for esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation The catalyst plays an important role in the esteriﬁcation or transesteriﬁcation of lipid oil obtained from plants and microalgae. Catalysts that have been used for esteriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation of plant oils include heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical catalysts 89 92 . The mechanism of esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation from the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are similar. Homogeneous base catalysis for transesteriﬁcation is a three step process which starts with the formation of alkoxide from the alcohol. The nucleophilic alkoxide attacks the carbonyl carbon group in the triglyceride to form a tetrahedral intermediate. The intermediate reacts with an alcohol to regenerate the alkoxide in the second step. The rearrangement of the intermediates leads to formation of diglycerides and FAAE. In the last two steps two molecules of FAAE are formed when diglyceride and monoglyceride are converted to monoglyceride and glycerol respectively. In acid catalysis the carbonyl group of the triglyceride gets protonated which leads to carbocation. The protonated carbon is attacked by an alcohol that results in formation of an intermediate. In the next step the intermediate eliminates glycerol that results in formation of an ester while the catalyst is regenerated 17 93 . In the heterogeneous Lewis basic catalyzed reaction CaO and MgO formation of the alkoxide group is pertinent. In general the Brönsted acid group of catalysts is found to be active mainly in esteriﬁcation reactions and Lewis acid catalysts are more active in transesteriﬁcation reactions 92 . A high biodiesel yield with feedstocks of acid value o4.0 mg KOH g 1 amount to almost complete conversion 100 has been reported by the researchers using homogeneous base catalysts. The biodiesel yields with heterogeneous base catalysts are also high amounting to 498 although the reaction rate is comparatively slow compared to those catalyzed with homogeneous catalysts. The reason is due to three phase system in the heterogeneous catalyzed reaction which causes a mass transfer limitation during reaction. In the heteroge- neous catalyzed reaction the adsorption of reactants oil and alcohol and desorption of products FAAE biodiesel di- mono-glyceride and glycerol should occur on the surface of the solid acid or base catalyst at a considerable rate 93 . The advantage using the hetero- geneous catalyst is its easy separation from the products and production of glycerol of high purity 98 as compared to that with homogeneous derived catalyst 80 42 . Though homogeneous catalysts are few there is a vast range of the solid heterogeneous catalysts that have been explored to catalyze the transesteriﬁcation reaction. Common homogeneous base catalysts used in transesteriﬁcation include sodium hydro- xide potassium hydroxide and sodium methoxide. Sulphuric acid is utilized as homogeneous acid catalyst for esteriﬁcation. The application in the homogeneous acid and base catalysts in biofuel industry have numerous disadvantages e.g. corrosion of the reactors storage tanks and engines 94 . In addition their removal from the biofuels through aqueous quenching results in the forma- tion of stable emulsions and soap and are energy intensive 2 . The heterogeneous catalysts utilized in synthesis of biodiesel are grouped as solid acid and solid base catalyst. Solid acid catalyst includes a wide range of chemicals viz. resins tungstated and sulfated zirconia polyaniline sulphate heteropolyacid metal complexes sulfated tin Table 4 Fatty acid proﬁle of some microalgal strains studied for biodiesel production.

Solid base catalysts also include a wide range of catalysts viz. calcium oxide hydrotalcite also called layered double hydroxide alumina and zeolites 89 . One of the major issues with the use of homogeneous and heterogenous catalysts is its removal from the product. Removal of leached constituents of heterogeneous catalysts is a major issue in synthesis of biodiesel. While a large number of heterogeneous catalysts have been utilized for the synthesis of biodiesel from the plant based oil the activity of several these catalysts on the microalgal based oil is yet to be tested 90 . Conventional catalysts were designed on the basis of feedstocks that were reﬁned and constituted of minimal impurities. In recent times the non-food based feedstocks have been extensively used in the production of biodiesel which pose new challenges for a high catalytic activity for esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation. These challenges include water tolerance pore size and dimensionality of the channel system for the solid catalyst for its application in the esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation reaction 2 . The plant oil has shown a high yield and conversion when catalyzed with homo- geneous catalyst in a short time around 1 h . With heterogeneous catalysts a high yield and conversion of plant derived oil to biodiesel has been obtained though with comparatively longer time. 3.1.2. Biocatalyst for esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation Enzyme lipases are employed as catalyst for biodiesel synthesis. Enzyme catalysts can be effectively used for low quality feedstock with high free fatty acid content. Lipases catalyze both esteriﬁca- tion as well as transesteriﬁcation. Quality and yield of product is high. Enzymes have shown a good catalytic efﬁciency in the conversion of oil to biodiesel with purity ranging from 90 to 96 . A high purity has been attributed to the polishing cycles where the contaminant s also get converted to biodiesel. However the enzymatic mode of catalysts suffers from constraints. Besides it being costly water is usually required to enhance the activity of enzyme that in turn causes accumulation of fatty acids in biodie- sel. This requires polishing steps by additional treatment of the remaining fatty acids with the enzyme. If fatty acid concentration is 41 the shift in reaction equilibrium requires a high alcohol concentration thus causing irreversible damage to the enzyme 95 . There is immense scope for usage of enzymes as catalyst in the synthesis of biodiesel from plant or microalgae derived oil. The enzymes have constrains in the current scenario in its application as catalyst for synthesis of biodiesel. However there are possibi- lities of improvement in the process where enzymatic methods can be adopted at relatively low temperatures and atmospheric pressure which will lead to reduction in consumption of energy. Enzymes pose a high selectivity and speciﬁcation and can lead to a high conversion of oil to biodiesel resulting in a high quality product. When an enzyme particularly lipase is being used as a catalyst methanol has to be added in stepwise to avoid the lipase deactivation. In the process one molar equivalent of methanol with respect to the oil is added at a time and the process is repeated thrice. There have been limited studies on the conversion of microalgal oil to biodiesel either chemically or enzymatically 96 . Hama and Kondo 57 states that the present price of enzymes is higher than its alkali counterpart. The enzymes are also prone to inactivation which may limit its applicability to industrial scale production 97 . To tackle these constraints researchers are looking for possible solutions. Use of immobilized enzymes provides advantage of its easy separation and reusability. Immobilization also provides stability to the enzyme. The advantage with the process is that the lipase Candida antarctica can be reused for more than 50 cycles. Immobilized enzyme can be used in continuous reactors which are easy to scale up to industrial scale. Lipases from different sources has varying speciﬁcity and stability thus new approaches to using lipase mixtures are being employed to achieve high yields and better performance. A whole cell catalyst compris- ing of two lipases C. antarctica B Novozyme 435 and Thermo- myces lanuginosus Lipozyme were co-expressed on the surface of Pichia pastoris cell through self-immobilization that avoids the procedures of complex immobilization. A high biodiesel conver- sion ca. 95.4 was observed in the ﬁrst run of the experiment at a moderate temperature 40 1C in 12 h at the stirring rate of 200 rpm. However the activity of the catalyst decreased to 90 in the second run and further in the subsequent runs. Hence for the ability to reuse the catalysts further improvements are required 97 . In future with advances in enzyme catalysts for biodiesel production it has potential to provide greener and sustainable conversion strategy for biodiesel production. Tables 5 and 6 describe various catalysts used for the conversion of different plant and microalgal oil respectively 25 93 98 111 3.2. Reaction kinetics in the synthesis of biodiesel The kinetics is an important parameter to be studied in the production of biodiesel as it depicts the activation energy of the reaction and the time involved for the completion of the reaction. The esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation of the fatty acids present in the oil fat reacts at a moderate rate. Based on the rate constants the conversion of triglyceride to diglyceride has been found to be the slowest reaction in transesteriﬁcation 112 . In the presence of excess alcohol the kinetics of the transesteriﬁcation is pseudo-ﬁrst order for forward reaction and second order for the backward reaction 17 . As the reaction is mass transfer controlled due to the low miscibility of the two reactants a subsequent low initial reaction rate is observed. However the mass transfer limitation is over- come by mechanical means of agitation. The formation of methyl esters results in the formation of single phase of reactants by acting as a mutual solvent and increased the equilibrium concen- tration of triglycerides in methanol. The production of methyl esters increases the overall rate of mass transfer of the reactants. Hence the production of methyl esters increases the solubility of triglycerides in methanol as well as mass transfer coefﬁcient. It has been found that the intrinsic reaction rate during the transester- iﬁcation reaction is not fast enough to consume all the triglycer- ides as they react with alcohol thus accumulating the reactants in the reaction vessel taking considerable time for reaction to complete. The catalyst concentration directly affect the reaction rate whereas the agitation speed directly affects the mass transfer rate. Agitation enhances the contact between the two phases of the reactants thus increasing the surface area. Thus a high concentration of triglycerides in the methanol phase is an indica- tion high reaction rate. Csernica et al. 113 states that the transesteriﬁcation reaction gets accelerated under mass transfer control as well as reaction control. It is predicted that the acceleration in the transesteriﬁcation reaction is not necessarily caused by the change in the rate limiting step but from the phase transition from two phases to a single phase. The consumption of antioxidants in FFA based biodiesel has been found to follow the ﬁrst order reaction kinetics 114 . During the overall reaction the ﬁrst step that involves the conversion of triglycerides to diglycer- ides was observed to be the rate determining step in the produc- tion of biodiesel. The reaction rate constant for the ﬁrst step of conversion triglyceride to diglycerides was 0.0311 which was signiﬁcantly lower than the second diglycerides to monoglycer- ide and third step monoglycerides to triacetylglycerol of reac- tion with values of 0.1124 and 0.1129 respectively 115 . B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 224 In general the determination of kinetics requires collection of numerous samples. This has been done by gas chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. However these processes are relatively lengthy as they require the derivatization of the sample. Hence alternative methods have been adopted by researchers for fast determination of the reaction kinetics. Birla et al. 116 used the nuclear magnetic resonance as a rapid method in the characteriza- tion of fatty acid alkyl ester content in biodiesel. The ﬁrst order kinetics of the reaction was established with activation energy of 79 kJ mol 1 and frequency factor of 2.98 1010 min 1 utilizing waste frying oil and snail shell derived CaO as catalyst. Vujicic et al. 117 reported the transesteriﬁcation is actually a fourth order reaction with the assumption that three moles of alcohol reacts initially with one mole of triglyceride. But as an excess amount of alcohol is usually employed in the transesteriﬁcation the reaction is assumed to be follow pseudo ﬁrst order kinetics. In the transester- iﬁcation of sunﬂower oil using CaO as heterogeneous catalyst a negative inﬂuence of the reaction time on the yield of biodiesel was observed. A drop of activation energy from 162.1 to 101.0 kJ mol 1 was observed when the reaction time was increased from 1.5 to 5.5 h. The reaction rate constant was studied at various temperatures and found to be highest during 5th 21.74 10 3 min 1 and 2nd h 109.67 10 3 min 1 at 60 and 80 1C respectively. The highest reaction rate of 175.40 10 3 and 220.86 10 3 min 1 was obtained at 1st h when run at 100 and 120 1C respectively. The ﬁrst-order kinetics was also proposed by Zhang et al. 118 for the transesteriﬁcation of palm oil with dimethyl carbonate using KOH as homogeneous catalyst. A good linearity between ln k and 1 T was observed in the temperature range of 65 70 and 75 1C which validated the pseudo ﬁrst order hypothesis of the reaction. Santos et al. 119 calculated the activation energy Ea for the volatilization of sunﬂower oil and biodiesel derived from sunﬂower oil. The Ea was obtained as a function of the conversion for the volatilization process and was in the range of ca. 50 75 kJ mol 1 for biodiesel derived from sunﬂower oil and ca. 170 210 kJ mol 1 for the sunﬂower oil. Table 7 shows reaction kinetics in the production of biodiesel 116 117 120 122 . The high Ea for the thermal volatilization of sunﬂower oil has been advocated for its feasibility as a potential feedstock bearing a high stability. As the collection of numerous samples conversion of oil to biodiesel at subsequent time interval is needed for the study of kinetics and the conventional mode of analysis by gas chromatorgaphy high performance liquid Table 5 Conversion of various plant oils to biodiesel.

Fedosov et al. 95 utilized a dye Nile Red for monitoring the progress of esteriﬁcation reaction of oleic acid using ﬂuorescent probe. Nile Red being soluble in organic liquids changes its quantum yield forming hydrogen bonding with organic molecule in the presence of hydrophilic group and causes a red shift of its emission spectrum. In the esteriﬁcation reaction the substrates oleic acid and organic alcohol have hydrophilic group which on reaction forms two products hydrophobic molecule and water . While water gets separated from the oil phase the hydrophobic molecule is neutral towards ﬂuorophore. Thus there is disappearance of red shift emission spectrum with the progress of reaction. 3.3. Reﬁning techniques for crude biodiesel Biodiesel should be of high quality which is indicative through its FAAE content w w and thus adherence to the speciﬁcations. The purity of the biodiesel is dependent on several factors viz. fatty acid composition of the feedstock presence of constituents other than fatty acids in the oil production process adopted for its synthesis and the reﬁning methods adopted for the crude biodiesel 120 . The crude biodiesel contains impurities i.e. products other than fatty acid alkyl ester that include soap formed due to saponiﬁcation if an alkali is used as a catalyst tri-di-and mono-glyceride due to un-complete reaction alcohol unreacted and glycerol un-removed during separation with FAAE . Some other constituents may also be present in minor quantity in the oil if already present in the feedstock viz. saponins in M. indica oil 14 . These minor constituents may comprise of toxic components present in many non-edible feedstocks. The reﬁning technologies for biodiesel derived from non-microalgal based feedstocks are well documented in literature. One of the most common techniques widely adopted include an easy method such as washing of the crude biodiesel for removal of residual catalyst glycerol alcohol and tri- di- mono-glycerides and subsequent removal of water either by an anhydrous compound viz. sodium sulfate or through rotary evaporator 123 . Karaosmanog lu et al. 124 reported washing of the crude biodiesel by hot distilled water 50 1C to obtain biodiesel of high purity 99 w w FAAE and a high reﬁning yield 86.3 . The water washing steps may be curtailed to some extent by utilizing heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of biodiesel where the solid catalyst can be separated by ﬁltration and alcohol can be removed by rotary evaporator. An acid is usually used ortho-phosphoric acid to neutralize the alkali used as catalyst in the transesteriﬁcation so that less water is needed for removal of the residual catalyst and emulsion formation is reduced. The alcohol is removed prior to wet washing to prevent its entrance in the waste- water and to allow reuse 125 . Despite the effectiveness of water washing for the removal of contaminants it is an energy intensive process and causes loss of FAAE and whilst generating wastewater 123 125 . Researchers have explored methods to curtail the energy consumption while reﬁning the crude biodiesel so that it fulﬁlls the international speciﬁcations ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 . Atadashi et al. 123 discussed various reﬁning technologies for the puriﬁcation of crude biodiesel and reported membrane reﬁning process to be less energy consuming and generating minimal wastewater. The technologies that have been described for reﬁning of crude biodiesel are wet washing dry washing and through membrane reﬁning. Wet washing of crude biodiesel by water was efﬁcient in the removal of methanol and free glycerol and meeting EN 14214 speciﬁcations. The dry washing process utilized either magnesol or ion exchange resins were inefﬁcient in the removal of methanol. Using the membrane technology the removal of the constituents other than FAAE triglycerides residual glycerol has been advocated as an efﬁcient method for puriﬁcation of biodiesel. The use of enzymatic catalysts simpliﬁes the reﬁning of the product though it has the disadvantage of slower conversion of triglycerides to FAAE. The separation and puriﬁcation of biodiesel has been found to be simpler with reﬁned vegetable oil due to less content of fatty acids and water than in unreﬁned vegetable oils 120 . Though the separation process adopted for the removal of biodiesel from glycerol by washing with water is efﬁcient the equilibrium solubility of water in esters is higher than that speciﬁed for water in pure biodiesel. Hence an additional step is incorporated that demands the removal of water from biodiesel by either vacuum driers or passing it through anhydrous sodium sulfate 126 127 . Another disadvantage of using water as a medium for puriﬁcation of esters is the loss of ester content as it gets washed away with the waste water. The separation of glycerol from biodiesel is necessary for the biodiesel fuel to comply with the international speciﬁcations that restricts the maximum limit to 0.02 . Gomes et al. 126 used microﬁltration with ceramic membrane to separate biodiesel from glycerol. The ceramic membranes with pore diameter of 0.2 0.4 and 0.8 mm were found to efﬁciently separate biodiesel from glycerol. When transmembrane pressure of 2.0 bar was applied with a 0.2 mm membrane the glycerol was found to remain on the membrane with an efﬁciency of 99.4 . Ren et al. 127 demonstrated a ﬁxed bed reactor packed with anion exchange resin as a heterogeneous catalyst in a continuous process for the synthesis of biodiesel and found complete separation of glycerol due to its adsorption on the resin. When microalgae are used as feedstock constituents other than triglycerides and free fatty acids are also present whose removal may or may not be necessary. The biodiesel is usually washed till the pH is neutral. Falahati and Tremblay 12 utilized various feedstocks canola sunﬂower and corn for the synthesis of biodiesel. The water and FAAE ratio of 1 4 was adopted for washing of crude biodiesel from edible oil only once which was followed by either dry washing or cold ﬁltration to remove monoglycerides. The diglycerides and triglycerides are not removed by water washing. Glycerol concentra- tion after the water washing of FAAE was within the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 speciﬁcations. It was found that the biodiesel synthe- sized by membrane reactor required less water washing due to particulate free nature of the permeate. 4. Properties of biodiesel synthesized from microalgae and plant oil 4.1. Effect of feedstocks on fuel properties and exhaust emissions in a CI engine It is widely accepted that the long term exposure to particulate matter causes adverse health effects leading to lung cancer and Table 7 Kinetics studies in transesteriﬁcation reaction.

Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 226 cardiopulmonary mortality 128 . Hence the reduction in the exhaust emissions from the combustion of biodiesel is an impor- tant aspect for the advocacy of its usage in CI engines. The fatty acids present in plant oils differ from that of microalgal oils. While the plant oil comprises of a mixture of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids the microalgae comprises mainly of unsaturated fatty acids that comprise of four or more double bonds 129 . The presence of high a constituent of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the feedstock can lead to a lower stability of biodiesel 130 . Linolenic acid that contains three double bonds should not be present in excess of 12 and the double bond should not be excess of 1 as per the speciﬁcation for biodiesel. A high level of unsaturation for biodiesel will result in oxidation of the fuel and will render it off- speciﬁcation. The fatty acid chains in the lipids present in micro- algae can range from C11 to C26 though the common chain length usually observed is C14 to C22.The fatty acid constituent may be saturated or unsaturated with up to six double bonds 82 . In early work carried out by Azam et al. 61 the fatty acid proﬁles of 75 plant species with oil content 430 were examined. Based on the fatty acid content only 26 species showed potential for their application as feedstocks for the synthesis of biodiesel. The parameters that were taken in consideration were saponiﬁcation value iodine value and cetane number that were determined empirically. The fatty acid composition of the feedstock along with FFA content moisture impurities and unsaponiﬁable constituents have a profound effect on some of the physico-chemical properties of biodiesel. These include density acid value viscosity ﬂash point cetane number oxidation stability and cold ﬂow properties. The cetane number of the biodiesel increases with increasing chain length of the fatty acids and increasing saturation. The presence of high content of unsaturated components C18 2 and C18 3 results in a low cetane number of biodiesel. The cold ﬁlter plugging point CFPP indicates the cold ﬂow property of biodiesel has a lower value for the feedstock comprising of unsaturated fatty acids. A low CFPP is preferable as the fuel biodiesel will gets solidiﬁed at a lower temperature 129 . Tang et al. 131 studied the biodiesel obtained from soybean cottonseed and poultry fat stored at 4 1C and observed that the precipitates were formed the extent of which depended on the feedstock and blend concentra- tion. The cottonseed feedstock comprised of high composition of saturated fatty acids 28.2 as compared to soybean oil 19.2 . In biodiesel derived from soybean oil the precipitates were formed due to steryl glucosides. The formation of precipitates in the cottonseed oil derived biodiesel was attributed to both steryl glucosides and monoglycerides along with other minor compo- nents. Halim et al. 86 proposed the marine Chlorococcum sp.despite the low lipid content 7.1 wt to be suitable for the production of biodiesel on the basis of the lipid constituents fatty acids present in the feedstock. The oleic acid C 18 1 a mono- unsaturated fatty acids was predominant in the feedstock that comprised of around 63 wt followed by palmitic acid C 16 0 comprising of 19 wt and other constituents in minor amount. The feedstock comprising of both monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids in a balanced proportion can be a good feedstock for biodiesel as it will best compromise between low temperature properties and oxidation stability of biodiesel. The feedstock has been found to inﬂuence the exhaust parti- culate emissions from compression ignition engines. In most of the studies done so far the exhaust emissions from biodiesel and biodiesel blends have shown reduction in CO hydrocarbons HC and particulate matter emissions and enhancement in NOx emis- sions. Biodiesel reduces soot emissions but increases soluble organic fraction of the particulate matter which has been attrib- uted to its distillation characteristics and high viscosity 132 . Usually the emission from the biodiesel is low as compared to that from mineral diesel except NOx 15 . NOx emissions is usually found to be more in biodiesel than from mineral diesel 134 . A higher emission of NOx can pose a major disadvantage for the application of biodiesel as alternative fuel as NOx leads to ozone formation in troposphere 133 . The neat biodiesel 100 has been reported to emit 16 more NOx than the mineral diesel 135 . However a study by Sahoo et al. 136 has shown a lower NOx emission 4 less from neat biodiesel derived from polanga oil Calophyllum inophyllum L. as compared to mineral diesel at full load. The reason for a better performance by polanga oil biodiesel has been attributed to engine geometry compression ratio and lower temperature in the combustion chamber. A high ﬂame temperature results in high NOx emissions 137 . Fang et al. 138 reported that low temperature combustion of biodiesel which could be achieved by retarding injection timing late injection . This can effectively reduce NOx emission because a lesser thermal NOx is formed. Glaude et al. 139 reported that the emission of NOx from biodiesel and mineral diesel are comparable as they both contain double bonds. The fatty acid alkyl esters biodiesel comprises of unsaturated double bonds and saturated single bond fatty acids whereas mineral diesel contains aro- matics and naphthenoaromatics unsaturated species among the hydrocarbons. The NOx emission in biodiesel is enhanced by the presence of these unsaturated species. A high NOx emission has been correlated with high ﬂame temperature Tf . Thus among the biodiesel the presence of large amount of unsaturated bonds leads to a high ﬂame temperature Tf whereas high content of saturated bonds leads to a smaller Tf. A lower Tf is usually observed with FAAE than with the mineral diesel that comprises predomi- nantly of hydrocarbons . The reason attributed is that the carbon atom in FAAE is bound to two oxygen atoms within a carboxylic group thus not contributing to the heat of combustion. The generation of CO2 molecule from the carboxylic acid present in the FAAE consumes sensible heat generated by the reaction products thus lowering the ﬂame temperature 139 . Lackey and Paulson 140 reported a better performance of exhaust emissions from biodiesel obtained from the edible feed- stock soybean canola as compared to the feedstock of waste origin yellow grease . A higher particulate matter PM emission rate was also observed from yellow grease derived biodiesel as compared to mineral diesel. It is reported that the mean mobility diameter of the PM emitted from biodiesel exhaust ranges from 27 smaller to 9 larger than that of diesel. The emission rate of elemental carbon EC and black carbon BC was found to be higher using yellow grease biodiesel as compared to soybean and canola based biodiesel. The reason with high emission rate of EC and BC may be the presence of burnt particulates in the yellow grease as the feedstock may have undergone polymerization hydrogenation or oxidation at high temperature. The ﬁndings placed biodiesel from soybean or canola to be advantageous as compared to that from yellow grease obtained from waste oil feedstock. Surawski et al. 141 developed biodiesel from three feedstocks viz. soy tallow and canola and measured the concentration of particles vapor phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAH and reactive oxygen species ROS from the exhaust of biodiesel blended with mineral diesel B20 B40 B60 and B80 . The particulate matter of aerodynamic size 10 mm PM10 showed reduction of 43 and 92 with B20 and B100 respectively from soy oil derived biodiesel. Whereas the reduction was 58 and 88 for tallow oil with B20 and B80 respectively and 65 and 88 for canola oil with B20 and B80 respectively. The fuel type and blend percentage signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the particle number size dis- tribution. Though the three biodiesel fuels were efﬁcient in the reduction of the particle number concentration at larger mobility diameters 4200 nm the concentration of nanoparticles emitted was increased signiﬁcantly in case of smaller mobility diameters B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 227 o50 nm for canola and tallow based biodiesel. The effect of the feedstock was observed to be more signiﬁcant in case of reduction percentage in particle and vapor phase PAH amounting to a minimum of 16 and maximum of 84 for tallow based biodiesel. The reduction observed with canola based biodiesel was no change to 62 decrease whereas for the soy based feedstock the difference was 4 increase to 59 decrease with the biodiesel blends. Similarly the ROS concentration was reduced by 21 for B20 tallow and increased by 16 for B20 canola 141 . The exhaust emission from mineral diesel also contains muta- genic and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that stick on the surface of particulates to a large extent and even to gaseous phase to a small extent. Moreover with the economics being a major concern in the commercialization of biodiesel unmodiﬁed vegetable oil that possesses a high viscosity are being diverted for production of biodiesel. This causes higher engine deposits than the modiﬁed vegetable oils 130 . Karavalakis et al. 142 reported higher hydrocarbon and PAH emissions from the feedstock com- prising of high constituent of esters of saturated fatty acid. The saturated blends portion of biodiesel causes a low volatility resulting in incomplete vaporization and combustion of the fuel. Thus the biodiesel derived from palm oil showed higher hydro- carbon emissions than that derived from rapeseed oil. On contrary Çelikten et al. 143 reported similar performance of fuel proper- ties from rapeseed and soybean derived biodiesel. The disparity in the performance of fuel due to the feedstock warrants for a meticulous selection of the oil or fats for the synthesis of biodiesel. A major concern with non-edible plant based oil feedstocks can be the emission of toxins present in the feedstock that may remain in the biodiesel if not removed during puriﬁcation. Non-edible plant species are also known to possess toxins phorbol esters in J. curcas saponins in M. indica cyano lipids in S. triguga and the effect of these on the combustion of biodiesel has not been taken in consideration. Thus the biodiesel fuel emissions from non- edible feedstocks should be tested for the toxins that are present in the virgin oil. 4.2. Characterization of biodiesel and their fuel properties The utilization of biodiesel as a fuel has certain advantages and disadvantages. Among the advantages is its renewable nature being readily available high cetane number biodegradability better combustion efﬁciency and low emission of toxic constitu- ents viz. sulfur aromatic content and particulate matter . The disadvantages include a high viscosity as compared to mineral diesel comparatively low energy content poor cold ﬂow proper- ties which makes it unsuitable for use in countries where cold climate prevails low oxidation stability needs antioxidants to be added a high emission of oxides of nitrogen compromise with engine performance due to lowered torque as compared to mineral diesel and a high price mostly attributed to high feed- stock cost 144 . The characterization of the biodiesel is an important aspect for the adherence of the fuel to governing speciﬁcations. There are national as well as internationally accredited speciﬁcations for biodiesel quality. Several speciﬁcations for biodiesel standards include American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM D 6751 USA DIN 51606 Germany European Organization EN 14214 and India IS 15607 61 . These speciﬁcations are inter- nationally accepted for biodiesel. Various countries have their own speciﬁcations for biodiesel. Contaminants may enter biodiesel fuel via many ways and resulting in the fuel going off-speciﬁcation. The quantiﬁcation of the contaminants important in terms of prevent- ing damage to the engines and voiding manufacturer warrantees. The characterization of biodiesel includes the FAAE content physical properties density viscosity and fuel properties ﬂash point oxidation stability cetane number and others . The biodiesel should meet the international speciﬁcations 145 . Nuclear mag- netic resonance has emerged as a promising tool for the char- acterization of fatty acid methyl esters FAME in biodiesel 146 . Various researchers have utilized NMR as a fast and accurate tool to determine the extent of conversion of triglycerides to FAME. Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance FT-NMR spectro- scopy has gained immense importance and has developed as an important tool in the characterization of biodiesel and biodiesel blends 124 . In NMR spectroscopy commonly employed protons are 1H or 13C though 31P has been used in some of the studies by researchers. Flores et al. 147 studied the blends of various types of biodiesel obtained from castor cotton peanut pinion soybean and tallow oils. With the 1H NMR spectra it was possible to determine the composition of biodiesel obtained from various feedstocks and also of their blend with mineral diesel. The 1H NMR spectra of the biodiesel can be augmented for the analysis of correlation between viscosity and crystallization the two impor- tant parameters in the speciﬁcation described by ASTM D6751 of biodiesel blends. Although there are several feedstocks available for the synthesis of biodiesel their applicability as a fuel for substitution or blend with mineral diesel will be considered only after they adhere to the speciﬁed fuel properties. Hence the fuel that is derived from a particular feedstock should not only be sufﬁcient for large scale production but also fulﬁll the criteria speciﬁed by national international speciﬁcations 148 . The fuel properties of biodiesel derived from several plants and animal based feedstocks waste cooking and waste frying oils have shown compliance with the ASTM D 6751 speciﬁcations. The data on the fuel properties of biodiesel from microalgal oil is scanty and needs to be observed before they can be utilized as a transport fuel. Among the wide range of parameters that comprises of the fuel properties the cold ﬂow property and the oxidation stability of the fuel demands special attention because of their inverse relation- ship. The issue with microalgal oil is that it comprises of consti- tuents other than triglycerides and free fatty acids viz. hydrocarbons sterols sterol esters wax and alcohol 49 . These constituents ought to inﬂuence not only its esteriﬁcation and or transesteriﬁcation but also its fuel properties. Among these con- stituents hydrocarbons are expected to enhance or supplement to the fuel properties of microalgal derived biodiesel but the same cannot be predicted for other constituents. The hydrocarbon content varies in the microalgal feedstock and is found to be very high in some of the species viz. B. braunii . Caloriﬁc value is an important parameter for the utility of a fuel in CI engine. The caloriﬁc value of methyl esters biodiesel is lower than the mineral diesel because of the oxygen content in the former that is helpful in complete combustion of the fuel in engine 149 . Kanda et al. 150 reported the caloriﬁc value of lipid extracted from blue-green microalgae Microcystis aeruginosa to be 33.8 MJ kg 1. However the gross caloriﬁc value and net caloriﬁc value of biomass of Chlorella sp. was found to be comparably low 18.5970.42 and 15.8870.39 MJ kg 1 . With a ﬁxed carbon content of 15.0871.21 wt and elemental carbon content of 47.54 wt the de-oiled cake of the microalgae was proposed to be suitable for thermo-chemical conversion via pyrolysis to biochar and bio-oil 151 . Ahmad et al. 21 reported a high heating value from the bio-oil obtained from microalgal oil 29 MJ kg 1 as compared to that from wood 21 MJ kg 1 . Though the stability of the bio-oil obtained from microalgae was less as compared to the fossil oil it was higher than that obtained from the wood. Thus microalgal oil has been proposed to be a better option for fuel oil than the lingo-cellulosic material wood . Sydney et al. 152 found that the biodiesel developed from the microalgae B. braunii LEM 14 comprised predominantly of palmi- tic C16 0 21 and oleic acetate C18 1 47 followed by steric B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 228 C18 0 4 linolenic C18 2 7 and α-linolenic acetate C18 3 8 . Table 8 depicts the caloriﬁc value obtained from microalgae and plant species 30 103 150 153 155 . The maximum water content in biodiesel is speciﬁed not to exceed 500 mg kg 1 by ASTM D6751 speciﬁcations. As the ester- iﬁcation reaction results in the production of water scope for biodiesel to become contaminated with water. This may lead to the fuel going off-speciﬁcation during storage. The presence of water may also promote the growth of microbes in the storage tanks which could lead to corrosion of metallic parts with which the fuel comes into contact. The presence of water may further lead to formation of sludge and slime which could result in blockage of fuel ﬁlters and fuel lines thereby damaging vehicles fuel injection systems. The solubility of water is dependent on the temperature and composition of fuel 156 . Wu et al. 157 reported biodiesel obtained from Trichosporon capitatum to have a better cold ﬁlter plugging point CFFP . While the CFPP for biodiesel from T. capitatum was 15 1C the values reported for soybean olive high oleic sunﬂower rapeseed and corn oil were 5 6 6 10 12 respectively. This has been attributed to a high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids total 89 that comprised mainly of oleic acid 80 . Though the biodiesel possessed a good low temperature property in terms of CFPP the fuel may bear a low oxidation stability due presence of high unsaturated fatty acid alkyl esters. 5. Sustainable approaches for biodiesel production from plant oil Plants and trees that bear seed or kernels are usually grown worldwide citing their efﬁciency to convert carbon dioxide to oxygen. Many countries have minimum criteria to have a dedi- cated portion of land for forestation. India South Africa Brazil and several other countries have signiﬁcant landmass occupied by forestry. Given the stringent environmental laws that many countries follow efforts to increase the land under forestry are underway. Many of the wild trees have the potential to produce oil in their seed and kernels. Furthermore several of these oil producing trees are non-edible as they contain toxins. Thus the oil from these plants and trees offer an easy mode of access for its utilization as the feedstock in the synthesis of biodiesel. They can be easily planted in the unutilized arable land e.g. adjacent to railway tracks and or un-arable land by enhancing their pro- ductivity through scientiﬁc methods . Once grown as a plant or tree they can provide dual beneﬁt of oil as feedstock for biodiesel and ﬁxation of carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas aside from providing scenic beauty and conservation of natural resources. Monoculture of plant species has been explored to provide an easier route for the collection of the seeds. The most commonly used feedstock that has become synonymous with biodiesel is J. curcas. This feedstock has often been cultivated in the form of monoculture. Recently there have been advancements to enhance the lipid content in the seeds by genetic engineering. The monoculture of the plants suitable for a high lipid yield of fatty acids prone to esteriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation can also be grown as mixed crop with the edible crops or separately in wastelands. Another approach in the production of biodiesel is its synthesis at room temperature. Many tropical nations like Sub-Saharan African and Asian countries have tropical climates where room tempera- tures can go beyond 30 1C. Though the synthesis of biodiesel is an endothermic reaction some of the feedstock has shown their conversion to FAAE at comparable rate. The puriﬁcation of biodiesel is almost a mandatory step to meet the stringent international speciﬁcations. The reason for the puriﬁcation of biodiesel can be attributed to formation of side products such as soap water and emulsiﬁed products. The catalysts also play an important role in the methods and puriﬁcation steps that is desired to meet the speciﬁca- tions for biodiesel. The homogeneous catalyst despite their high activity results in loss of the products FAAE through repeated washing. Heterogeneous catalysts offer a high catalytic activity even in presence of FFA and water and could lead to easy separation of glycerol from biodiesel are preferable 158 . 5.1. Cultivation of plant crops in wasteland The sustainability of biodiesel as a renewable fuel can be achieved if the feedstock crops are grown on wastelands. Ruan et al. 159 studied the growth of Datura candida Xanthium sibiricum Kosteletzkya pentacarpos Hibiscus trionum and Rhus typhina on unproductive agricultural lands to produce biodiesel. All the plants except R. typhina were found to be suitable for cultivation on the basis of their seed oil content ranging from 17.5 for H. trionum to 41.9 for X. sibiricum . The plant R. typhina possessed a low oil content of 9.7 and was reported unsuitable for cultivation. Plants that have a good potential for growth and oil productivity in the seed or kernels can be planted on the unutilized lands. Misra and Murthy 160 reported that 33 million hectares of wasteland in India could be utilized for the production of biodiesel. Growing J. curcas on the wasteland barren and underutilized land could provide a large scale production of feedstock for biodiesel. Azam et al. 61 projected that utilizing wastelands for the cultivation of plant crops Azadirachta indica and P. pinnata on 40.96 and 19.9 million hectares of land would be sufﬁcient to meet the target of 100 replacement of imported biodiesel in India that amounted to 87.5 million tons in 2003 2004. Among the feedstocks J. curcas is considered to be a multipurpose crop as it can be used in fencing as well as utilizing its seeds for extracting oil 161 . Biswas et al. 151 emphasizes Table 8 Caloriﬁc value of biodiesel from some microalgae and plant oil.

GCV¼Gross caloriﬁc value. NCV¼Net caloriﬁc value. B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 229 that around 4 million hectares of wasteland along the railway tracks roads and canals can be utilized for the plantation of J. curcas in India. It is estimated that cultivation of J. curcas on 10 million hectare of wasteland could yield oil that could produce 5 million tones of biodiesel. Though concerns have been raised on the utilization of wastelands. Findlater et al. 162 states that there could be local impacts on the poor and marginal communities that depend on these wastelands . As the plantation of J. curcas on the wastelands may continue for a long time period any adverse environmental impact on the soil ecosystem or indirect impact on mankind will have a profound effect. The effect of J. curcas on the wasteland have been identiﬁed as low seed yield and loss of fodder for the animals. Kumar et al. 163 reported that the wastelands identiﬁed for cultivation of J. curcas in India was being used for marginal farming by landless laborers and as grazing ground. Some of the identiﬁed wasteland was found to be remotely located. Montobbio and Lele 164 also report that the information on the region speciﬁc ﬁeld performance of J. curcas on the identiﬁed wasteland is very limited. 5.2. Room temperature synthesis of biodiesel The synthesis of biodiesel at room temperature offers a good opportunity to decrease the energy input in the production of biodiesel. As the synthesis of biodiesel is an endothermic process the tropical countries will be naturally more suited for the room temperature of biodiesel. Sharma et al. 165 reported room temperature 35 1C synthesis of biodiesel from waste frying oil using homogeneous catalysts NaOH and CH3ONa and methanol as reactant. Pramanik et al. 166 reported on room temperature 25 1C for the synthesis of biodiesel whereby an acid catalyst HZnPS-1 was found to give FAAE yield of 81.5 wt though the extent of conversion is low when compared with the EN speciﬁca- tion min. value of 96.5 . The reason for the low FAAE yield may be as a function of the reaction being done at the comparatively low temperature 25 1C for 24 h with 5 wt catalyst. Co-solvents have been found to be effective in enhancing the transesteriﬁca- tion rate when the reaction temperature is comparatively low. Guan et al. 167 utilized soybean oil for synthesis of biodiesel at 25 1C in a closed batch reactor using various co-solvents dimethyl ester diethyl ester tert-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran with KOH as catalyst. The reaction was complete in 20 min using the co-solvent whereas in the absence of a co-solvent only 78 conversion could be achieved. It was observed that performing the reaction in a microtube reactor system could enhance the mass transfer. Sun et al. 168 performed room temperature 25 1C synthesis of soybean oil using Ca4SiO6 as solid base catalyst. The yield of FAAE was comparatively low ca. 80 with a 10 h reaction time. When subjected to a higher temperature methanol reﬂux the FAAE yield was increased to 95 in 2 h reaction time. When NaOH a homogeneous catalyst was used high FAAE yield was obtained. Hence temperature is an important parameter in obtaining a high conversion of feedstock to biodiesel and depends on the catalyst used in the reaction. 5.3. A hybrid feedstock for synthesis of biodiesel With scarcity in feedstocks a hybrid feedstock can be one of the solutions to support a biodiesel industry. A blend of feedstocks can offer the advantage of a better quality of biodiesel with desired fuel properties viz. enhanced oxidation stability better cold ﬂow proper- ties and a lowered corrosion to engine parts. Few researchers have utilized hybrid feedstocks for the synthesis of biodiesel. Qiu et al. 102 used edible feedstocks soybean and rapeseed oil to derive biodiesel using NaOH as a catalyst. The acid value of soybean oil and rapeseed oil was 0.9762 and 1.631 mg KOH g 1 respectively which made the single step transesteriﬁcation feasible for the feedstocks. However the second generation feedstocks non-edible usually have a high acid value 44.0 mg KOH g 1 and thus either two step process comprising of esteriﬁcation with homogeneous catalyst followed by transesteriﬁcation or a single step esteriﬁcation utiliz- ing a solid acid catalyst with high catalytic activity is adopted. Sharma and Singh 70 utilized P. pinnata and M. indica in a 50 50 ratio and found a similar yield and conversion of biodiesel as compared to that of the individual feedstocks in a two-step process viz. esteriﬁcation with H2SO4 followed by transesteriﬁcation with KOH as base catalyst. Ethier et al. 169 utilized chicken fat and soybean oil mixture in 50 50 ratios for synthesis of biodiesel. A similarity between biodiesel and mineral diesel is their multi- component composition. While the mineral diesel comprises of a mixture of hydrocarbons biodiesel comprises of a mixture of fatty acid alkyl esters. Nogueira et al. 81 blended babassu seed oil with cotton seed and babassu seed oil soybean oil separately to obtain biodiesel. The density of biodiesel obtained from babassu oil was lower than that obtained from cotton seed and soybean oil because of shorter chain length in the former. The viscosity of the babassu oil biodiesel was also lower than that of cotton seed and soybean oil biodiesel due to low density. Though the conversion of the biodiesel has not been reported it was found that the density of the biodiesel obtained from the mixture of feedstocks theoretically correlated with the experimental values with a relative difference of o0.21 . Chen et al. 170 utilized a blend of soapnut oil methyl ester SME and jatropha oil methyl ester JME to obtain a better fuel quality of biodiesel. The SME contains high percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids that imparts good oxidation stability. Whereas JME contains a large amount of unsaturated double bonds that renders the fuel to poor oxidation stability. Hence in order to get biodiesel with improved fuel properties the biodiesel were blended. The blend ratio of 35 65 by weight of SME JME was observed to be improve the cold ﬁlter plugging point and oxidation stability of the biodiesel. With the use of biodiesel derived from two different feedstocks the blend of biodiesel with diesel up to B40 was found to show satisfactory fuel properties. Meneghetti et al. 171 used mixture of three vegetable oils cottonseed soybean and castor for the synth- esis of biodiesel. It was observed that blend improved the puriﬁca- tion process. Castor oil possessed a high viscosity 225.8 mm2 s 1 at 40 1C which may be a deterrent in its application as a neat biodiesel hamper. However it offers an excellent lubricity and its blend with other feedstock may enhance some of the characteristics of the biodiesel. 5.4. Continuous transesteriﬁcation for production of biodiesel The biodiesel industry will rely on continuous production of biodiesel because of its operational beneﬁts and easy implementa- tion at industrial scale. Several researchers have proposed con- tinuous production of biodiesel. An excellent review on the continuous production of biodiesel has been described by Qiu et al. 172 where various process intensiﬁcation technologies in the synthesis of biodiesel have been discussed in detail. Reactors that provide continuous production of biodiesel included static mixers micro-channel reactors oscillatory ﬂow reactors cavita- tional reactors rotating spinning tube reactors and microwave reactors. Membrane reactors reactive distillation and centrifugal contractors offer simultaneous reaction and separation of the products obtained after transesteriﬁcation. It has been reported that new processes for the synthesis of biodiesel reactor rate are enhanced by intensifying the transport process and enhanced mixing between alcohol and oil. A continuous transesteriﬁcation for production of biodiesel has been described by He et al. 173 using anion-exchange resin D261 as catalyst in a ﬁx bed reactor. However the biodiesel which comprises of FAME constituted only B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 230 90 up to a run time of 4 h and decreased to 23.7 in 8 h. This shows that catalyst has to be added continuously to make the production of biodiesel up to the desired level 173 . Kwon et al. 174 demonstrated a non-catalytic thermo-chemical process as a continuous system for simultaneous esteriﬁcation and transester- iﬁcation of animal fat comprising of beef tallow and lard utilizing charcoal as a porous material and CO2. A conversion of 98.5 70.5 was achieved in only 1 min though a comparatively high temperature 350 500 1C was used for the synthesis of biodiesel. CO2 has been hypothesized to cause dissociation of bonds at high temperature and impeding the reversible reaction during transes- teriﬁcation. Hsieh et al. 121 used a packed bed reactor for the continuous production of biodiesel from soybean oil. A high yield of biodiesel 95 was obtained in 168.2 min catalyzed by a solid base catalyst Ca C3H7O3 2 CaCO3 . Santana et al. 18 utilized supercritical alcohol ethanol and solvent carbon dioxide for the continuous production of biodiesel using a solid acid catalyst. The advantage of this process was the formation of biodiesel in a short reaction time 6 min . However the disadvantages were the high consumption of energy as a high temperature 150 to 200 1C and pressure 200 bar along with a high molar ratio of vegetable oil to ethanol 1 25 were taken. The optimum yield of biodiesel obtained was comparatively low 80 and the FAAE constituent were also o90 . da Silva et al. 175 used continuous production of biodiesel from soybean oil by transesteriﬁcation in supercritical conditions. The yield of FAAE obtained was found to be higher in a microtube reactor inner diameter 0.76 mm as compared to that obtained from tubular reactor inner diameter 3.2 mm . This was likely due to better mass transfer being facilitated inside the microtube reactor. The use of CO2 as co-solvent was found not to enhance the yield of FAAE signiﬁcantly. The operating conditions for the reaction were temperature 325 1C pressure 15 to 20 MPa and ethanol to oil molar ratio 40 1 and 20 1. As a high reaction temperature was subjected a small amount of fatty acids o5.0 wt was decomposed. Hu et al. 176 demonstrated a continuous ﬂow integrated process for the development of bio- diesel from rapeseed oil using KF loaded on CaO KF CaO as a solid base catalyst. The contact area of gas liquid is larger than that of liquid liquid and thus has been projected to provide better biodiesel production efﬁciency. The continuous process comprised of three ﬂuidic modules and one rectiﬁcation column. Each ﬂuidic module comprised of three zones. The upper zone augmented condensation of methanol vapor the middle zone comprised of a microporous solid base catalyst and the lower zone utilized an online separator for the separation of biodiesel and glycerol. The KF CaO was found to work for 144 h with easy and automatic separation of biodiesel and glycerol thus overcoming the require- ment of washing with water. Behzadi and Farid 112 reported on a process for continuous production of biodiesel from fats and oils with a high reaction rate and less cleaning than required for crude biodiesel. The fats and oil were atomized to provide a larger surface area allowing better contact of oil and methanol which facilitated a high reaction rate thus reducing the reaction time to few seconds. Atomization of the oil fat was done using high pressure diesel injection pump which resulting in a droplet size of 100 200 mm. The atomized oil fat was dispersed in a reaction chamber that contained vapors of metha- nol in a counter current ﬂow arrangement. They found that a high reaction temperature lower than the degradation temperature of the oil i.e.r200 1C can be utilized for esteriﬁcation transester- iﬁcation. Thanh et al. 177 used an ultrasonic reactor for the continuous production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil WCO . Two step transesteriﬁcation was adopted whereby WCO and alcohol was added at difference molar ratios and catalyst amount. WCO and methanol were added to the reactor by piston and peristaltic pump respectively. The step wise addition of methanol led to a faster separation of the glycerol from biodiesel. As the density of glycerol 1.26 g cm 3 is much higher than that of methanol 0.79 g cm 3 a high amount of methanol in the glycerol lowers the density of the mixture thus rendering their separation difﬁcult. The optimized molar ratios methanol to WCO in the ﬁrst and second step were 2.5 1 and 1.5 1 respec- tively. The amount of catalyst loaded in the ﬁrst and second step was 0.7 and 0.3 wt respectively. Ultrasonic irradiation augments the formation of ﬁne emulsions of immiscible liquids oil and alcohol which increases the interface area between methanol and oil. Thus a short residence time o1 min of the reactants in the ultrasonic reactor in both the two steps was required. The total time for the completion of the reaction separation and puriﬁca- tion took 15 h. Phan et al. 178 designed oscillatory bafﬂed reactors for continuous production of biodiesel. The reactors varied in bafﬂe design viz. central sharp edge bafﬂes helical shaped bafﬂes and axially oriented sharp-edged helical bafﬂes. The bafﬂed reactors offered plug-ﬂow of the immiscible liquids oil and alcohol at lower oscillatory Reynolds numbers. The central sharp edge bafﬂes and helical shaped bafﬂes suffered a few limitations. Homogeneity was not found in central sharp edge bafﬂes designed reactor. A better but still incomplete homogeneity was observed in helical shaped bafﬂe reactor that resulted in segregation of the biodiesel rich phase and the glycerol rich phase. A greater shear force at the bafﬂe edge offered a more homo- geneous mixture by effective mixing of the two phase in sharp- edged helical bafﬂe reactor. The non-catalytic continuous transes- teriﬁcation of reﬁned palm oil has been proposed by Joelianingsih et al. 179 in a bubble column reactor BCR . The BCR has been proposed to initiate reaction and distillation in a single step. The products formed were continuously removed while the oil was retained in the reactive zone. The products formed were in gaseous phase whereas the reactant oil was in the liquid phase. The yield of biodiesel enhanced with the increase in methanol feed ﬂow rate and reaction temperature. Fatty acid methyl ester biodiesel yield of 94 has been reported in 240 180 and 90 min at reaction temperature of 250 270 and 290 1C. However the high reaction temperature 250 290 1C for the production of biodiesel ought to make the production cost energy intensive. Ren et al. 180 used a ﬁxed bed reactor packed with an anion- exchange resin D261 as a heterogeneous catalyst for continuous production of biodiesel using co-solvents methyl tert-butyl ether n-hexane tert-butyl alcohol and tetra-hydrofuran . Methanol oil and co-solvent n-hexane were pre-heated prior to their injection in the reactor using a peristaltic pump. The addition of n-hexane as co-solvent resulting in the reactants becoming homogeneous thereby improving the reaction rate and resulting in a high conversion of FAAE. The advantage this process was regeneration of the catalyst in-situ. The regeneration of the catalyst was carried out in a three step process which involved ﬂushing with methanol ﬂow rate 10 mL min 1 for 20 min to remove adsorbed organics viz. glycerol washing with 5.0 wt dissolved in methanol ﬂow rate 1.5 mL min 1 for 90 min to restore the activity of resin and again washed with methanol to neutralize the pH. Apart from acting as an active catalyst the anion-exchange resin also adsorbed glycerol resulting in a pure FAAE. Chongkhong et al. 181 proposed the use of a continuous stirred tank reactor CSTR followed by puriﬁcation of the products for the continuous esteriﬁcation of palm fatty acid distillate. The biodiesel yield 97 of the continuous process was lower than the batch process 99 . However better conversion FAAE of 97.3 was achieved in comparison to batch process where the FAAE content was 93.9 before puriﬁcation. Continuous processes have been proved to be a great tool while using biocatalysts for biodiesel production. Lipases are known for their inactivation by short chain alcohols and glycerol. The continuous B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 231 process provides a solution for lipase inactivation by alcohol whereby alcohol can be easily added in step wise manner and co-solvent synthesis can be effectively carried out. Glycerol inhibition is addressed as glycerol can be continuously removed. Continuous process using both extracellular and intracellular lipases has been reported by researchers 182 184 . Methanolysis of soybean oil by immobilized lipase Novozyme 435 in tert-butanol was carried out in packed bed reactor. Optimized reaction conditions of ﬂow rate 0.1 mL min 1 52.1 1C and methanol to oil molar ratio of 4 1 gave 82.8170.98 biodiesel conversion. No decrease in activity of Novozyme 435 was seen for 30 days continuous operation of packed bed reactor 185 . 6. Sustainable approaches for biodiesel from microalgal oil Synthesis of biodiesel has gathered immense interest world- wide. However their viability as an alternative and renewable fuels need to be justiﬁed in terms of their sustainability avail- ability of adequate oil and techno-economics. The cultivation of microalgae is cost intensive at present and several efforts have been made to lower the cost making the production cost of biodiesel feasible. Many researchers have adopted an optimistic view on microalgal biofuels. Chisti 186 stated that microalgal biodiesel seems to be the only renewable fuel that has the potential to completely replace the mineral derived liquid trans- port fuel. However its cost should be reduced to one-tenth the current cost in order to make it competitive. The approach towards improved sustainability of biodiesel derived from microalgal oil includes selection of a suitable species that could be cultivated with minimal energy inputs. The dry biomass and lipid productiv- ity should be high. Energy inputs can be decreased by recycling the water using natural light and applying the best techniques for the cultivation and extraction of oil. Microalgae can be grown using municipal and industrial wastewater thus leading to environmen- tal sustainability. In an attempt for their long term sustainability several approaches that can be considered sustainable have come up 20 49 187 . 6.1. Scope of wastewater as a nutrient medium for the cultivation of microalgae The treatment of wastewater arising from several industries is a major concern and requires large energy inputs. The non-compliance of the treatment of the wastewater also results in polluting the river and the aquatic fauna therein. The culture of the microalgae offers a dual beneﬁt of treatment of wastewater and low cost culture of microalgae thus saving on the nutrient dose 187 . The cost of tertiary wastewater treatment for the removal of residual nitrogen phosphorous and heavy metals requires large infrastruc- ture and bears a high cost. Abdel-Raouf 188 reported that the cultivation of microalgae using wastewater as a substrate could be a solution to tertiary and quandary treatment of wastewater with the added beneﬁt of biomass production that can be used for several purposes. The microalgae can remove biochemical oxygen demand BOD nitrogen phosphorous heavy metals and have inhibited the growth of coliforms. The presence of nitrogen and phosphorous in wastewater can be used as a source of nutrient for the production of biodiesel. Subashchandrabose et al. 189 reported that microalgae utilize ammonium nitrate and phosphate as nutrients. These are common constituents present in wastewater. Microalgae grown using wastewater can serve the dual purpose of wastewater treat- ment as well as reduction in the cost incurred in the culture of microalgae 187 . Wu et al. 190 utilized industrial wastewater from industrial park for the culture of Chlamydomonas sp. The lipid proﬁle of the fatty acid produced were predominantly palmitic acid 61.1 followed by linolenic acid 21.1 stearic acid 6.7 palmitoleic acid 6.2 and myristic acid 4.9 after a 10 days culture period. Though the content of linolenic acid was low 10.2 and 11.1 in the 6th and 8th day of the cultivation respectively the high value of linolenic acid 21.1 obtained on the 10th day of the cultivation poses a concern and thus will have to be harvested by the 8th day to ensure the presence of linolenic acid remains within the acceptable limits of European Standards EN 2004 . Mohan and Devi 191 utilized acid rice efﬂuents discharged from biohydrogen production facility from food waste products which served as a carbon sources for the microalgae. Volatile fatty acids which comprises of carbon chain backbones are generated during biohydrogen production supports microalgal biomass production as well as lipid accumulation. Lipid and biomass productivity was compared using both synthetic volatile fatty acids and fermented fatty acids from the efﬂuent as carbon source. The lipid content of the microalgae which comprised of a mixed culture obtained from a lentic water body receiving domestic efﬂuents was 26.4 while the biomass production was 1.4270.02 mg mL 1 for the fermen- ted fatty acids. The treatment of the wastewater was also observed while cultivation of microalgae with fermented fatty acid and the chemical oxygen demand COD removal efﬁciency up to 91.4 was observed. Xin et al. 16 used Scenedesmus sp. for the production of biodiesel utilizing secondary treated wastewater efﬂuent as a source of nutrients. A high removal efﬁciency of 98 with respect to inorganic nutrients was observed in 10 days. The lipid accumulation productivity had a maximum value of 0.008 g L 1 d 1 on the 10th day. Zhang et al. 192 studied the efﬁciency of wastewater treatment during the heterotrophic cultivation of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and the impact of bacteria on the productivity of algal biomass and lipid content. Though the coexistence of bacteria with microalgae had insigniﬁcant effect on productivity of biomass in the latter the total lipid content in algae and lipid production rate were slightly reduced. The reason attributed to the decreased lipid content and lipid productivity was the competing nature of bacteria with microalgae for nutri- ents. Li et al. 193 investigated the efﬁciency of various strains of C. vulgaris for the treatment of citric acid efﬂuent and biomass production. An increasing tendency in the peak average speciﬁc growth rate of C. vulgaris C9-JN2010was observed upon dilution of citric acid efﬂuent 0.670.01 0.7470.02 and 0.9870.04 g L 1 at 10 15 and 20 dilution respectively in 5 days of cultivation. The dry biomass content began to decrease at higher concentra- tion of citric acid efﬂuent and was 0.8470.03 0.6770.01 and 0.5670.01 g L 1 at 40 60 and 80 respectively in 5 days of cultivated period. The removal of COD BOD total organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous was 490 . The polyunsaturated fatty acid constituent in the extracted lipids was highest i.e. 73.4 followed by saturated fatty acids 22.5 and monounsaturated fatty acids 3.5 . Martinez et al. 194 utilized pretreated wastewater obtained from submerged membrane bioreactor for the culture of micro- algae. A semi-continuous mode of cultivation of microalgae mixed culture resulted in biomass productivity of 234 mg L 1 d 1 oper- ated over 42 days. A high nutrient removal efﬁciency of 97.873.9 was observed for phosphate PO4 3-P and 67.2 for ammonium NH4 þ-N which were utilized by microalgae by transformation into biomass. The pH was maintained at 7.2 to ensure that the nitrogen and phosphorous removal was only due to growth of biomass and not due to ammonia stripping which occurs at pH49. Riaño et al. 195 reported 70 removal of the total chemical oxygen demand TCOD and phosphate by growing microalgae in a photobioreactor with wastewater obtained after processing of ﬁsh. Chinnasamy et al. 80 utilized wastewater efﬂuent from carpet industry in combination with the municipal sewage water for cultivation of microalgae to be utilized as B. Singh et al.

The consortium of microalgal isolates along with four microalgal species two belonging from freshwater B. braunii Chlorella saccharophila and other two were from marine Dunaliella tertiolecta Pleurochrysis carterae environment. It was found that both the treated and untreated wastewater from carpet industry supported the growth of both marine and freshwater microalgae. The reason attributed to the adaptability of marine species in wastewater has been the osmotic adjustment and regulation mechanism to tolerate hypo osmotic stress conditions by the marine microalgae. Among the studied species all except D. tertiolecta showed a better growth rate in treated as well as untreated wastewater. The biodiesel production from the microalgal biomass has been projected to be 9.2 17.8 t ha 1 yr 1. Around 63.9 of the algal oil was found to be converted to biodiesel 80 . Table 9 describes the utility of wastewater in the cultivation of microalgae and removal of nutrients. 6.2. Carbon sequestration potential of microalgae Carbon dioxide is the major contributor to the global warming 196 . CO2 is a source of carbon for photosynthesis and to enhanced oil and natural gas recovery production of urea and for carbonation of food and beverages. Using photosynthetic microorganisms as a sink for carbon dioxide offers an attractive alternative as their efﬁciency to sequester CO2 is three to ﬁve folds higher than the plants 197 . As the microalgae can grow faster than the terrestrial plants the efﬁciency to ﬁx CO2 can range from 10 to 50 198 . The content of CO2 in water depends on the thermodynamics and mass transfer 199 . The CO2 that can be effectively sequestered in aquatic environments by microalgae is limited by the Henry s Law. Thus temperature of the liquid and partial pressure of CO2 above the liquid play an important role in sequestration of CO2. While most plants can accumulate carbon dioxide up to 0.1 microalgae have the ability to accumulate up to 12 CO2 at 35 1C 199 . Sánchez et al. 200 reported increase in the cell growth rate of 20 when the CO2 supply was at low rate though the authors have not mentioned the CO2 supply rate. The thermal power plants emit ﬂue gases that contain up to 13 CO2 201 . Flue gases from power plants and industrial exhaust gases provide a potential carbon source for the cultivation of microalgae thereby accomplishing CO2 bio-ﬁxation to some level 202 . However the capture of CO2 from these sources is challenging and energy intensive. On-site microalgal cultivation is thought to be technically feasible and economically viable. However microalgal CO2 tolerance varies for different species. Ho et al. 198 reported that the CO2 ﬁxation by microalgae positively correlate with their cell growth rate. Some strains of microalgae are inhibited by CO2 if NOx are also present. Some species have been found to be tolerant of high temperature high CO2 concentration and presence of toxic compounds NOx and SOx . These include Nannochloris sp. Nannochloropsis sp. and Chlorella sp. While Nannochloris sp. and Nannochloropsis sp. have shown CO2 tolerance of 15 various Chlorella sp. have shown tolerance to CO2 varying from 15 to 50 . The CO2 ﬁxation ability of these species ranges from 500 to 1800 mg L 1 d 1. It is suggested that enhancing the light might increase the efﬁciency of microalgae in ﬁxation of CO2. Valdes et al. 203 advocates for evaluation of CO2 ﬁxation efﬁciency by microalgae cultivated in a photobioreactor. They found that CO2 content in water was found to be closely correlated with the photosynthetic activity of the algae. The stripping of CO2 was found to be inﬂuenced by airﬂow rate in the photobioreactor. The injection of CO2 occurred when pH increased to 8. The sequestration of CO2 then leads to an increase in pH. Kaiwan- arporn et al. 79 reported the inlet CO2 supply of 8 concentration to be the optimum amount for its ﬁxation by the cyanobacteria S. aquatilis at the rate of 5.3 g L 1 d 1 in airlift photo-bioreactor. One of the issues pertinent to carbon sequestration is the low mass transfer of CO2 in water and the sensitivity of microalgal species to high CO2 concentrations 204 . High CO2 concentrations induce low pH in the culture medium reducing the activity of extracel- lular carbonic anhydrase which is responsible for the concentra- tion of carbon in microalgal cells 205 . Honda et al. 206 optimized the carbon capture rates for C. vulgaris B. braunii and Spirulina platensis cultivated using sewage sludge as a nutrient source. The carbon capture rate and biomass productivity were optimum when the hydraulic retention time and solids retention time were 1 and 18 days respectively. The production rate of microalgae and CO2 capture rate were found to decrease when starved of phosphorous. The CO2 supply and availability of micro- nutrients were assumed to be the factors affecting the optimal growth of the microalgal species. The improvement of CO2 diffu- sion in water for uptake by microalgae can be enhanced by the use of micro-bubble diffusers 206 . The accumulation of CO2 in microalgae may lead to the production of protein or lipids. The production of lipids is desirable in terms of biodiesel production. Sydney et al. 207 reported the ﬁxation rate of CO2 by D. tertiolecta C. vulgaris S. platensis and B. braunii resulted biomass yields of 496.98 318.61 272.4 252.64 mg L 1 day 1 respectively. Though there was a predominance of proteins in all the four microalgae species a high lipid accumulation of 3372 was observed in B. braunii followed by lower lipid accumulation in D. tertiolecta 11.4471.8 S. platensis 1172.2 and C. vulgaris 9.9572.1 . The other constituents in the microalgae were sugars and pigments. The ﬁxed CO2 can be used by the microalgae to produce carbohydrates lipids proteins and nucleic acids 195 . 6.3. Anaerobic digestion and biogas production from microalgae Anaerobic digestion is a versatile technology for the production of biogas from various industries and domestic wastes comprising of organic matter 208 209 . Microalgal biomass after lipid extrac- tion comprises of proteins and carbohydrates that can be digested via anaerobic means to generate biogas a renewable fuel. This can enhance the economic feasibility of the process of biodiesel synthesis. Sialve at al. 210 proposed anaerobic digestion of algal biomass after lipid extraction and envisaged that the energy generation can be more than that from the extracted lipid itself. The direct energy recovery by anaerobic digestion could also be more proﬁtable when the algal lipid content in microalgae is lower than 40 . However the direct energy recovery from microalgae has challenges viz. low biodegradability of microalgae inﬂuenced by biochemical composition and nature of cell wall high protein content in the cells of microalgae that releases ammonia and can be toxic and presence of sodium in marine microalgal species that can be a hindrance in the performance of the anaerobic digester. Mussgnug et al. 211 found that biogas generated from micro- algae showed a higher methane generating capacity 7 to 13 than from maize silage. The biogas produced by fermentation of microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii showed a high methane content and volatile gas solid of 66 and 587 mL 78.8 SE respectively. Certain strains of microalgae were found to be detrimental to the bacterial community in the fermenter whereas others showed their suitability. The detrimental effects was attributed to from the production of bacteriostatic or bactericidal compounds and indirect effects caused due to toxicity by high protein content and release of free ammonia. Alzate et al. 212 found that the substrate to inoculum ratios S I biomass concen- tration and pretreatment methods inﬂuences the biodegradability and methane production potential from the microalgae by anae- robic digestion. The S I ratio and biomass concentration of 0.5 and 10 g TS kg 1 respectively were found to be optimum for high biodegradability and methane production potential of microalgae. B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 234 Pretreatment of the microalgae by thermal hydrolysis enhanced the CH4 productivity by 46 62 . The biological pretreatment resulted in negligible increase in CH4 productivity. Ultrasound enhanced the productivity by 6 to 24 at 10 000 kJ kg 1 total solids. Ehimen et al. 213 investigated the pre-treatment routes of anaerobic digestion of ﬁlamentous algae Rhizoclonium. It was observed that the blending of the biomass coupled with enzymatic pre-treatment improved the methane yield by more than 20 as compared to that from mechanical size reduction. Ehimen et al. 213 also been proposed the methane produced by anaerobic digestion of microalgae glycerol and wastewater for their utility in generation of electricity. The electricity could be used in various stages of production of microalgae i.e. cultivation dewatering and extraction of oil and the subsequent esteriﬁcation transester- iﬁcation of microalgal oil. One of the important aspects of biodiesel production is the generation of glycerol a useful by-product. Glycerol formation is independent of the feedstock or catalyst used. Hence an approach to use this product judiciously is of immense importance. Glycerol in its pure form has numerous applications in cosmetic paint automotive food pharmaceutical pulp and paper leather and textile industries. The glycerol that is derived as a co-product during the synthesis of biodiesel is impure and constitutes on 30 on volume basis. It can be concentrated and can be converted to high purity. However its puriﬁcation poses a challenge and its disposal too is economically and ecologically disadvantageous 214 . The valorization of glycerol along with the wastewater obtained after the treatment of biodiesel can be diverted to the production of methane. Siles et al. 215 reported anaerobic co-digestion of glycerol and wastewater derived from the biodiesel puriﬁcation. The wastewater comprised of traces of biodiesel oil glycerol free fatty acids and methanol. The waste- water was initially demulsiﬁed and separated from oil and biodiesel by acidiﬁcation with H2SO4 and centrifugation. The methane yield coefﬁcient from the co-digestion of glycerol and wastewater has been reported to be 310 mL CH4 g COD removal as compared to 292 mL CH4 g COD removal from glycerol alone at 25 1C and 1 atm pressure. The efﬁciency of the process was approximately 81 thus indicating the COD removal was directly correlated to the methane production. The anaerobic digestion resulted in the production of 1.55 mL of CH4 g VSS volatile suspended solids g COD h and an almost complete biodegradability of wastewater 100 has been reported. Mussgnug et al. 216 utilized six microalgae species freshwater and saltwater as substrates for the production of biogas by anaerobic fermentation. The biogas production potential varied with the species and mode of pretreatment. It has been suggested that the microalgal species should be concentrated before fermentation but complete drying should be avoided as it decreases the biogas generation signiﬁcantly. Table 10 depicts the biogas production from microalgae. 7. Emerging cost-effective methods for production of biodiesel Considering the feedstock to be the major contributor in the total cost incurred in the synthesis process the economics at present favors the waste cooking waste frying and waste animal and ﬁsh fats as feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Biodiesel obtained from used oil and fat has been found to be only margin- ally more expensive than the mineral diesel whereas that from microalgae is many times higher than mineral diesel 217 . The cost of biodiesel from J. curcas in India has been estimated to be US 0.87 per liter without taking in account the tax and proﬁt margin 162 . The cost of algae derived biodiesel stands at US 1.25 lb as compared to US 0.43 lb for petroleum based diesel 40 . How- ever the availability of waste oil and fats is subject to various factors and its collection in an organized pattern has not been reported anywhere. This is followed by plant based oils which are available in substantial amount but ﬁnds other application too viz. soap manufacture medicines etc. There are reports contrary to the general belief that some J. curcas may need less water and fertilizers. They have been found to grow with optimum oil production only when supplied with sufﬁcient nutrients and water. Their cultivation in the wastelands including sodic land and unutilized land adjacent to the railway tracks as adopted in India may offer an opportunity for a constant supply of feedstock oil. The economics at present places microalgal based feedstock at the bottom as they need technical expertise in cultivation harvest- ing and oil extraction which are cost intensive. Atadashi et al. 42 stated that simply using a low cost feedstock can reduce the cost of biodiesel by 25 . Thus utilizing the non-edible and high acid value feedstocks viz. P. pinnata J. curcas castor oil WCO and animal fats have been advocated to bring down the production cost of biodiesel. 7.1. Microalgae cultivation As microalgae have emerged as a potential feedstock for the synthesis of biodiesel there have been several approaches to lowering the production cost of oil from microalgae. This section deals with the approaches that can be adopted to reduce the cost of biodiesel derived from the microalgal oil. Chiaramonti et al. 50 investigated the energy consumption and performance of conven- tional raceway pond with that of an innovative raceway pond. The traditional paddles were replaced with centrifugal pump axial ﬂow propeller and an energy saving of 50 was estimated over an area 500 m2 raceway pond. The innovative raceway pond was designed with a shallower depth 5 cm for a low head of water in pond and increased microalgae concentration. The shallower depth offered reduction in volume of water by 75 and also facilitated an efﬁcient downstream processing separation of microalgae and water as dewatering is considered to contribute a high overall cost. By the lowering the depth the head loss in the pond curves was estimated to be lowered to around 7.5 as compared to the traditional design. Photobioreactors have been continuously used in cultivation of microalgae as light temperature nitrogen starvation and input of nutrients are better controlled thus resulting in a high biomass productivity and lipid yield. Pegallapati et al. 218 emphasized that the energy input should be considered in addition to the biomass productivity per unit volume from the photobioreactor.

B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 235 Hence maximizing the net energy gain is of paramount impor- tance when maximizing the biomass productivity. The approach should be to minimize the energy expense incurred at the various stages involved in microalgal culturing harvesting and extraction of oil and synthesis of biodiesel. High power consumption is one of the major shortcomings of photobioreactor. The use of artiﬁcial light adds to the power consumption and increases capital costs 219 . The use of light emitting diodes has been proposed as a more cost effective method than the use of ﬂuorescent light. Another emerging technology in optimization of biomass produc- tivity of photobioreactors is the usage of light emitting diodes LED as they offer a narrow range of target wavelength. In an algal culture using the LED based photobioreactor the spectral output can be controlled and light intensity and frequency can be adjusted for the desired illumination 220 . It was found that C. vulgaris is able to adapt to light illumination with wavelength of 660 nm by altering its ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b. The biomass density obtained was 20 g L 1 dry cell weight DCW of culture medium and biomass productivity was measured to be 2.11 g L 1 DCW day 1. Though the present technique of the cultivation along with harvesting of microalgal oil and synthesis of biodiesel from microalgae are costly the advancements in the techniques such as lowering the cost of LED in near future can lead to economic feasibility of the overall process. The cost of closed systems is signiﬁcantly higher than open ponds. Photobioreactor require 10 times the capital investment as compared to raceway ponds 221 . Reductive of the cost of construction of closed systems is imperative for the success of biodiesel production from microalgae 222 . It is possible to produce dewatered biomass at a cost ranging from 5.08 to 5.27 US kg 1 dry weight using tubular reactors 223 224 . Costs of mixing may account for a signiﬁcant proportion of the total cost of biomass produced. These costs are approximately 0.10 1.61 and 3.93 US kg 1 for raceway tubular reactors and ﬂat panel reactors respectively 225 . Reduction in the costs of mixing in photobioreactor will signiﬁcantly improve the production economics. Raceway pond production estimates place the cost of dried algal biomass at 0.34 US kg 1. At a predicted lipid productivity of 24 lipid per gram DCW this translates to 1.42 US kg 1 and 209 US bbl lipid. At a more favorable lipid yield of 40 the cost decreases to 0.85 US kg 1 and therefore 126 US bbl 1 226 . Considering the advantages and drawbacks of raceways and photobioreactors the logical step in cost effective biomass produc- tion would be a combination of the technologies. Hybrid systems combine growth in bioreactors and raceway ponds 226 . Hybrid systems have been used historically in aquaculture for the growth of inoculum. This allows production of inoculum free of contam- ination and provides a large enough volume to give the culture of choice a competitive advantage in the open system 226 . The use of hybrid systems for biofuels production utilizes large scale photobioreactors and open ponds sequentially. The ﬁrst stage of growth is undertaken within a bioreactor to maintain culture purity and achieve high biomass concentrations 219 . The second stage is undertaken in a raceway pond as this is ideal for nutrient stress. Hybrid systems can produce as much as 20 30 t ha 1 of lipid annually depend on climate favorability 222 . It has been reported by Acien et al. 60 that among the infrastructure needed in the synthesis of oil from the microalgae photobioreactors offer possibilities where cost can be reduced by simplifying the design and the material used. Norsker et al. 225 estimated that the biomass production cost including dewater- ing by culturing in open pond horizontal tubular photobioreactor and ﬂat panel photobioreactor were 4.95 4.15 and 5.96 kg 1. The design of ﬂat panel photobioreactor closely spaced and vertical ﬂat panel reactor offers light dilution by larger speciﬁc surface and self-shading of the panels which results in a higher photosynthetic efﬁciency. However the design of ﬂat panel photobioreactor along with airﬂow power efﬁciency and blower results in a comparatively higher cost. Acien et al. 60 utilized agricultural fertilizers instead of pure chemicals in the cultivation of microalgae which will lead to reduction in the production cost of biodiesel. Genetic modiﬁcation has also been suggested by Chisti 186 for enhancement of photosynthetic efﬁciency biomass growth rate oil content temperature tolerance to reduce the expense of cooling and to eliminate light saturation phenom- enon reduce photoinhibition occurring in temperate and tropical area that reduces growth rate at midday light intensities and susceptibility to photooxidation that damages cells . Microalgae respond differently to photobioreactors as some algae are more sensitive to shear damage than the others. Some of the algae are also known to grow attached to the internal wall of the photo- bioreactor which prevents the penetration of light in the reactor and thus reduces the biomass productivity. Mutanda et al. 227 states that the quantity as well as quality of the oil and the ester content of the biodiesel derived from microalgae will determine the techno-economic feasibility of the technology. Razon and Tan 228 reported that the energy required for the cultivation of microalgae H. pluvialis and Nannochloropsis and its subsequent drying and cell disruption is a large energy input. Energy saving suggested has been the use of wastewater for culture of micro- algae and recycling of some amount of algal biomass so that the use of photobioreactor which again is cost intensive is eliminated. Das and Obbard 229 studied the potential to reduce the energy supply consumed during mixing and as light imparted during culture of Nannochloropsis. It was projected through a model that by increasing the culture volume 44 of the energy input imparted as constant supply could be saved through the incre- mental energy generated through the mixing of the microalgal culture in a photobioreactor. The cost of conventional removal of nitrogen and phosphorus is reported to be 4.4 kg 1 N and 3.05 kg 1 P removed. Utilizing wastewater as a nutrient source for large scale can thus reduce the cost of wastewater treatment signiﬁcantly. Zamalloa et al. 230 showed that a 70 110 t ha 1 annum 1 facility using wastewater can result in a saving of 48 400 74 800 ha 1 annum 1 for nitrogen removal and 4575 7625 ha 1 annum 1 for phos- phorus removal. The combination of saving from wastewater treatment and reduction of microalgae production costs is thus a win win strategy when used for the production of energy or biofuels 231 . 7.2. Harvesting dewatering and extraction of lipids Kim et al. 231 reported that the production of biodiesel and other products excluding food supplements from microalgae is not economically viable at present. Kim et al. 232 categorizes harvesting and dewatering as the most energy intensive steps and advocates for an efﬁcient and improved method for the same to decrease the cost of microalgal oil production. They further devised an economical method using electro-coagulation coupled with ﬂotation and termed it continuous electrolytic microalgae harvest . For the continuous cultivation and harvest of the micro- algae the technique exchanges the current direction and thus the polarity exchange . Two distinct phases one soluble and the other stable are created during the harvest using a pair of electrodes. The ﬁrst phase comprises of ﬂocs of microalgal cells which are formed by destabilization of negative charged microalgae where metal ions are liberated from the dissolving electrode. In the second phase the metal ions generated from the ﬁrst phase is terminated and bubbles generated from both electrodes renders the ﬂocs to ﬂoat. However other electrochemical reactions may occur during the cultivation and harvesting due to polarity exchange that may cause damage to the cell. To make the oil B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 236 extraction economical and attractive various approaches have been adopted by researchers. Dewatering is considered to account for 20 to 30 of the total cost of biofuels production 233 . Garg et al. 234 investigated the effectiveness of ﬂotation on harvesting of marine microalgae and hydrophobicity of algae as an important parameter in the performance of ﬂotation. A cationic collector tetradecyl trimethylammonium bromide was found to improve the algal hydrophobicity and thus ease in the subsequent harvest- ing of algae. While utilizing Chlorella sp. and Tetraselmis sp. a marine microalga grown in freshwater medium for extraction of oil by ﬂotation without using any collector. It was observed that in six minutes 93 and 6 of the oil was recoverable from former and the latter respectively. This is attributed to the low hydrophobicity of Tetraselmis sp. as compared to Chlorella sp. Rios et al. 235 stated that the harvesting of algal biomass is difﬁcult due to their small size 3 to 30 mm and similarity in density with that of water . The conventional separation methods of microalgae from wastewater include sedimentation ﬂotation with or without ﬂocculation addition centrifugation and ﬁltra- tion. The technology for easier faster and more economical separation methods have been explored recently. Among the other methods membrane ﬁltration offers a technique which does not require addition of chemicals such as coagulants thus allowing the reuse of the nutrient laden water. The biomass can also be used directly to extract lipids. However the technique involves energy input to maintain inter-membrane pressure difference and mem- branes have to be periodically replaced. Other difﬁculties encoun- tered in membrane ﬁltration include fouling due to the difference in shape size and compressibility of organic matter. Electrophor- esis has developed as an important tool through which algae can be separated without use of chemicals. In the method the algae move out of the solution under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld 205 . As harvesting and dewatering contributes a signiﬁcant amount of total biomass production cost. Ahmad et al. 236 used crossﬂow microﬁltration for harvesting Chlorella sp. suspensions mean size diameter of approx. 3.67 mm from the culture medium using a cellulose acetate membrane. Water is allowed to ﬂow tangentially across the membrane in the crossﬂow microﬁltration which allows the microalgal cells to remain in suspension thus limiting the cake formation. Vandamme et al. 237 demonstrated that the pre-concentration of microalgae via ﬂocculation prior to dewatering through centrifugation or ﬁltration can lower the energy needs of the process. However algal organic matter excreted by microalgae interfered with the ﬁve ﬂocculation methods that were tried viz. aluminum sulfate chitosan cationic starch pH induced ﬂocculation and electro-coagulation ﬂoccula- tion demonstrated different dose demands. When magnesium hydroxide was used as a ﬂocculant the dose was lowest two fold while that increased by nine fold when chitosan was used. For the rest of the methods cationic starch pH induced ﬂoccula- tion and electro-coagulation ﬂocculation the dosage increased ﬁve to six folds. Efﬁcient lipid extraction from microalgae involves a solvent extraction assisted with one of the processes viz. microwave sonication or soxhlet. Irrespective of these processes a solvent dimethyl ether chloroform hexane methanol ethanol or the mixture of the two is used. Dimethyl ether is considered to be a safe solvent and is used for extraction in the production of food and food ingredients 78 . Osmotic shock using NaCl has also been used to disrupt the algal cells for lipid extraction. Cho et al. 238 stated that the best way of production of biodiesel is to extract the oil from de-watered microalgae by solvent extraction. However if the cost is a constraint wet extraction of oil from microalgal cell can be done to lower the extraction cost of lipids. Utilizing enzymatic hydrolysis the cell wall of the microalgal sp. C. vulgaris was weakened by hydrolysis at 50 1C and pH 4.8 for 72 h. Hydrolysis of the microalgae by the enzymes cellulases and β- glucosidases led to enhancement of the lipid extraction as com- pared to without hydrolysis with efﬁciency ranging from 29.2 to 73.1 depending on the solvent. The yield of FAAE also increased due to enzymatic hydrolysis varying from 10.1 to 68.9 with the different types of solvent used. Using hexane as solvent the FAME conversion was high but had a lower lipid extraction yield as only the hydrophobic portion was extracted. When chloroform metha- nol was used as a solvent the lipid extraction was enhanced due to extraction of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic content but the FAME conversion was low 67.8 . A high FAME productivity 97.3 was obtained when the dry biomass was used which is the reason for the trend to dewater the algal biomass. 7.3. Low cost catalysts The major cost involved in the synthesis of biodiesel is attributed to the feedstock and enzyme if being used as catalyst . The cost attributed from the feedstock ranges from 70-95 of the total cost of biodiesel 57 . Among the type of catalysts the cost factor at present favors the heterogeneous catalysts as it can be reused with minimal treatment. The enzymes used at present though offers high speciﬁcity and selectivity for conversion of fatty acids to their respective alkyl esters are cost intensive. Whereas the homogeneous catalysts offer low cost for the formation of FAAE. However the residual homogeneous catalyst left in the product has to be puriﬁed by washing with water that generates colossal wastewater and hence limits its applicability at industrial level of production. Various heterogeneous based catalysts along with few homogeneous catalysts with high activity have been reported for the synthesis of biodiesel. Waste derived materials have been extensively utilized as solid catalysts in the production of biodiesel. These includes waste chicken eggshell mollusk Pila globosa clam shell Mereterix mereterix snail shell waste capiz Amusium cristatum and waste ﬁsh Labeo rohita 116 239 244 . The waste chicken eggshell mollusk clam shell snail shell waste capiz comprises of calcium carbonate and their calcination 4860 1C result in the formation of calcium oxide which has high catalytic activity and has been utilized as solid base catalysts. The scales of the ﬁsh L. rohita after calcination resulted in the formation of crystalline structure of β-Ca3 PO4 2. The β-tri- calcium phosphate as solid catalyst resulted in a high yield 97.73 of biodiesel 243 . The utilization of these waste materials as catalyst can lower the cost of biodiesel production and reduce their cost of disposal. These sources prominently comprise of calcium carbonate that upon calcination results in removal of carbon dioxide and formation of calcium oxide 245 246 . Water if present causes saponiﬁcation with alkali catalyst instead of fatty acid alkyl ester i.e. biodiesel . Hence any catalyst tolerant of water is preferred over those catalysts that are less tolerant to water. Few catalysts have been found to be resistant to small amounts of water. The mass production of microalgae is not currently eco- nomically feasible due to its various technological obstacles 247 . The cost if biodiesel derived from microalgae has to be lowered to at least at par with that obtained from the vegetable oil to make it marketable in the fuel industry. 7.4. Emerging extraction and conversion techniques Emerging technologies in the synthesis of biodiesel includes application of microwave membrane technology and ultrasound. Microwave technology has gathered immense signiﬁcance in extraction of oil from microalgal cell and the synthesis of biodiesel at a fast rate. Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with low energy content and belong to the category of non-ionizing radia- tions. These radiations inﬂuence molecular movements ion B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 237 migration or dipole rotations without changing the molecular structure. The polar solvents possessing the characteristics of low molecular weight and high dielectric constant when irradiated by microwave reaches their boiling point in a short time. The solvents that have been used for heating via microwave are water methanol ethanol and acetone 248 . A study by Lee et al. 63 showed that the lipid extraction from microalgae Botryococcus sp. C. vulgaris Scene- desmus sp. was more effective when using microwave in comparison to that from autoclaving bead-beating sonication and osmotic shock. Manco et al. 248 who utilized microwave technology for production of biodiesel found the reaction time to be lowered to just 90 s using carborundum as pebbles. Shuit et al. 249 utilized a membrane reactor for the synthesis of biodiesel. A membrane reactor combines reaction and separation in a single unit thus eliminating the intermediate processing steps. A membrane reactor also enhances the yield and selectivity of reactions. The concept behind the application of a membrane reactor is that when the transmembrane pressure is increased methanol biodiesel glycerol and catalyst will pass through and the unreacted and emulsiﬁed lipids are retained which will continue to react for the formation of biodiesel and glycerol. However there can be certain limitations with the membrane technology as a good amount of methanol is also likely to pass through the membrane and may be a limiting factor in the synthesis process. Lohrey and Kochergin 250 modeled a project for co-location of an industry cane sugar mill and algae production for mutual beneﬁts of both whereby the excess bagasse from sugar mill to be utilized for microalgal cultivation and the algae will utilize nutrients from the wastewater thus a win win scenario that leads to lowered overall production cost of biodiesel. The model projected 5.8 million L production of algal biodiesel per year utilizing the waste resources from cane sugar mill plant. On the estimate of at least 12 excess bagasse coming from the sugar mill the algal farm is estimated to supply the entire fuel requirement through biodiesel for harvesting and transportation of sugarcane. The transesteriﬁcation reaction involves alcohol and oil that are much less miscible and hence stirring is required to overcome mass transfer limitations. Ultrasound is one of the techniques in which the reactants get emulsiﬁed thus reducing the catalyst requirement reaction time and temperature. Another advantage is that the reaction becomes feasible with those feedstocks which otherwise are not conventionally suitable for transesteriﬁcation 251 . Ultrasonic technology thus offers an efﬁcient technique for the production of biodiesel. Using power ultrasound 150 W Ji et al. 252 reported a high yield and a short reaction time 10 20 min for the synthesis of biodiesel with a high yield 100 . High ultrasonic power 150 W resulted in mixing of the reactants oil and methanol in a short time due to better mass transfer rate. However a further increase in the ultrasonic power 200 W reduced the yield of biodiesel. This has been attributed to formation of a mass of bubbles that reduce the methanol content in liquid phase and the interface area between the reactants. The overall reaction rate was found to be dependent on the extent of emulsiﬁcation of the reaction system. Recently Badday 253 utilized a solid acid catalyst activated carbon supported hetero- poly acid for the transesteriﬁcation of jatropha oil. The maximum yield of biodiesel obtained was 91 in 40 min at a high molar ratio of 25 1 at 65 1C. An advantage of using an ultrasonic mode of reaction was the generation of heat during collapse of the cavita- tion bubbles that were formed. The heat generated accounted for low input of external heat maintained at 56 1C for a cumulative heat to maintain the temperature of 65 1C. A major challenge in the economical production of microalgae is as a result of the bioreactors being cost intensive. During the extraction of oil from microalgae a substantial quantity is lost during the extraction process. To overcome these constrains a low cost method has been envisaged by Origin Oil that breaks the cell with a low-power electromagnetic ﬁeld using a process called as quantum fracturing . CO2 is added simultaneously to reduce the pH. The advantages of this method are high efﬁciency of oil extraction in a single step without using chemicals no require- ment of initial dewatering and heavy machinery. The company Origin Oil has further escalated the efﬁciency of oil extraction by 15 using a natural metabolite 51 . Tabernero et al. 51 proposed extraction of oil assuming almost total oil extraction from the cells of microalgae from 5000 m2 of water surface to obtain 10 000 t of biodiesel utilizing lesser number of bioreactors thus lowering the overall production cost of biodiesel. Gerde et al. 254 argued for optimization of the energy that is supplied during sonication to disrupt the cell of Schizochytrium limacinum and C. reinhardtii. As sonication is an efﬁcient technique that does not require any solvent for oil extraction the technique can be considered to be greener than the other techniques solvent extraction . It was found that 800 J of energy per 10 mL of algal wet biomass for 25 min was sufﬁcient for disruption of algal cell. When the sonication time was prolonged free radicals were formed due to oxidation of arachidonic acid present in the oil of the microalgae. Pal and Prakash 255 devised a new methodology of transesteriﬁcation in order to lower the cost of biodiesel from plant based oils. The technique was to disperse the lower amount of oil on alcohol with a small droplet size and the reaction was found to be feasible with low rate of stirring thus lowering the energy input in synthesis process. The gradual dispersion of the oil over alcohol provided a feasibility of high alcohol to oil molar ratio thus enhancing the forward rate of reaction. Jones and Mayﬁeld 40 are of the view that economic biodiesel production could be achieved through combined bioreﬁnery approach where multiple biofuels could be produced from one biomass source. Thus microalgae and cyanobacteria could be used for the synthesis of biodiesel bioethanol biogas and biohydrogen. 7.5. Utilization of by-products As the glycerol obtained after synthesis of biodiesel needs puriﬁcation their utilization for other valuable products has been envisaged by researchers. Chatzifragkou et al. 215 found that the crude glycerol obtained from the synthesis of biodiesel could be used as a carbon source and converted to valuable metabolic products viz. organic acids microbial biomass single cell oil mannitol by using eukaryotic microorganisms yeast and fungi . Nitayavardhana and Khanal 256 utilized glycerol derived from biodiesel to be utilized as an animal feed an edible fungus Rhizopus microspores var. oligosporus through bioconversion. The main advantage of using glycerol as animal feed is a low cost of glycerol that is often discarded due to its energy intensive puriﬁcation methods. Extraction of oil leaves the biomass as left over residues which still possess proteins and carbohydrates that could be further utilized. The residue can also be used as material for adsorption of dyes heavy metals from the wastewater. 7.6. In-situ transesteriﬁcation methods The in-situ methods offer an advantage for merging two steps into one whereby the wet biomass is directly subjected to esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation thus skipping the dewatering and oil extraction step . Bypassing these two steps can minimize the cost by avoiding the use of large quantities of organic solvents and will make the biodiesel production greener 257 . The direct conversion of algal biomass to biodiesel via transesteriﬁcation by using microwave irradiation has been reported by Patil et al. 59 . The use of the microwave technique has shown high conversion efﬁciency of oil in microalgal cells to biodiesel. It has been found to reduce the reaction time and the solvent volume when compared B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 238 with the separate process of lipid extraction and transesteriﬁca- tion commonly adopted. A high power 1400 W microwave was found to cause localized rapid superheating in the algal biomass and resulted in the rupture of cell walls of the microalgae with a high mass transfer rate and thus production of biodiesel. The maximum yield of FAAE obtained was 40.03 at optimized power 1400 W which is quite low as per the minimum speciﬁcations of EN 496.5 wt and hence requires further improvement of the technology 59 . Wahlen et al. 257 demonstrated in-situ trans- esteriﬁcation of pure strains of microalgae C. gracilis cyanobac- teria and wild mixed cultures from wastewater lagoon by a single step comprising of oil extraction for the synthesis of biodiesel and a high FAAE max. 82 was obtained. This was still lower than the EN 14214 speciﬁcations. However the study also demonstrated that water played a crucial role in the yield of FAAE and a high yield of biodiesel approaching 100 has been reported which gradually lowered when the water content was increased with only 50 yield of FAAE at equal content of biomass and water. It was found that adding methanol in higher volume than that required for transesteriﬁcation could offset the potential to reduce costs associated with drying the biomass. Ehimen et al. 258 reported that an increase in the alcohol volume and temperature was necessary to enhance the conversion of microalgal oil to FAAE during in-situ transesteriﬁcation. Thus the additional energy input in the removal of excess alcohol added during the reaction is a constraint and will off-set the advantage of the overall process. Tran et al. 108 compared in-situ transesteriﬁcation of C. vulgaris ESP-31 catalyzed by Burkholderia lipase to conventional transester- iﬁcation of lipids extracted from same species. Wet microalgal biomass was subjected to sonication and then the lipid-containing slurry was mixed with hexane and transesteriﬁed by immobilized lipase. Transesteriﬁcation of wet microalgal biomass showed higher biodiesel yield 97.3 compared to transesteriﬁcation of extracted lipids 72.1 . This approach eliminates drying dewatering and extraction steps from the overall biodiesel production process and moreover gave good conversion and thus has great potential for application at large scale production. Kasim and Harvey 259 used in-situ transesteriﬁcation called reactive extraction using the seeds of J. curcas for production of biodiesel. The particle size of the seeds that showed a high yield of biodiesel production was o0.71 mm. The advantage of using in-situ transesteriﬁcation is that it negates contact of the parent oil with people. This is pertinent as the oil from J. curcas contains phorbol esters that poses health threat to people involved in the oil extraction. The major disadvantage of the process was a high requirement of methanol needed for transesteriﬁcation which on optimization has been reported to be 400 1 methanol to oil molar ratio . The other parameters that inﬂuenced the reaction were in a reasonable limit 30 1C reaction temperature 30 min reaction time and 300 rpm reaction speed utilizing NaOH as catalyst . Su et al. 260 utilized dimethyl carbonate DMC and diethyl carbonate DEC as extraction solvent for oilseeds J. curcas and Pistacia chinensis using the lipase Novozym 435 C. antarctica . The solvents simultaneously worked as transesteriﬁcation reagents for the extracted oil. The methyl and ethyl esters of J. curcas showed a high ester content of 95.9 and 94.5 respectively. A comparatively lower methyl and ethyl esters content of 89.6 and 90.7 respectively were obtained with P. chinensis oilseeds. The solvent to seed ratio of 10 1 was found to give the optimum yield of alkyl esters. The optimum water content in oilseeds for P. chinensis has been reported to be 3.14 and 2.34 for DMC and DEC respectively. While for the J. curcas the optimum water content in oilseeds has been reported to be 3.02 for both the solvents. The end product of the transesteriﬁcation can be grouped into two categories one fraction comprising of organic group and the other comprising of the aqueous group. The former includes fatty acid alkyl esters biodiesel free fatty acids and tri- di- and mono- glycerides. The fraction comprising of the aqueous group are glycerol alcohol and water. Crude glycerol in addition to glycerol comprises of alcohol water soap FAME glycerides FFA and ash. Hu et al. 261 performed a study and found that glycerol along with methanol FAME soap water accounted for 485 of the mass of crude glycerol whereas glycerides FFA and ash accounted for o15 of the total constituent. Jimenez et al. 262 reported that the method of enhancing the oxidation stability of the fuel is to remove the oxygen from the feedstock stearic acid and tristearin and to convert the lipids to hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons have been better fuel properties as compared to biodiesel particularly in terms of oxidation stability cold ﬂow behavior and compatibility in CI engines. The lipids were deoxygenated in a semi-batch autoclave using 20 wt Ni C and 5 wt Pd C as catalyst. 5 wt Pd C showed a better selectivity in the formation of long chain hydrocarbons particularly C17 as compared 20 wt Ni C which has been attributed to high acid strength and presence of acid sites in the latter resulting in adsorp- tion of carbonaceous species on the catalytic surface and cracking reaction. However 20 wt Ni C has been projected as an economical catalyst and other Ni based catalyst have been envisaged. 8. Energy return and greenhouse gas emission from biodiesel The complete replacement of fossil fuels by biofuels does not look feasible at present. However biofuels owing to its lower green house gas emissions through carbon neutrality and other harmful emissions hydrocarbons particulate matter sulfur can lead to a better sustainability by transition from current petroleum based society towards a greener biofuel based society 263 . The main factors that require consideration regarding justiﬁcation of usage biodiesel is its energy return on energy invested EROEI and the beneﬁts in terms of reduced exhaust emissions caused by the fuel. Producers tend to adopt those resources that provide a high EROEI value which fetch more proﬁt 264 . As the current available feedstock for biodiesel i.e. plant based is scanty and the alter- native feedstock i.e. microalgae is in development stages a very high EROEI value is not expected from biodiesel. However their environmental beneﬁts carbon sequestration and reduced toxic emissions may justify their usage as biofuel. Thus energy evalua- tion and assessment of greenhouse gas from the feedstock microalgae and plant based will determine the feasibility of the feedstock for synthesis of biodiesel. Batan et al. 265 proposed an industrial scale engineering model of Nannochloropsis species for its energy evaluation and assessment of greenhouse gases on combustion. Taking in account the energy consumption in terms of nutrients diesel and electricity at various stages viz. algal growth dewatering extraction of oil conversion of oil to biodiesel and transportation and distribution the net energy ratio of biodiesel produced from Nannochloropsis was 0.93 MJ consump- tion per MJ of energy produced. The energy consumption for soybean oil was estimated to be substantially high with 1.64 MJ of energy consumption for production of 1 MJ of energy. The large difference of energy input between microalgae and soybean arose due to high cost value attributed to the soybean oil. Biodiesel developed from microalgae and soybean was found to reduce 75.29 and 71.73 g of CO2-equivalent per MJ of energy produced which may justify the economical and environmental perspective in the usage of microalgae based fuel. 9. Plant seed oil and microalgal oil A complementary to each other as biodiesel feedstock The beneﬁts of the use of biodiesel are enormous. Even as little as a 20 biodiesel blend with mineral diesel i.e. B20 can reduce B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 239 CO2 emissions by 15.7 . At a time when great concern worldwide with regard to the reduction of CO2 emissions the use of biodiesel as fuel seems quite relevant in the present perspective 266 . Doan et al. 75 advocates that the biodiversity of microalgae feedstocks will be important for the production of biodiesel. Biofuels from both terrestrial and microalgae biomass are constantly being upgraded for optimized oil yield and can be complementary to each other in providing a signiﬁcant contribution towards the energy security for the present and near future 267 . Nevertheless there are several more challenges in the utilization of microalgal oil for synthesis of biodiesel than those derived from plant oils. The limitation of plant oils is mainly due to its limited availability and alternative uses. A major challenge with microalgae is the extraction of oil with minimal energy input. Furthermore microalgae are difﬁcult to manage and cannot survive the extreme conditions as several of the biofuels plants do. It has been found that changing the nutrient level does not always alter the composition of microalgae species. Under the condi- tions that can be achieved within the practical limitations the lipid content can vary in the range 20 40 267 . Another major challenge is the harvesting of microalgae. Huge ponds lakes and ocean shores offer a natural habitat for the culture of microalgae. However the invasiveness of microalgae in the natural habitat can alter the course of ecosystem 268 . Temperature is a crucial factor in microalgae cultivation. Most of the species grow in a narrow range of variation in temperature with an upper limit of 35 1C baring a few exceptions. Species that are able to tolerate a high temperature include D. tertiolecta and C. pyrenoidosa having shown a temperature tolerance of 38.9 and 45.8 1C 269 . Grau et al. 270 advocates the use of small scale production of straight vegetable oil instead of large scale production for a self supply of biofuel to farmers. There is no data available on the organic carbon uptake of plant grown for biodiesel from soil. This will not be an issue with algae as they are grown in aquatic environments. Among the prominent plant based feedstocks J. curcas is known to grow under limited nutrient and water conditions. However a wide gap is observed in potential and actual yield of this plant species. This has been attributed to the wild species of J. curcas which is commonly cultivated. This can be overcome by cross-pollination of J. curcas to get a hybrid variety with a high oil content and yield of the seed 64 . Similar to microalgae the oil content and composition in plant seeds or kernels can vary too depending on the soil nutrient conditions and other biotic and abiotic factors. Achten et al. 271 stated that scientiﬁc evidences are yet to establish the claims of low water and nutrient tolerance pest and disease resistance and a high yield of J. curcas. The issues with microalgae and plant species include their water footprint. With microalgae species there is a possibility of uncontrolled spread of algae causing algal blooms. Plant based feedstocks have the major issue of land versus fuel. The other signiﬁcant issues include the organic carbon uptake from soil. Algal bloom is a common phenomenon in the nutrient rich conditions. Microalgae can grow indiscriminately if the nutrient control is not monitored and maintained. Uncontrolled microalgal growth may lead to enhanced productivity of biomass and if grown in ocean may lead to degradation of coral habitat through several factors reduced spatial heterogeneity by over- growth nighttime anoxic conditions . Plant based feedstocks also have safety issues. J. curcas that was considered a wonder plant for application of its seed oil in the synthesis of biodiesel has been found to extract large amount of water from soil a phenomenon similar with Eucalyptus . Though J. curcas can survive in arid and semi-arid environment its oil productivity is hampered when subjected to water stress. Hence the water footprint for J. curcas will be high. Maes et al. 272 reported that J. curcas when subjected to water stress combines C3- CAM photosynthesis in succulent stems and the leaves shifts from C3-metabolism to more water efﬁcient CAM. Johnston and Holloway 273 advocated for the development of biodiesel with a sustainable approach which can be achieved by commercialization of the efﬁcient modes of production of biodiesel feedstocks plants crops grown on marginal land and microalgae grown on aquatic environment so that global supply of the food grains does not get affected. Hence an appropriate crop among the plant based and microalgae based must be selected in that it is sustainable in providing long term availability of feedstock for production of biodiesel. Moringa stenopetala plant oil seed found in Ethiopia has been reported to possess a high oil content of 45 wt comprising primarily of mono-unsaturated fatty acid 78 and saturated fatty acid 22 274 . Oil bearing plants that do not have alternative uses can be diverted for the production of biodiesel. As these sources are well located and there hardly exists any ﬂuctuations in their harvest they can also provide a good source of feedstock for the synthesis of biodiesel. 10. Conclusion The need for a renewable fuel seems to have caught global attention. The prominence of biodiesel in transport sector is attributed to two important factors to meet the escalating demand of liquid fuels and pollution remediation due to combus- tion of biodiesel fuel in either neat form or blend form. Biodiesel being renewable and environment friendly has been envisaged as a future fuel in the transport sector. The major constraint in the commercialization of biodiesel is its high cost as compared to mineral diesel which is contributed primarily by the feedstock. At present plant based oil and microalgae have been projected as potential feedstocks for the production of biodiesel. There is still a long way to go for the plant and microalgal oil to cater the fulﬁllment of enormous amount of fuel demand and qualify to produce biodiesel of desired quality so as to meet the national international speciﬁcations. The progress in research work reported states that though the microalgae can be utilized as a potential feedstock for the synth- esis of biodiesel certain aspects have to be dealt meticulously to make the process more sustainable green and economical. As the lipid proﬁle of microalgae is different from the plant oil the conversion of the former to biodiesel has been found to vary considerably among the microalgal species. The fatty acid consti- tuent also bears a signiﬁcant effect on the fuel properties of biodiesel. In particular the low temperature properties of biodiesel cloud point cold ﬁlter plugging point and pour point have an inverse relation with the oxidation stability of the fuel. The characterization of the microalgal and plant oil is an important parameter which has to be taken in account for the feasibility of the conversion of the contents to FAAE. Contrary to the plant based oils the fatty acid alkyl ester FAAE obtained from the esteriﬁca- tion transesteriﬁcation of microalgal oil derived from several oleaginous species at optimized conditions have not met the speciﬁcation of European Nations EN 14214 which speciﬁes a minimum content of 96.5 . This arises due to the presence of components other than fats and oils in the microalgal oil which are not easily prone to esteriﬁcation transesteriﬁcation. Various methods have been proposed to reduce the cost of production of biodiesel using microalgal and plant oil. A simple and easy way to reduce the cost of biodiesel is by using a low cost feedstock. A blend of the feedstock can be effectively used as it provides desirable constituents for the synthesis of biodiesel. Bioreactors are one of the tools where modiﬁcations have been proposed for maximizing the oil output while cultivating microalgae. Emerging techniques for extraction and conversion using microwave ultrasound in-situ transesteriﬁcation and low cost catalysts can make the biodiesel production process efﬁcient. B. Singh et al. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 29 2014 216 245 240 The integration of biodiesel production with simultaneous pro- duction of methane via anaerobic digestion of glycerol and waste- water obtained from puriﬁcation of crude glycerol can improve the economics and sustainability of process.

A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords Microalgae High-value metabolites Harvesting Cultivation Downstream processing A B S T R A C T Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic organisms capable of producing high-value metabolites like carbo hydrates lipids proteins polyunsaturated fatty acids vitamins pigments and other high-value metabolites. Microalgal biomass gained more interest for the production of nutraceuticals pharmaceuticals therapeutics food supplements feed biofuel bio-fertilizers etc. due to its high lipid and other high-value metabolite content. Microalgal biomass has the potential to convert trapped solar energy to organic materials and potential me tabolites of nutraceutical and industrial interest. They have higher efficiency to fix carbon dioxide CO2 and subsequently convert it into biomass and compounds of potential interest. However to make microalgae a po tential industrial candidate cost-effective cultivation systems and harvesting methods for increasing biomass yield and reducing the cost of downstream processing have become extremely urgent and important. In this review the current development in different microalgal cultivation systems and harvesting methods has been discussed. 1. Introduction Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic organisms capable of converting incident solar energy into chemical energy through photo synthesis Udayan et al. 2017 . Production of microalgal biomass in a controlled environment is considered an emerging technology for the production of high-value metabolites like carbohydrates lipids pro teins vitamins essential fatty acids and minerals for food and nutra ceutical industries Debowski et al. 2020 . Microalgae have several advantages over terrestrial land plants because of their higher efficiency of photosynthesis Patil 2020 higher growth rate ability to cultivate in non-arable lands with lower chances of contamination Dębowski et al.

Microalgae can be also used for phytor emediation wastewater treatment CO2 sequestration which has several environmental applications Stiles et al. 2018 . Efficient microalgal cultivation systems capable of producing rela tively high biomass with high photosynthetic efficiency are gaining more research attention which needs more technological advancement Fu et al. 2019 . Cultivation of microalgae using industrial waste water is found as an effective strategy to reduce cost Yadav Sen 2018 . The majority of the mixotrophic and heterotrophic cultivation studies are limited to laboratory conditions Borowitzka Vonshak 2017 . Serious efforts are needed for the commercialization of microalgal cultivation technology from laboratory conditions to large-scale cultivation systems which need extensive research conceptual operational and marketing works that can successfully release the final product in the market Webster Gardner 2019 . One of the strategies to make the commercialization of microalgae is by achieving high cell density and efficient harvesting methods. Different technologies and instruments have been developed in recent years to improve the cultivation of microalgae. Even though microalgae can cultivate in controlled labo ratory conditions it s very difficult to attain the reproducibility of high productivity on large scale Table 1 Tan et al. 2020 . An efficient cultivation system should have an adequate light source low production cost low chances of contamination simple operation and high land efficiency. However an important criterion for selecting investment decisions is to consider the maturity of innovations for commercializa tion. This process is called technology readiness assessment TRA which must consider the state of work for the development of the product its prospects for further marketing the amount of money for investment and the risks involved in commercialization. High photosynthetic efficiency is the major strength of microalgae- based technologies which is 4 10 when compared with land plants 0.5 2.2 Chen et al. 2015 . This is proportional to the growth rate of microalgae that is a high unit dry matter per yield which is way more than the land plants Sambusiti et al. 2015 . Tredici et al. 2015 designed Green Wall Panel-II photobioreactor and cultivated Tetraselmis suecia with final biomass productivity of 36 tons dry biomass ha 1 year 1 Tredici et al. 2015 . Similarly Chen et al. 2015 and Raslavicius et al. 2014 reported that annual microalgal biomass yields could be range from 4 tons to 100 tons of dry matter per hectare Chen et al. 2015 . If all the growth conditions are appropriate microalgae can double the biomass within hours of the high specific growth rate Bharathiraja et al. 2015 . In 1000 m2 open pond cultivation systems microalgae can produce 500 kg biomass per day Huber et al. 2006 . Another advantage of microalgae is the ability to cultivate in waste substrates which supports maximum biomass production Pyle et al. 2008 and microalgae can be used for the treatment of urban and in dustrial wastewater. Microalgae cultivated in wastewater can release 1.5 1.9 kg O2 kg 1 of the biomass produced using photosynthesis Grobbelaar 2000 . The development of microalgal cultivation and harvesting in a high throughput manner contributed to an active field of research in the past few decades. However despite major advances in the research still more studies are needed to optimize for increased biomass production for industrial applications. It is also necessary to improve the harvesting process which currently accounts for about 30 of total production cost Pandey et al. 2013 . Currently more literature is available on improving the lipid and other high-value metabolite production from microalgae rather than biomass harvesting and dewatering Mathimani Mallick 2018 . An efficient and ideal harvesting method must be suitable for different microalgal species and should attain high biomass recovery with minimal energy and reduced operating cost Chen et al. 2011 . Different techniques such as physical chemical biological and electrical-based harvesting have been used and in some cases two or more methods are combined for maximum biomass recovery from the cultivation medium. In the perspective of biomass harvesting there are numerous studies are available recently. However basic understanding and information on harvesting methods are still not clear. However this review focused to analyze the different harvesting methods and their pros and cons in terms of industrial perspectives. This review also focused on the recent developments in microalgal cultivation for large- scale industrial applications. Table 1 Comparison of different lab scale studies for microalgal cultivation.

Microalgal cultivation modes and systems The cultivation of microalgae required high consumption of water and on average needed 1000 L of water to produce a kilogram of biomass. The most common method of microalgae cultivation is to use an open cultivation system may be ponds tanks etc. or controlled cultivation systems after using various types of bioreactors. The culti vation process generally required acclimatized space with a stable temperature to encourage the activities that are necessary to the cell. Different cultivation modes also can be used for the rearing of micro algae they may be phototrophic heterotrophic mixotrophic and photo-heterotrophic. Table 2 represents the different modes and con ditions for the cultivation of microalgae and the value-added products from microalgae. 2.1. Phototrophic cultivation This is the most ancient way for microalgae cultivation. The main cultivating methods are an open pond system and in closed photo- bioreactor Lodi et al. 2005 Sirohi et al. 2021b . Open pond systems may be in lakes lagoons and ponds or artificial ponds may be con tainers. Submerged aerators can be installed to increase CO2 absorption or microalgae may be satisfied with the surface air Zhan et al. 2017b . The operation is simple under an open pond but too costly in producing biodiesel. On the other hand contamination with other bacteria or algae is very common Lowrey et al. 2016 . Moreover the big temperature difference between day and night creates a problem with the large-scale production of microalgae under an open pond system Khan et al. 2018 . These drawbacks can be overcome using a closed photo biore actor system. The important photo bioreactor used as plate photo bioreactor tubular photo bioreactor and vertical column photo biore actor out of which for large scale cultivation tubular photo bioreactor was found to more suitable Huang et al. 2017 as it has a higher surface to volume ratio. But the cost of the closed system is generally high than the open pond system Acien et al. 2017 . During phototrophic cultivation the organisms acquire energy from the sunlight to synthesize organic compounds for nutrition. The stan dard and directive of incident light are most important in the microalgae cultivation process. The growth characteristics and biochemical composition of the organisms vary with the wavelength spectrum and intensity of light. Generally to carry out various cellular metabolic processes they use the energy from sunlight and CO2 as a source of inorganic carbon to produce chemical energy by photosynthesis Osama et al. 2021 Sirohi et al. 2021a . It has an environmental advantage because atmospheric carbon dioxide is the main contributor to the greenhouse effect moreover the use of microalgal biomass as biofuels Table 2 Modes and cultivation conditions for microalgae and value added products from microalgae.

A. Udayan et al. Bioresource Technology 344 2022 126406 4 results in a beneficial energy balance. Due to this fact phototrophic cultivation is most commonly practiced for the growth of microalgae. The lipid content of microalgae can vary between 5 and 60 during phototrophic cultivation Cruz et al. 2018 depending on the species used. But the intensity of light and proper supply of CO2 should be assured in this type of cultivation. Technically this method is used in the outdoor environment for the cultivation of microalgae generally to in crease the productivity of lipids by supplying 2 5 CO2 in the air and also to use industrial flue gases Yu et al. 2020 . For phototrophic cultivation it is important to select and characterize the strains of microalgae based on their photosynthetic activity growth rate and biomass productivity. The design and construction of cultivation sys tems are very important. Photoperiod also is very important in open cultivation systems as the irregular distribution of light intensity influ ence the biomass concentration Zheng et al. 2012 . Long cultivation periods and self-shading are the major limitations of this method. Mi crobes such as Calothrix sp. Chlorella sp. and green-non sulfur bacteria which utilize light as an energy source for photosynthesis are being used in phototrophic farming to produce pigments and secondary metabolites Amadu et al. 2021 . 2.2. Heterotrophic cultivation Heterotrophic microalgae cultivation was done in the dark making use of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources. It eliminates the requirement of light Mohamed et al. 2011 and nitrogen sources may be organic or inorganic as per the strain used. Therefore the problem related to the limitation of light can be avoided of this method of cultivation and the yield was found significantly superior to photo trophic cultivation Huang et al. 2010 . It also reduces the requirement of the surface-to-volume ratio of the bioreactor thus making the design of the bioreactor easier. It has been reported by Xu et al. 2006 that improvement of 40 lipid content of Chlorella protothecoides after altering the culture from phototrophic to heterotrophic Xu et al. 2006 . Although this mode of cultivation has the advantage of a short period of cultivation indicating high productivity but has a limitation in obtaining high amounts of value-added products and the presence of organic substrates is susceptible to microbial contamination and also may lead to high cost Hempel et al. 2011 . Several strains such as Chlorella vulgaris Chlorella protothecoides Crypthecodinium cohnii and Schizochytrium limacinum can be cultivated under this mode Vuppala dadiyam et al. 2018 . Some species of microalgae cannot grow under phototrophic conditions required some organic carbon in the absence of light. Light limitation problem is avoided with heterotrophic cultivation and has resulted in useful microalgal biomass production. Due to the more cell density harvesting cost generally decreases in this system of cultivation Iasimone et al. 2020 . The heterotrophic culture can also be combined with plant fermentation technology and facilities that reduce the production cost Venkata Mohan et al. 2015 . In heterotrophic culture important carbon source is glucose although some researchers use the cellulose hydrolysis product El-Sheekh et al. 2012 . Some algae can also grow well in presence of glycerol as a carbon source which can preserve the cell osmotic balance and is not harmful in high concen trations. These researchers also informed that some microalgae could multiply with composite carbon sources Kong et al. 2021 . Some of them combined microalgae cultivation with factory effluent and use factory wastewater to reduce the cost. Dramatic cost can be reduced after using factory sewage which is reached in nutrients. Many micro algae may be grown in carbon-rich sewage under alternating light or dark conditions or in the wastewater with the introduction of organic nutrients from outside Zhan et al. 2017a . For example Chlorella pro tothecoides cultured with waste-activated sludge hydrolysate might potentially grow well and produce lipid Cho Park 2018 . Overall heterotrophic culture may hasten cell growth rate more biomass and lipid accumulation compared to phototrophic culture and may be blended with wastewater treatment to reduce the cost. 2.3. Mixotrophic cultivation In this process of cultivation carbon dioxide and organic carbons are simultaneously comprehended by microalgae and both chemo heterotrophic and photoautotrophic metabolism go on concurrently. Microalgae growing under this environment can survive in both pho totrophic as well as heterotrophic conditions Mansa et al. 2018 . This type of cultivation is the two-stage mode where the first stage can be related to heterotrophy because of more content of initial organic car bon. After evacuating the organic carbon at a certain level photosyn thesis was persuading therefore the algae undertake to assimilate CO2 photoautotrophically that indicating the beginning of the second stage. The disadvantages of the autotrophy system can be controlled in a mixotrophic system and it has combined the advantages of autotrophy and heterotrophy. Zhan et al. 2017 communicated that the cell growth rate of Chlorella vulgaris was just about the total of autotrophy and heterotrophy when cultured under mixotrophic mode with light and acetate as carbon source Zhan et al. 2017a . In this cultivating condi tion microalgae can not only spread heterotrophically with organic carbon but also swallow inorganic carbon and turn out oxygen through photosynthesis that put together the overall CO2 emission lower under mixotrophic cultivation mode than under heterotrophic cultivation mode. The mixotrophic cultivation is different from heterotrophy as the precious pigments and photosynthetic carotenoids for example β-carotene could be protected in illuminated conditions even though the energy conversion efficiency is lower under mixotrophic cultivation due to photosynthetic losses Alkhamis Qin 2016 . In general the characteristics of photosynthesis are different under mixotrophic cultivation than autotrophy and heterotrophy Sirohi et al. 2021b . The respiration rate is enhanced in mixotrophic cultivation as compared to the autotrophic condition. The net photosynthetic rate and respiratory rates were found almost 1.5 times higher. Moreover the photosynthetic pigment content and photosystem activity also differ under mixotrophic conditions. However the change in photosynthetic pigments was dependent on the species of microalgae and the organic carbon source Benavente-Valdes et al. 2016 . 2.4. Photoheterotrophic cultivation Microalgae growing under this condition require light and they use organic compounds as a source of carbon. The main difference with the mixotrophic cultivation is in mixotrophic cultivation light and organic and inorganic carbon source is used as a source of energy while under photoheterotrophic systems light is used for energy fix fixation of ni trogen and organic matter as a carbon source without CO2 Chen et al 2011 . Although photo-heterotrophic culture requires organic carbon and light it is rarely employed to generate microalgal biomass for the production of value-added products. 3. Systems of microalgal cultivation An open system is widely used for the production of microalgae in the industry due to the economy for large-scale production. Normally an open pond is used with a very simple design. Normally ground tanks with depth up to 0.5 m and a paddle agitator are used for stirring. The concern culture media is usually chemical substances or biogenic com pounds and when necessary microelements may be supplemented. At mospheric air is used through a simple diffusion process for carbon dioxide. The major advantage of an open system is simple and inex pensive but it has high water losses due to evaporation lower biomass yield and susceptibility to contamination. The system is only victorious with strict isolation and unlimited access to water. In respect of eco nomic terms this type of system is the most reasonable choice. Many closed systems have been developed so far but none of them are cost- effective. Table 3 exhibits the merits and demerits of a different sys tem of cultivation of microalgae. A. Udayan et al. Bioresource Technology 344 2022 126406 5 3.1. Open ponds Open ponds are considered the oldest and simplest method for the large-scale cultivation of microalgae. It is widely used in the industry because of its low maintenance cheaper construction low energy de mand easily scale up and low operational costs Tan et al. 2020 . Natural lakes and ponds are considered open ponds and artificial water bodies like circular and raceway ponds are also constructed for indus trial applications. However despite the large cultivation area the major disadvantages of open ponds are low cell concentration and difficulty in the harvesting process. Moreover problems such as rainwater runoff will affect the growth of microalgae by changing conditions such as salinity and pH along with the turbidity caused by the erosion of river banks Stark O Gara 2012 . The major drawback of the open pond systems is the contamination by bacteria and protozoa which makes the end product to be toxic and unstable. Because of the open nature of the cultivation system it is very difficult to control temperature and light intensity which primarily affects the growth rate of microalgae Ugwu Aoyagi 2012 . The first artificial pond used for the large-scale cultivation of microalgae is circular ponds and the name came from the circular shape of the culture tank. The tank has a dimension of 30 70 cm depth and 45 m width with a rotating agitator placed at the center of the tank. An agitator is used to provide proper mixing and prevention of sedimen tation of microalgal cells Costa et al. 2019 . The designing of open pond cultivation systems is limited because the large size will exhibit strong water resistance which creates more strain on the agitator Moreno-Garcia et al. 2017 . Currently worldwide more than 70 companies cultivate Chlorella in open pond systems with the largest producers located in Taiwan Tan et al. 2020 . Raceway pond is another type of open pond system used for the in dustrial cultivation of microalgae which is mainly composed of a series of the closed-loop channel of 30 cm depth and a mechanical paddle wheel which helps in the circulation of microalgal biomass for uniform distribution of nutrients and prevention of cell sedimentation Tan et al. 2020 . Raceway ponds have been considered as the best open pond cultivation system because of their energy efficiency Rogers et al. 2014 . Columbus Algal Biomass Farm located in the United States suc cessfully produces 520 metric tons of dried microalgal biomass during 2 years of operation without any technical problems White Ryan 2015 . Table 4 shows the companies involved in commercial microalgal biomass production using different reactors. 3.2. Photobioreactors Photobioreactors are used for the culture of phototrophs in a closed system which does not permit the direct exchange of materials between the cells and environment Tan et al. 2020 and is effectively capable of overcoming several disadvantages of open pond systems. Photo bioreactors do not need large space because of the compact design in comparison with open ponds and photobioreactors provide highly controlled growth conditions for microalgal culture and reduce the chances of contamination by maintaining an axenic culture of micro algae Posten 2009 . The controlled growth environment can result in higher metabolic efficiency and biomass production per unit substrate Tan et al. 2020 . However photobioreactors consist of many design problems because the practical usage is very limited and it is uneco nomical in industrial perspectives Gupta et al. 2015 . The design of photobioreactors consists of high capital and operational costs. Different types of photobioreactors are available in the market based on their design and mode of operation. Tubular photobioreactors are made up of long transparent glass or plastic tubes that are arranged in vertical horizontal helix or slanted positions for maximum sunlight capture Mishra et al. 2019 . An Airlift system or mechanical pump is given for the circulation of microalgae within the photobioreactor. Poor mass transfer efficiency because of the presence of long tubes is the major disadvantage of tubular photobioreactors which can cause dif ferences in the substrate concentration and product yield. Large-scale tubular photobioreactors are widely used in Germany and Israel for the commercial cultivation of Haematococcus and Chlorella Torzillo Chini Zittelli 2015 . Vertical column photobioreactors consist of a transparent vertical cylinder tube and a sparger. The sparger allows the homogenization of the microalgal culture and uniform distribution of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the cells Mohan et al. 2019 . Vertical column photo bioreactors have a good gas liquid mass transfer in comparison with other systems because of the smaller bubbles created by the sparger Mohan et al. 2019 . Moreover the simple construction parameters result in easier operating procedures and low energy demand. But the major disadvantage of the system is the low light capture due to the cylindrical shape which reduces the photosynthetic efficiency of microalgal cells. Another disadvantage is the construction cost and cleaning difficulty in large-scale operations Huang et al. 2017 . 40 L capacity vertical column photobioreactor has been used for the culti vation of Chlorella zofingiensis in China Huo et al. 2018 Flat plate photobioreactors are made up of rectangular-shaped compartments with a depth of 1 5 cm using transparent material and mixing is provided through an airlift system Tan et al. 2020 . Flat late photobioreactors provide maximum capture of light with a low buildup of oxygen which provides the highest photosynthetic efficiency in comparison with other photobioreactors Yan et al. 2016 . The major disadvantage of the flat plate photobioreactor is the stress damage of the cells due to the design provided for aeration. Efforts were made to improve the working efficiency of flat plate photobioreactors by devel oping twin layers a flat-plate and plastic photobioreactors Vo et al. Table 3 Merits and demerits of commonly used algae cultivation systems Modified from Dibowski et al. 2012 . Cultivation System Type Merits Demerits Open Systems Round ponds racetrack type ponds Relatively economical easy to use and clean good for large scale production Difficult to control culture conditions difficulty for long term use low productivity cultivation susceptible to predators disease and external factors Photobioreactors column High mass transfer good mixing less stress and low energy consumption more stable guarantee sterility potential for scalability reduce photoinhibition and photooxidation Exposure in limited area sophisticated material is required for construction hydrodynamic stress is possible surface exposure is deceased with increase in diameter Closed systems Photobioreactors plate More surface area exposure suitable for outdoor culture better for the immobilization of algae more availability of light good productivity relatively cheap easy to clean low concentration of oxygen Requires the use of multiple chambers and supporting structures to control the culture temperature is difficult risk of fouling the walls hydrodynamic stress is possible Horizontal tubular photobioreactors Large surface area exposure suitable for outdoor culture good productivity relatively cheap Fluctuations in pH dissolved oxygen CO2 in pipe length the risk of fouling the walls requires a large surface A. Udayan et al. Bioresource Technology 344 2022 126406 6 2019 . Astaxanthin was produced commercially from microalgae by a company located in Czech Republic using flat plate photobioreactor. 4. Harvesting techniques For the commercialization of microalgal products it is very impor tant to harvest the microalgal biomass effectively in a low-cost manner. The effectiveness of microalgal harvesting mainly depends on achieving high biomass production with low operation cost maintenance and energy. Most of the harvesting stages are costly followed by downstream processing. The selection of specific harvesting methods will mainly depend on the end products and should consider the cell size and den sity cell damage salt concentration and moisture content. During harvesting it is important to avoid the chances of contamination and the possibility of culture medium recycling should also be taken into consideration. The currently available methods are based on chemical biological mechanical and electrical technologies Fig. 1 . For low-cost biomass harvesting methods combination of two or more methods can be employed. The significant downstream processing carrying the combined effects of flocculation followed by sedimentation with centrifugation could be employed to minimize the cost of processing. Biological methods are also considered as a low-cost method because of the low operational cost along with different mechanical processes. Different methods used for microalgal biomass harvesting have been discussed below. 4.1. Centrifugation Centrifugation is a rapid process used at both laboratory and com mercial scales to separate biomass from suspension. It is also efficient for dewatering microalgae-thickened biomass Najjar Abu-Shamleh 2020 .The forces in the act during the process may cause cell damage the intensity of which depends upon the strain and operating conditions Singh Patidar 2018 . The recovery rate of this process is more than 95 and it can be used for any microalgae species for achieving a 10 20 concentration of the recovered solids Fuad et al. 2018 . Industrially it is a preferred harvesting method however being quite energy-intensive it adds considerably to the process and operational expenses and hence is mostly used for bioactive compounds like phar maceuticals Hidayah Mat Yasin et al. 2019 . Energy consumption of about 50 75 kW is required for the recovery of 12 25 biomass by centrifugation Najjar Abu-Shamleh 2020 . Fixed wall e.g. hydrocyclone and rotary wall e.g. centrifugal de canters disc centrifuges and tubular centrifuges are the two types of systems that are used for centrifugation Mathimani Mallick 2018 . The hydrocyclone is cylindrical equipment where the input microalgae culture is fed at the top from an angle and the cells move downward through the vessel in a cyclonic motion larger and denser particles dragging towards the bottom outlet. Decanter centrifuges are horizontal conical tubes that rotate at high speed and create separation based on differences in the specific weight of particles. The biomass moves to the sides further collected through a helical thread Najjar Abu-Shamleh 2020 . The disc centrifuge consists of a vertical stack of thin conical metal discs in which the culture is poured at the core of the stacked cylinder. The rotation of the cylinder causes the biomass to move out wards and then to the bottom whereas the culture liquid moves to the center. Tubular centrifuge lacks a draining system and is generally used in laboratory studies. Table 5 shows the comparison of different types of centrifuges used for the harvesting of microalgae As already mentioned centrifugation is efficient for high-value products such as pharmaceuticals and it is not cost-effective for low- value products which can be processed in an integrated system like biofuels from microalgae. Centrifugation is an energy-intensive process which is the major disadvantage for efficient biofuel production for large-scale applications Wang et al. 2015a . Moreover the initial in vestment of centrifuge is very high which makes the process cost high Monte et al. 2018 Okoro et al. 2019 . It has been reported that the investment cost of centrifuge can reach up to 30 of the cost and the increased capital cost can be problematic for large-scale applications Alam et al. 2017 together with the cost of labor Fasaei et al. 2018 . Therefore automation is indeed necessary to reduce the labor cost which needs more intensive research. Moreover the high maintenance cost and service charges of centrifuge equipment are the major barriers that prevent the expansion of centrifugation technology for large-scale industrial applications of microalgae. Centrifugation is not practically feasible to operate in saline environments Najjar Abu-Shamleh 2020 . In addition the requirement of high strength and corrosion- free alloys for the construction of centrifuge makes it more expensive. The other factor critical for centrifugation is the destruction of the microalgal structure due to the shear stresses and gravitational forces Morais Junior et al. 2020 which depends on the cell wall structure and type of microalgae used. Studies were conducted to examine the toler ance of certain microalgae to shear stress and high cell damage was Table 4 Companies involved in the commercial microalgal biomass production using different reactors.

Therefore finding the optimum rotational speed specific to each microalgae is very important to keep the cells of microalgae intact Michels et al. 2016 . 4.2. Flocculation Flocculation is an effective process for biomass recovery in which the microalgae cells are flocculated by some organic inorganic flocculants or bio flocculants or by altering the pH of the system Fig. 2 Matter et al. 2019 . Flocculation is the process of aggregation of smaller par ticles to form large flocs with the assistance of flocculating agents Branyikova et al. 2018 . The flocs are then decanted over time. Inor ganic flocculants include chemicals such as aluminum sulfate or ferrous sulfate Branyikova et al. 2018 . Such inorganic flocculants are effective but they are expensive and their high dose application can adversely impact the quality of final products a limitation considered particularly when the product is to be used for food and feed. Flocculation results in biomass recoveries as high as 100 although the product quality is impacted by inorganic and organic flocculants as their used concentra tion can range between 50 and 600 mg L Laamanen et al. 2016 . Organic flocculants like starch and chitosan display efficient recovery rates at relatively lower concentrations with lesser adverse impacts on the environment and microalgae biomass Lee et al. 2015 . Removal of excessive flocculants from the medium requires an additional separation process to decrease the negative effects on biomass and products. The use of magnetic nanoparticles is an emerging technology being inves tigated for optimizing the flocculation process Wells et al. 2017 . Microalgae flocculation mechanisms in general are similar to those used for water treatment plants Pugazhendhi et al. 2019 . The use of inorganic metal salts for microalgae recovery is possible but not pref erable since the recovered biomass reportedly consists of a high con centration of metals from the salts which even after lipid and carotenoids extraction remains in the biomass residue Matter et al. 2019 . Alkali such as NaOH is often used to adjust the pH of the system which further enhances the activity of flocculants Ummalyma et al. 2017 . The combination of flocculation with other conventional recov ery methods like sedimentation or filtration increases the overall re covery efficiency. The microalgae lipid content besides pH is also influenced by the species and culture parameters. While considering the effect of pH alkalization to pH 10 improves flocculation and after efficient flocs are formed the pH is re-shifted to 8 by washing the cells with an ammonium format solution. Inorganic salts can be removed by this isotonic solution with the maintenance of both cells and lipid content Liu et al. 2013 . Bio flocculation utilizes the flocculating potential of microorganisms like bacteria without the need for chemical flocculants. Microalgal bio flocculation with the help of microbes requires additional substrate for bacterial growth Nguyen et al. 2019 . Exopolymeric substances released by microbes are also used for flocculation Yang et al. 2020 . Auto flocculation is an economically feasible process in terms of energy and process cost. In this process microalgae cells flocculate at high pH more than 9 in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ Ummalyma et al. 2017 . The process is induced by CO2. The addition of alkali usually 1 M NaOH solution can also induce auto flocculation achieving more than 90 recovery efficiencies Singh Patidar 2018 . The pH of the cultivation media becomes basic as microalgae utilize CO2 from the media during photosynthesis. This high pH in turn neutralizes the negative charges present on the surface of microalgae cells causing them to flocculate Okoro et al. 2019 . The addition of NaOH however is not preferred industrially as it alters cell composition and process control becomes tedious. 4.3. Sedimentation Sedimentation is a simple economic and energy-efficient recovery process that uses gravity for cell separation Fasaei et al. 2018 . The process is energy efficient as energy consumption of less than 0.1 kWh m 3 can result in 1 to 3 final solid concentration Leite et al. 2020 . The sedimentation rate is affected by the size and density of particles such that particles with small density or size differences sedi ment very slow Mennaa et al. 2019 . In such cases the addition of flocculants is done to increase the recovery efficiency up to 90 due to the electrostatic attraction caused among the suspended cells floc for mation with the assistance of charged flocculants Fuad et al. 2018 .

Different flocculation methods used for the separation of microalgae. A. Udayan et al. Bioresource Technology 344 2022 126406 8 In comparison with different types of sedimentation processes sedimentation of microalgae using high pH 9 12 using a low-cost base such as NaOH is considered more effective. The inorganic salt will co- precipitate and interact with negatively charged microalgal cells by the principle of neutralization during alkaline conditions which facili tate the sedimentation process of microalgae Lei et al. 2018 Leite et al. 2020 . The effect of high pH on microalgae cultivation has been widely studied by many researchers Mathimani Mallick 2018 Morais Junior et al. 2020 Singh Patidar 2018 Ummalyma et al. 2017 . But the harvesting of microalgae cultivated in wastewater needs more research in large-scale cultivation systems because the compounds present in wastewater can be hindered with the sedimentation efficiency Leite et al. 2020 Mennaa et al. 2019 . However more research is needed to understand the optimum parameters affecting sedimentation under alkaline conditions. The available studies only focused on ex periments performed in beakers stirred with a specific velocity using stirring equipment. But these results cannot be reproduced in large volumes of microalgal culture because the sedimentation rates can be changed depending upon the equipment and the culture volume Leite et al. 2020 . Thus more critical research is needed to enable the scale-up process. 4.4. Filtration Filtration is a solid liquid separation technique when a suspension is passed through a membrane the solid retains while the liquid passes through filter pores Mo et al. 2015 . This causes collection of micro algae biomass even low-density microalgae over the membrane which can be further recovered. Filtration can be performed either through dead-end flow or through tangential flow. Ultrafiltration micro filtration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis fall under tangential flow or cross-flow systems Castro-Munoz Garcia-Depraect 2021 . The different membranes used for separation vary in their pore sizes as microfiltration membranes have a pore size between 0.1 and 10 µm ultrafiltration between 0.01 and 0.1 µm and nanofiltration membrane between 0.01 and 0.001 μm Roy 2019 . Microalgae cells greater than 70 μm in diameter are suitable to be recovered by dead-end filtrations while smaller cells are recovered by tangential flow filtration. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes are better at recovering microalgae biomass Diaz-Montes Castro- Munoz 2019 . However these membranes are energy-intensive as they require high pressure to promote flow across them owing to their smaller pore sizes Bilad et al. 2014 . Ultrafiltration at low pressure consumes 3 10 kWh 3 energy giving 15 to 60 L m2 ha of permeate fluxes Castro-Munoz Garcia-Depraect 2021 . Moreover filtration membranes also suffer from fouling which is a condition in which membrane pores clog by solids due to continuous use over time. Mem brane fouling hinders the smooth operation of the filtration membrane increasing the operating costs as well as process time. To reduce clog ging and improve process efficiency filtration is usually performed after other recovery methods like coagulation and flocculation. Tangential flow filtration systems are simple and efficient and can operate contin uously for the separation of biomass Zhao et al. 2017 . The perfor mance of each filtration method depends upon membrane pore size membrane material size of particles to be retained and pressure requirement Das et al. 2019 . 4.5. Magnetic separation In this process the separation is based on tagging a non magnetic substance like cells with magnetic particles that show paramagnetic movement with the help of a magnetic field. The cells are therefore isolated from the medium in an external magnetic field Rakesh et al. 2020 . The binding between cells and magnetic particles can be enhanced by coating with silica or cationic polyelectrolyte resulting in better aggregation of the cells. This method is the most widely accepted modern microalgal biomass harvesting method in terms of simple cost- effective and energy-efficient properties Wang et al. 2014 . Different types of magnetic nanocomposites were developed and efficiently used for harvesting microalgal biomass given in Table6. For efficient large-scale harvesting of microalgae using magnetic nanoparticles a systematic separation system is indeed necessary. The high gradient magnetic separation system HGMS has been used in industries in the past decades Hu et al. 2014b . The development of high gradient magnetic fields of 104 T m efficiently provides energy to harvest magnetic from the solution and it is commonly used by many industries Hu et al. 2014a . But large-scale industrial magnetic sepa rators are not suitable for the separation of microalgal cells because of the specific properties and cell wall characteristics of microalgae which is different from the industrial process Wang et al. 2015b . Hu et al. 2014 developed a magnetic separator that can be used to effectively harvest microalgae Hu et al. 2014a . However the industrial separa tion of microalgae using these methods is very costly. The total har vesting cost of microalgae from fishpond was US 0.13 cubic meter of treated pond water. Large-scale harvesting of microalgal biomass using magnetic separation is very costly therefore it is indeed necessary to decrease the cost of the process. More research on the downstream processes following the magnetic separation including the extraction of the specific products and the reusability of magnetic particles are necessary to make the separation process more efficient. 4.6. Dissolved air flotation Dissolved air flotation DAF is inverted sedimentation or a variation of flotation in which the liquid medium is sparged with air or gas bub bles generated at high pressure such that the solid particles attach to them and move towards the liquid surface from where they are recov ered Torres et al. 2017 . This method is often aided by flocculation Table 6 Application of magnetic nanoparticle for the separation of different microalgae. Microalgal species Magnetic nanoparticle used Separation efficiency References Chlorella sp. Magnetic iron oxide coated amino rich polyamidoamine pH 8 greater than95 Chu et al. 2020 Chlorella vulgaris Phaeodactylum tricornutum Nannochloropsis salina Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Silica coated magnetic nanoparticles pH 8 12 greater than90 Fraga- García et al. 2018 Botryococcus braunii Chlorella ellipoidea Cationic polyacrylamide coated iron oxide greater than95 Fraga- García et al. 2018 Nannochloropsis oceanica Uncoated iron oxide pH 8 99 Chu et al. 2020 Chlorella vulgaris Iron oxide magnetic microparticles 95 Savvidou et al. 2021 Chlorella ellipsoidea Iron oxide nanoparticles pH 7 greater than98 Wittmann et al. 2021 Chlorella sp Diallyldimethylammonium chloride with iron oxide nanoparticle 99 Wang et al. 2014 Nannochloropsis sp Silica coated magnetic particles pH 8 less than40 Cerff et al. 2012 Chlorella vulgaris DEAE magnetic beads pH 4 90 Wang et al. 2015b Chlorella sp. Chitosan magnetic nanoparticle 97 Toh et al. 2014 A. Udayan et al. Bioresource Technology 344 2022 126406 9 which causes aggregation of particles and increases the process yields Zhang et al. 2016 . In case DAF is performed after flocculation some water is recycled and saturated with pressurized air. The rate of recir culation determines the number of bubbles generated 5 15 at 400 650 kPa Torres et al. 2017 . Recovery of some microalgae species like Scenedesmus quadriculata Tetraselmis sp. and Chlorella sp. has been investigated by DAF with estimated energy consumption around 7.6 kWh m-3and final solids concentration between 3 and 6 Zhu et al. 2018 . Use of an air injector and a high-speed stirrer or continuous air flow through a porous material cause bubble formation in DAF which subsequently interacts with charged surfaces of cells and attract them to the surface Torres et al. 2017 . This process is simple to operate in little space and time and shows the capacity to treat large volumes of microalgae cultures which makes DAF an effective process for micro algae recovery Fasaei et al. 2018 . Even though DAF has been studied for microalgae harvesting its large-scale use is hindered by the energy costs associated with the requirement of high pressure. The selection of a harvesting process is often hindered by the costs associated with energy consumption e.g. high recoveries are achieved by filtration and centrifugation at a large scale but the use is limited by high energy requirements. The energy cost also depends upon the product economics. The combined use of two or more methods can be an effective approach to diminish energy limitations Fasaei et al. 2018 . The selection of an appropriate harvesting method besides process economy also depends upon the final product. The use of chemical substances and metals in the process like flocculation and magnetic separation often alters the product and biomass characteristics. Hence given a biorefinery it is necessary to select a method that reduces the chances of product and cell contamination even if it suffers from a little higher energy expenditure. 4.7. Electrochemical technologies The traditional coagulation flocculation methods cause the charge neutralization or formation of networks because of the pH change or treatment with polyvalent metal ions. Electrochemical technologies for microalgal biomass harvesting are a new approach that is mainly based on the concept of electrocoagulation electroflocculation and electro floatation. Electrochemical technologies are considered as a cheap innovative and efficient method for biomass harvesting from micro algae in comparison with other methods which need complex opera tional parameters and costly chemicals Misra et al. 2014 . Electrocoagulation EC involves the generation of metal ions because of the oxidizing metal electrodes which create the destabiliza tion of colloid suspension and subsequent coagulation of microalgal biomass Hattab 2015 . In this process either direct current DC or low-frequency alternating current AC can be used which causes the oxidation of the anode and subsequent electrocoagulation process. The major concern of EC is the electrode depletion which requires periodic replacement which can be replaced with suitable inexpensive material like non sacrificial carbon electrodes Guldhe et al. 2015 . Another disadvantage of this process is the contamination of harvested micro algae due to metal depletion of the electrode which affects the cost- efficiency. To avoid market value depreciation dewatering methods that do not involve trace metals can be used. Electrochemical technologies have demonstrated the high potential and efficiency of microalgal biomass harvesting. Electrolytic floccula tion for 1 h has resulted in 85 95 microalgal biomass recovery with a current supply of 5 V Hattab 2015 . Similarly electrolytic floccu lation for 3 min in Dunaliella salina cultures has shown 97.4 biomass recovery efficiency Zenouzi et al. 2013 . In electrofloatation bubbles generated by the electrolysis of water are used to attach the microalgal cells in suspension and raise them to the surface of the reactor Geada et al. 2018 . Cathode used in this method will be created using an inert material that is electrochemically nondegradable which overcomes the problems of contamination and electrode replacement Geada et al. 2018 . The combination of electrocoagulation and floatation ECF is considered an efficient alternative to traditional microalgal harvesting methods because of its simple mode of operation and ability for scaling up Geada et al. 2018 . In this process sacrificial electrode generates coagulating ions which are capable of destabilizing microalgal cells and these cells aggregate and create flocs that can be trapped by the microbubbles produced as a result of electrofloatation Gao et al. 2010 . Several researchers have investigated the application of ECF for har vesting microalgae from drinking or wastewater Alfafara et al. 2002 Azarian et al. 2012 Gao et al. 2010 but additional studies are required for more efficient harvesting. ECF can also be used as a continuous microalgal cultivation and harvesting method Kim et al. 2012 . In this process one electrode is considered as sacrificial and the other one is a non-sacrificial electrode and continuous microalgae harvesting is ach ieved by polarity exchange Kim et al. 2012 . Operation of ECF depends on different factors such as current density electrode material tem perature pH heavy metals etc. Hattab 2015 The electrophoresis technique can also use for the harvesting of microalgae where no additional chemicals are required. In this process a suitable electric field is applied and as a result the dispersed particles will move relative to a fluid. The microalgal cultivation media is rich in monovalent sodium and potassium ions and the negative charge of microalgae created will move the cells towards anode when subjected to a direct current electric field Uduman et al. 2010 . In the anode compartment negatively charged algae lose charge results in the agglomeration and floc formation Uduman et al. 2010 . Metal ion contamination during the process can be solved by using the non- sacrificial electrode. Dielectrophoresis can also be used for harvesting microalgal cells where a mixture of two or more microalgae species with different electric conductivities or dielectric properties Geada et al. 2018 . Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells were harvested using dielec trophoresis using alternating current with minimum cell damage Sus cillon et al. 2013 . C. vulgaris cells were also harvested using the dielectrophoresis technique Deng et al. 2013 . However future research is needed to establish efficient electrochemical technologies for the harvesting of microalgal cells with minimum contamination and low cost. 5. Post-harvest processing Post-harvest processes include drying of the biomass to remove re sidual moisture content. Various methods are used for drying including solar spray drying freeze-drying cross flow and vacuum-shelf drying Babar et al. 2020 . Drying can increase biomass shelf life and ease the extraction of lipid or other substances. A particular method is selected based on the final moisture content desired and the properties of the product. Most of the drying methods can minimize the water content to 4 from 55 to 90 which is the moisture content range of wet biomass Show et al. 2015 . Energy consumption operational costs and air temperature are similar in convective spray and rotary drying pro cesses. Energy consumption ranges between 5 and 6 kWh kg while the air temperature depends upon the final product usually ranging be tween 50 and 120 C Show et al. 2015 . Solar drying requires low cost and low energy investment however the outcome heavily depends upon sun availability and drying time. Freeze drying on the contrary is extremely energy-intensive and consumes 22 kWh kg biomass Show et al. 2015 . The high energy expense could be attributed to the low pressure and temperature treatment that is provided to cells during this process ensuring biomass preservation without cell disruption. Microalgae-based biorefineries showcase the immense potential for the efficient utilization of microalgae as a source of bioenergy and biomaterials. Many biorefineries utilize microalgae biomass cultivated by wastewater thus also promoting microalgae-based bioremediation. Depending upon the cultivation conditions pretreatment and process ing methods the biomass and associated bioactive compounds can be A. Udayan et al. Bioresource Technology 344 2022 126406 10 used for the manufacturing of high-value metabolites. These include biofuels and bioenergy like biodiesel bioethanol biogas hydrochar etc. and bioactive metabolites like nutraceuticals pigments antioxi dants etc. 6. Challenges associated with mass culturing of microalgae and future perspectives Culturing of microalgae at a large scale for lipids nutraceuticals bioenergy production etc. suffers from some major challenges. For successful product recovery from microalgae achieving higher growth and biomass production are indeed necessary. But mass cultivation of microalgae often results in decreased growth biomass production and end-product formation. Phototrophic cultivation of microalgae is ad vantageous due to the possibility of its establishment in the open where CO2 is obtained from the environment and nutrients from aquatic hab itats however regions that receive varying sunlight with fluctuating intensity are not suitable to establish such a cultivation system limiting its utilization. The primary challenge is the availability of light when the cultures are specifically phototrophic as the extent of light penetration into the cultivation system might hinder the productivity Biondi et al. 2017 . As a result of low light penetration photobioreactors might show low biomass concentration thus affecting both microalgae cultivation as well as harvesting costs. Penetration of light and therefore photosyn thesis are also hindered in cases where biomass concentration increases in photobioreactors. This occurs due to mutual shading caused among cells particularly cells of the top layer shade the cells beneath creating a dark zone with very little or no light penetration. This could result in the concentration of biomass as low as 2 4 g L which can be reportedly increased if the optical path of the culture is shortened Cuaresma et al. 2009 . Moreover costs associated with downstream processes are affected by the dilute nature of autotrophic cultures and the inability to optimize simultaneous recovery of the different microalgal components Klok et al. 2013 . Both the open and closed cultivation systems have their respective benefits and drawbacks. Open systems possess greater economic feasibility but chances of contamination are high Moreno García et al. 2017 . In contrary closed systems give proper control over process parameters like temperature pH etc. But initial setup cost is high and the system is also inhibited by poor control of light supply. Conventional closed bioreactor systems flat plate stirred tank etc. being used for microalgal cultivation Kumar et al. 2011 display poor light to biomass conversion. Besides reduction in the optical path high surface area to volume ratio and flash light effect or photoperiod also increase the penetration of light and absorption in the photobioreactors Xue et al. 2013 .In the case of culture systems involving light dark cycle L D cycle the precise control of the illumination frequency is compromised in cases where the cultivation systems require mixing. This is because the mixing causes random motion of microalgae cells which in turn results in fluctuation in the amount of light dark fre quency reaching each cell. Moreover the microalgae cultivation system with mixing possesses certain drawbacks. Such systems cause cell damage due to the high shear force that comes into the act through turbulent mixing of cells and also the mixing devices employed increase the usage of energy and price Liao et al. 2014 . Heterotrophic and mixotrophic microalgae cultures are better suited for cultivation in closed systems as they can grow in low light or even dark conditions with higher productivities. However in such cases the culture is often supplemented with organic carbon substrates due to the unavailability of environmental CO2 thus increasing the production costs. Glucose is the preferred source of carbon in growth media but in mixotrophic cultures high initial glucose concentration adversely impacts lipid accumulation in cells Cheirsilp Torpee 2012 . Contrarily another study showed that exhaustion of glucose along with phosphate depletion under mixotrophic conditions ceased the culture growth after four days Kumar et al. 2014 . Another drawback in the mass culturing of microalgae is the need for huge amounts of water and nutrients which makes the process economically less feasible Tan et al. 2021 . The high water content of microalgae culture more than 98 leads to poor accumulative properties of cells which as a result do not coagulate and create difficulty in cell harvesting Chen et al. 2011 . The light electrons captured by the microalgal photosystem are used as energy for the generation of organic compounds while remaining electrons get involved in catabolic reactions or are dissipated Janssen et al. 2019 . Imbalances in metabolic pathways due to nutrient depletion can either obstruct the growth process or alter the electron flux leading to a decline in the biomass concentration. Efficient large-scale microalgae cultiva tion thus requires enough supply of water and nutrients along with control on the feed-stock related costs. This all together creates one of the major challenges for commercial-scale cultivation. Water reuse re duces the need for water and nutrients to 84 and 55 respectively Yang et al. 2011 . But it should be noted that before reuse of the harvested water with nutrients in it the water should be treated to remove soluble algal products metabolites released by microalgal cells during cultivation as the presence of these metabolites in reused su pernatant reportedly restrains the growth of subsequent microalgal cells Zhang et al. 2013 . Microalgae cultivation can also be obstructed because of the considerable culture pH shifts caused due to absorption of all dissolved CO2 by the cells during day and its release during night Ying et al. 2015 . Moreover excess O2 accumulation during day can also lead to photo oxidation and cell death. The utilization of wastewater for microalgae cultivation has also been suggested as a way to ease out excess water usage. However before use for microalgal cultivation wastewater is needed to be supplemented with nutrients and pre-treated to remove other microbes which if remain can compete with microalgae for nutrients. Pretreatment by autoclaving and filtration have been performed for microbial removal among which autoclaving might disrupt the nutrient load of wastewater too and particulates are not completely removed by autoclaving which can obstruct light utilization by microalgal cells during photosynthesis Ramsundar et al. 2017 . Moreover such additional pretreatments cause an unnecessary increase in energy consumption time system complexity and overall process costs. The level of nitrogen and the stage of growth are the main parame ters deciding the route of microalgal metabolism and so the depletion of nitrogen at the early or late stage of culture is reported unfavorable for microalgae growth and increase in biomass. Even though most lipid accumulation is favored by late depletion of nitrogen Gifuni et al. 2018 different classes of lipids accumulate under different light and nitrogen conditions. Considering the overall molecules involved in microalgal metabolism high metabolite accumulation happens in the late stationary phase or nitrogen depleted conditions Gifuni et al. 2018 . 7. Conclusions Techno-economic considerations are the key roadblocks in the commercialization of microalgae-based products because of high initial investment for cultivation and harvesting. However combating the challenges during each step would substantially reduce the cost of product development from microalgae. This review gives insights on the comprehensive outlook of existing harvesting methods for microalgal biomass recovery also the various methods and their challenges with an emphasis on the cost factor. Requirement of high energy and more time are the major challenges associated with physical methods to dewater more volume of microalgal culture which points out the need for an effective harvesting technique.

The high productivity the significant lipid concentrations of microalgae and their ability to grow in adverse environments make them very attractive as feedstocks for biofuels. In this review the authors discuss microalgae potentials as third-generation biofuels which include the different cultivation systems culture modes alimentation modes and harvesting technologies for microalgal biomass production before biofuel generation. A comprehensive literature review is conducted to identify relevant studies on microalgae by taking several academic databases to ensure a broad coverage of the literature and focusing on the studies of the last decade to ensure that the review includes the most recent advancements and trends in the field. The extracted data were then analysed to identify common trends innovations and gaps in the current research. The findings reveal that microalgae attain a lipid content of almost 10 40 a yield capacity of 58.7 136.9 kl ha and a heating value of 32.73 41.0 MJ kg. The combination of multiple harvesting methods effectively increases the capacity compared to when used individually as shown by both an increased harvest rate and a reduction in energy consumption. Additionally pre-treatment methods including mechanical thermal and enzymatic approaches optimize the conversion of microalgal biomass into various biofuels. Despite these advancements the transition from laboratory to commercial scale faces challenges including strain selection seasonal variations and cost-effective pre-treatment processes. The commercialization of microalgae-based biofuels will lead to a sustainable and low-carbon future with potential applications extending to food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Future research should focus on optimizing cultivation conditions harvesting methods and pre-treatment techniques to enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of microalgal biofuel production.

These fossil fuels provide about 95 of the world s energy needs. Ardebili Khademalrasoul 2018 . Emissions of harmful greenhouse gases and pollutants such as particulate matter carbon monoxide unburnt hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides pollute the environment and endanger human life. However if emissions are not reduced carbon dioxide levels which are currently at about 420 ppmv parts per million volume are predicted to reach 500 ppmv by 2050 Caspeta et al. 2013 Gür Science 2022 . Fossil fuel depletion and its harmful climatic implications encourage the search for alternative fuels. Many nations have recognized the necessity of biofuel and are preparing to produce it and combine it with current transportation fuels in order to minimize their reliance on fossil fuels. As developing countries produce a large volume of organic waste they are considered as a primary raw source for biofuel production Khan et al. 2022 . Microalgae have become a promising option for producing biofuels in the current search for sustainable energy sources thanks to their abundant lipid content and fast growth rates. Studies have found that incorporating a mixture of up to 20 is advantageous without any modifications or alterations to fuel engines Lahane Subramanian 2015 Rajpoot et al. 2024a . The global concerns about climate change and energy security have triggered the urgent need for renewable energy solutions and viable and sustainable alternatives. Feasibly microalgae have a number of benefits over their conventional oil crop counterparts such as higher lipid production per unit land area and the ability to grow in a variety of environments including on infertile land or wastewater. The potential is to reduce probably millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions and significantly reduce the need for fossil fuels Rajpoot et al. 2024b . Fossil fuels and biofuels come from extinct organisms and are also used to power generators cars and other devices in addition to producing heat and energy. Since fossil fuels and biofuels release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere their continued use has a negative impact on the environment. Although fossil fuels and biofuels share many characteristics Table 1 also identifies some important distinctions. Microalgae microscopic photosynthetic organisms have gained attention for their potential to produce biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol. Compared to terrestrial plants used for biofuels microalgae yield substantially higher amounts of lipids per unit area and time making them more efficient and sustainable. Different generations of biofuels have been developed over the last two decades for biofuel production Rajpoot et al. 2023a . There are currently four generations of biofuels produced from different sources first- second- third- and fourth-generation biofuels. Table 2 shows the four generations of biofuels. Research is presently being conducted on the third and fourth generations of biofuels. Solar fuels electro fuels biomass from marine algae and other genetically modified raw materials will be used to produce fourth-generation biofuels Moravvej et al. 2019 . Third- generation biofuels are produced from microalgal biomass. Edible and non-edible biomass are used to make the biofuels of the first and second generations respectively. The use of food crops for biofuel production which has an impact on human food sources is the main drawback of first-generation biofuels. However farming land is needed for second-genera- tion biofuels which puts food crops and their resources in competition. There are very few usable first- and second-generation biofuels due to their negative environmental effects. A. S. Rajpoot et al.

The objective of the present review article is to comprehensively examine the current state-of-the-art in microalgae. A brief introduction and novel comparison have been made among various parameters and recent developments associated with microalgae including different cultivation and harvesting methods operating conditions pre-treatment methods with their current feasibility status advantages challenges etc. The review aims to highlight the advantages and limitations of various methodologies identify key research gaps and challenges and propose future directions for advancing the commercial viability and sustainability of microalgae-derived biofuels. The study s specific objectives include To identify and evaluate the effective microalgae strains for biofuel production. To analyse and compare different cultivation systems and their efficiencies. To assess innovative harvesting and pre-treatment methods that can reduce costs and energy usage. To explore the potential for integrating microalgae biofuel production with other technologies and industries. To provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental and economic viability of microalgae-based biofuels. 2.1.1 Methodology of the review The present study was conducted in a systematic and structured manner to ensure a full overview of the literature on microalgae-based biofuel generation. The methodology aimed to select the relevant studies. A thorough search of peer-reviewed journal articles confer- ence proceedings and reports was undertaken utilizing databases such as PubMed Scopus and Web of Science. The search was constrained to papers between 2010 and 2024 focus- ing on key terms such as cultivation and harvesting of microalgae biomass for biofuels microalgae conversion processes microalgae biofuels biofuel production technolo- gies renewable energy biomass pre-treatment etc. Studies covering biofuel produc- tion strategies problems or technological advancements were included. Excluded mate- rials involved studies focusing on unrelated elements of microalgae such as their use in food or pharmaceuticals. Relevant data from the selected research was extracted including information on biofuel production processes procedures problems and current advance- ments. Special emphasis was devoted to emerging trends and their potential scalability for industrial applications. A comparison analysis was undertaken to analyze the efficiency performance and economic feasibility of several biofuel production systems. The assess- ment also critically analyzed the limitations of the processes and technologies mentioned A. S. Rajpoot et al. including potential environmental implications and difficulty in scaling up production. Current barriers faced by the sector such as energy efficiency cost and sustainability were analyzed. Based on the findings gaps in the current literature were identified and relevant future study directions were noted. Emphasis was placed on overcoming existing hurdles and investigating technologies that could make biofuel production from microalgae more viable and sustainable. The methodology of the review is represented in the process flow chart of Fig. 1. 3 Microalgae growth and metabolism Various feedstocks have been researched and tested for their use as biofuels. Table 3 shows some of the potential bio feedstocks from the three generations of biofuels with their respective characteristics which shows how microalgae fit into the picture as the top priority for the production of biofuels. Using microalgae biofuel is advantageous in that it may be produced at any time of year on any land that is suitable or unsuitable for farming. As a result microalgae have a higher oil yield than any other crop and have no environmental impact. For example microalgae can be used for wastewater treatment carbon capturing reducing water salinity etc. Daneshvar et al. 2022 Su 2021 . Also microalgae cultivation does not require any extra chemical compounds for its growth. It has the ability to grow quickly with an oil content of 20 60 . Compared to other bio feedstocks microalgae exhibits an oil extraction efficiency of over 91 Deshmukh et al. 2019 . Since microalgae produce more energy per hectare than other feedstocks they contribute to a reduction in the amount of land used. Microalgae generally consist of 7 23 lipids 4 57 carbohydrates and 6 71 proteins depending on the species culture metabolisms and techniques used Praja- pati et al. 2013 . The main component of microalgae that are used to produce biofuels is lipid. For growth microalgae need carbon dioxide water sunlight and a few other nutrients like phosphorus potassium and nitrogen Yaakob et al. 2021 .

The process known as the Calvin-Benson cycle fixes inorganic CO2 into 3-carbon molecules called glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or G3P which are then absorbed into lipids starch sugars or other molecules necessary for the development of cells Beer et al. 2009 . During photosynthesis glucose is produced which is then used to make lipids proteins and carbohydrates Okoro et al. 2019a . Table 4 displays the variables that influence the microalgae development. In their natural state microalgae are either heterotrophic autotrophic or mixotrophic. They can grow in both freshwater and saltwater and they can have one or more cells. An estimated 80 000 species are believed to exist on Earth of which about 40 000 have been identified and studied Khan et al. 2018 . The microbes are able to multiply more quickly because of their greater surface-to-volume ratio. Microalgae cells are typically tiny with sizes ranging from a few micrometres to several meters such as giant kelp Zhu et al. 2018 . The surface of microalgae cells is negatively charged Huang et al. 2020 . Because of their ease of suspension in the medium microalgae cells are kept from aggregating. The by-products of microalgae cultivation include animal feed protein food supplements biofuels bioethanol biodiesel bio-oil and bio-hydrogen and more. Furthermore biodegradable plastic can be made from the polysaccharides found in algae Rajpoot et al. 2022 . Table 5 displays the lipid content and lipid productivity of some microalgae species that are either widely used or have the potential to be a competitive substitute for the manufacture of biofuel.

To meet the commercial demand some systems need to be developed. Two primary methods for microalgal cultivation systems for biofuel production are open systems and closed systems Ananthi et al. 2021b . Relative to a closed system the cost of producing microalgae is lower in an open system because it Table 5 Different microalgae strains with their lipid contents and lipid productivity Microalgae Lipid content Lipid productivity mg L day References Chaetoceros calcitrans 39.8 17.6 Rodolfi et al. 2009 Chaetoceros muelleri 33.6 21.8 Rodolfi et al. 2009 Chlamydomonas debaryana 45.33 87.5 Arora et al. 2016 Chlamydomonas sp. 18.4 Wu et al. 2012 Chlorella protothecoides 33.4 28.8 Ryu et al. 2014 Chlorella sorokiniana 19.3 44.7 Riaño et al. 2016 Chlorella sp. 18.7 53 17.2 42.1 Cho et al. 2017 Jia et al. 2014 Chlorella vulgaris 18.4 34.2 23.3 36.9 Gumbi et al. 2017 Yang et al. 2016 Chlorococcum sp. 19.3 53.7 Rodolfi et al. 2009 Coelastrella sp. 24.8 Luo et al. 2016 Desmococcus olivaceous 16 S.

S. Rajpoot et al. is simpler to construct and maintain. Highly effective systems for treating wastewater are open systems like tanks scrubbers raceway ponds etc. The development of microalgae farming is however often hampered by a number of issues including easy contamination insufficient use of light the requirement for vast areas of land water evaporation pond collapse and a lack of control over growth parameters. Table 6 shows the requirements for open and closed microalgae cultivation systems. 4.1.1 Open pond system Open ponds have built-in raceways or circular configurations. Open raceway ponds are the most widely used microalgae cultivation technology. Although previously plastic-covered earth-lined ponds were also utilized they are typically constructed of concrete. Compared to photobioreactors they are less costly to build and run. To provide better sunlight and achieve a high growth rate of microalgae cells the race- way pond system Fig. 2a is constructed to be of the horizontal shallow raceway type around 20 to 30 cm deep separated by vertical partitions in a multiple-loop configuration Paul et al. 2021 . It contains a specially constructed paddlewheel for mixing the biomass and recirculating it around the loop. It contains baffles as well to direct the flow and pre- vent sedimentation during the cultivation cycle. For shallow open ponds enough sunlight penetration is required Raeisossadati et al. 2019 . The circular pond Fig. 2b is an addi- tional kind of open pond system where the culture is mixed and moved by a central pivot spinning agitator Lee et al. 2018 . The cell suspension circulates at a speed of 0.2 0.5 m s inside the channels which are normally coated with an inert plastic layer and propelled by rotary blades propellers or pumps. The machine collects the cells extracts the suspension periodically and returns the additional liquid to the pond. Utilizing non-arable and marginal land is one of the main advantages of the open sys- tem. Compared to photobioreactors open systems require less energy and maintenance. Raceway ponds have the ability to produce more net energy than photobioreactors since their overall energy input is lower Rodolfi et al. 2009 . Currently open systems raceway type or open circular ponds tanks account for around 95 of microalgae production. The rate of CO2 fixation in these systems is limited to 20 50 by microalgae due to which these systems cannot be considered as an effective CO2 bio-fixation method. Another Table 6 Requirements of open and closed microalgae cultivation Xiaogang et al. 2020 Requirements factors Open system Closed system Space High Low to medium Mixing Poor Uniform Water Very high Low Microalgae cell density Low High Energy demand Low High Oxygen Low High Carbon dioxide High Low Initial cost High Very high Productivity Low High Harvesting cost High Low Operation cost Low High Contamination risk Very high Low to medium Exploring the potential and progress of microalgae biomass limitation of open pond systems is low productivity. In open systems productivity is directly impacted by unpredictable seasonal factors Paul et al. 2021 . In open ponds envi- ronmental conditions are largely uncontrollable. Low productivity in open ponds is attrib- uted to various factors such as light restriction caused by culture density and CO2 transfer rate. The rapid contamination of open-pond systems by undesirable species further restricts the system s wider application. As a result a few species are grown in open ponds. Some of these species include Chlorella Daniella salina Spirulina etc. Kumar et al. 2021 . 4.1.2 Closed systems The culture of microalgal species is done in closed systems called photobioreactors PBRs which use closed tubular reactors and artificial light. Reduced light route and increased light intensity are the basic operating principles of the majority of photobioreactors. This system maintains the ideal conditions for the growth of a particular microalgae strain while preventing contamination of the microalgae culture. They re typically employed for high- value products that can t be grown in open systems. Gaseous exchange inside the system requires mixing Ananthi et al. 2021b . In this system mechanical stirring and pumping or airlift mixing are frequently employed. Mixing is useful in phototrophic systems because it makes simultaneous mixing and aeration possible. Because they use different combinations of light sources to increase photoperiod and enhance low light intensities brought on by solar variation photobioreactors are more adaptable. Artificial light has the potential to increase microalgal biomass productivity by maintaining photoperiod and light intensity Lau et al. 2022 . Optical cell density which can be used to accurately estimate the dry weight of biomass is a characteristic of the growth rate of microalgae in PBRs Busnel et al. 2021 . The best photobioreactors for large-scale culturing are tubular ones Fig. 3a . Tubu- lar PBR is typically constructed using straight glass or plastic tubes arranged in helical vertical slanted or horizontal configurations. Solar collectors are typically composed of plastic glass with a diameter ranging from 10 to 60 mm which allows light to permeate Fig. 2 Cultivation systems used for microalgae cultivation a open raceway ponds b open circular ponds A. S. Rajpoot et al. dense cultures Zuccaro et al. 2020 . Usually a degasser is employed which periodically extracts extra oxygen from the culture. High oxygen levels lead to decreased productiv- ity due to photooxidative stress. In order to create mixing inside the reactor turbulence is used. Another type of reactor that has dominated microalgae production in the last decade is the flat-panel PBR reactor Fig. 3b . To maximize the amount of sunlight captured it is shaped like a cube and composed of translucent or semi-transparent materials including plastic bags glass plexiglass and polycarbonate. Flat plate photobioreactors achieve high cell densities due to their large surface areas which help in capturing sunlight. The dense microalgae cultures are fed through flat panels SundarRajan et al. 2019 . Flat-plate reactors are preferred for large-scale cultivation due to their high photosynthetic efficiency but they have high mixing and installation costs Suparmaniam et al. 2019 . Photobioreactors enable the length of the light path to be optimized resulting in enhanced biomass productivity and preventing contamination of the atmosphere Lau Fig. 3 Cultivation systems used for microalgae cultivation a closed tubular bioreactor b closed flat- plate bioreactors Exploring the potential and progress of microalgae biomass et al. 2022 . Long tube lengths lead to excessive oxygen accumulation CO2 depletion and pH variations. The productivity of biomass is negatively impacted by each of these conditions. When compared to open systems photobioreactors are thought to be a useful tool for overcoming contamination and low production Arutselvan et al. 2022 . The primary disadvantage of numerous photobioreactors is their elevated energy usage. Artificial lighting raises electricity consumption and capital expenses Nwoba et al. 2019 . It has been suggested that light-emitting diodes be used instead of fluorescent lights because they are more affordable. Energy can be saved by lighting interior culturing system components with optical fibers exposed to the sun. The benefits and limitations of open and closed microalgal cultivation techniques are displayed in Table 7. 4.2 Microalgal cultivation modes The technique known as the microalgae cultivation method refers to a way of setting up a system that will encourage or boost the growth of both new and existing microalgae cells. For microalgal cultivation systems there are three different kinds of modes of operation batch semicontinuous and continuous. Batch culture is a well-established technology that allows microalgae to be cultivated in a variety of freshwater and marine habitats Iglesias et al. 2019 . Because of nutrient absorption batch cultures are unable to maintain stable nutrient levels which leads to lower biomass output Sutherland et al. 2020 . Several studies have shown that biofuel may be produced by continuously or semi- continuously cultivating microalgae Peter et al. 2022a . Biomass is periodically harvested in semicontinuous culture by adding fresh culture medium El Ouaer et al. 2020 . In contrast nutrients are continuously separated and the nutritional medium is provided at the same time when microalgae are produced continuously Solmaz et al. 2020 . The continuous culture method minimizes downtime because the established cell withdrawal will be replaced simultaneously with a new medium input. Continuously growing microalgae have a better possibility of being used to manufacture biofuel on a pilot scale Cheirsilp Torpee 2012 . Table 8 contrasts the benefits and drawbacks of batch semicontinuous and continuous modes. When algal growth in batch and semicontinuous cultures was compared semicontinuous cultures outperformed batch cultures Huo et al. 2020 . Significant disadvantages of semicontinuous and continuous modes include high starting costs and unstable functioning over the long run. Consequently the development of a culture mode appropriate for the majority of microalgae species with high growth rates and productivity is necessary. 4.3 Microalgal alimentation modes Diverse species of microalgae have different modes of metabolism Fig. 4 such as auto- trophs heterotrophs and mixotrophs Ray et al. 2022 . 4.3.1 Autotrophic cultivation Through photosynthesis microalgae in autotrophic culture directly convert inorganic car- bon into organic matter. As a result of their shared ability to be photosynthetic that is to absorb light energy and use CO2 for growth and cultivation microalgae species most frequently use the autotrophic cultivation mode of metabolism. By employing solar light to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and gas from industrial waste this cultivation method A. S. Rajpoot et al. Table 7 Benefits and limitations of open and closed cultivation systems Harvesting methods Culture area ha Productivity gm- 2 day 1 Benefits Limitations References Open system 0.2 4 12 30 Easy construction and operation Low cost and energy consumption Widely used for food supplements cultivation Low light density Evaporative losses Large space requirement Easy contamination Climatic dependency Poor gas exchange Costa et al. 2019 Closed system 1 10 16 18 Controlled growing conditions Low water and CO2 losses Low dependence on climatic conditions High biomass densities Very low contamination Higher biomass productivity High capital and operation costs Fouling of the surface Limitation of light penetration Overheating Low biomass yielding capacity Razzak et al. 2023 Exploring the potential and progress of microalgae biomass Table 8 Advantages and limitations of different microalgae cultivation modes Microalgal cultivation modes Advantages Limitations References Batch Easily to set up and operate Low risk of contamination Effective nutrient removal rate Unable to maintain constant nutrient levels Low biomass productivity by volume Limitation to one cultivation cycle only Sonkar et al. 2020 Semicontinuous High biomass productivity Stable conditions Wastewater treatment capacity is high High investment and operation cost Can be contaminated easily Long-term operational performance stability is uncertain Zhuang et al. 2023 Continuous system Easy to regulate and maintain growth rates for long period of time Controlled biomass concentration Easy and reliable results Greater possibilities for system research and analysis Wash-out due to wall growth and cell aggregation Gradual loss of the original product strain Increase in the contamination risk due to long-term growth Requirement of high-quality equipment Peter et al. 2022b A. S. Rajpoot et al. for microalgae can somewhat reduce pollution. Consequently this technique of microalgae cultivation is economical and ecologically benign. In phototrophic culture microalgae can accumulate lipids from 5 to 68 depending on the strain Ananthi et al. 2021b . The concentration of microalgal lipids rises in more nitrogen-limited environments Yuan et al. 2019 . When cultivated in a photoautotrophic environment Chlorella sp. has the maximum lipid content weighing 0.179 g L d Cheirsilp Torpee 2012 . Cultivating microalgae close to power businesses that emit large amounts of CO2 is preferred since it lowers global CO2 emissions through autotrophic growth. Because there is less chance of contamination photoautotrophic microalgal cultivation can be carried out outdoors in raceway ponds and open ponds on a large scale. Due to the low biomass concentration in these settings the main problem in this technique is the high expense of microalgae culture Verma et al. 2020 . For the photoautotrophic mode to be used commercially for an extended length of time significant research and funding are needed. 4.3.2 Heterotrophic cultivation Heterotrophic culture is the process of growing microalgae without sunlight. It is the method via which organic carbon is used to fuel microalgal growth in the absence of light energy. With the exception of the addition of organic carbon heterotrophic cultivation is comparable to autotrophic cultivation. Chlorella protothecoides and other microalgae were able to transition from phototrophic to heterotrophic growth and attain a forty percent increase in lipid content Ananthi et al. 2021b . For the development of microalgae the most prevalent organic carbon sources are glucose lactose fructose galactose sucrose and glycerol. This technique s primary disadvantage is that it requires organic carbon sources which increases the risk of contamination Oliveira et al. 2021 . Moreover using organic molecules as a source of carbon and energy raises the cost of cultivation considerably. In photoautotrophic mode microalgae convert CO2 into organic compounds by utilizing sunlight to break down an inorganic carbon source while in heterotrophic mode microalgae rely on the metabolism of organic substances present to supply a carbon source and energy. Higher lipid Fig. 4 Autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic metabolisms in microalgae cultivation Exploring the potential and progress of microalgae biomass content microalgae are developed by heterotrophic culture. These microalgae are more prone to contamination though particularly in systems of open production. Although photoautotrophic farming produces less lipid it is more environmentally benign Chew et al. 2018 . Microalgal cultivation in a heterotrophic mode is more advantageous than in a photoautotrophic mode because microalgae can develop in dark environments which means that their surface-to-volume ratio needs are substantially lower than those of the photoautotrophic mode and hence increased cell mass is obtained due to the higher energy density of the given carbon source than CO2 in the photoheterotrophic mode Hu et al. 2018 . 4.3.3 Mixotrophic cultivation Microalgae grown in a mixotrophic environment obtain their energy from both light and organic matter and their carbon from CO2 and organic carbon. This enables the algae to carry out photosynthesis and take up organic nutrients from the environment. Mixotrophic processes involve both autotrophic and heterotrophic systems. Both the respiratory and photosynthetic metabolisms are active during mixotrophic growth which involves the simultaneous absorption of CO2 and organic carbon Pang et al. 2019 . For this mode a closed bioreactor with a light source is utilized because using organic chemicals will contaminate. More lipid and biomass are produced by mixotrophic microalgae cultivation than by heterotrophic microalgae culture Cheng et al. 2022 . The needs benefits and drawbacks of microalgal culture in various cultivation modalities are listed in Tables 9 and 10 which presents a comparative analysis of the biomass concentration carbohydrate content and fat content of different metabolisms. 5 Microalgae harvesting Using a range of downstream techniques harvesting is an essential process that extracts algal biomass from the algal growing culture. The small size and colloidal stability of microalgal cells make the extraction of microalgal biomass a difficult and costly process. The kind of biomass recovery is determined by the density of the biomass slurry. Tech- niques for harvesting biomass include gravity sedimentation filtering centrifugation and others. Various techniques for capturing microalgal biomass are displayed in Fig. 5. 5.1 Thickening methods 5.1.1 Gravity sedimentation The process of gravity sedimentation involves allowing a concentrated microalgae slurry to settle and separating the denser microalgae cells from the clear liquid called supernatant Nie et al. 2018 . Larger and denser cells descend more quickly than smaller ones with size and density having a major influence on the rate of settling Fig. 6a . When the end product like biofuel has a low market value gravity sedimentation is the best method for harvesting microalgae because it is highly effective for a wide range of microalgae species and notably energy-efficient. Stokes law explains the principles governing the sedimenta- tion rate. It establishes a relationship between the settling velocity and the size density A. S. Rajpoot et al.

The gravity sedimentation equation is given by Toh et al. 2018 where μ is the fluid s dynamic viscosity ρm is the microalgae cell density g is the gravita- tional acceleration and r is the microalgae cell radius. Gravity sedimentation gives 1.5 solids concentrations however the varying density of microalgae cells constrains it to be either less precise or undependable. The time and speed of sedimentation are functions of cytoplasmic density and therefore gravity sedimentation efficiency Ahmad et al. 2022 . Microalgae are often settled by gravity sedimentation following a coagulation or flocculation process. Some research asserts that gravity sedimentation is unable to capture low-mass microalgae units and a small part of biomass is killed during the settling process Enamala et al. 2018a . The gravity sedimentation method uses less energy and is more cost-effective. However dependability is questionable because of the restricted production of slurry and the requirement for further thickening. 5.1.2 Flotation Flotation has been seen as a promising method for the harvesting of microalgae due to its effectiveness and advantages compared with conventional sedimentation methods. In this method bubbles of gas are attached to cells of the microalgae which serves to increase their buoyancy and promote separation from the culture medium. Flocculants or surfactants are added to the microalgae suspension a beading process in which flocs would form quickly and with large size. The flotation process is initiated by introducing pressurized air or nitrogen at the bottom of a tank full of wastewater or sludge. Air bubbles form and attach to flocs that elevate them to the surface where they are collected and further separated Xu et al. 2021 . A study by Hell and Liebminger 2024 discussed three types of flotation ozonation dispersed flotation ODF electrolytic flotation and dissolved air flotation DAF . Flotation offers several advantages including low space requirements quick operating times high flexibility and the need for costly but energy-efficient equipment. 횟 2gr2 휌m 휌 9휇 Fig. 5 Thickening and dewatering methods of harvesting microalgae A. S. Rajpoot et al. Electrolytic flotation uses a higher amount of energy than dissolved air flotation DAF . A common technique for treating wastewater is dissolved air flotation DAF Palaniandy et al. 2017 . Particle stability in suspension determines flotation harvesting efficiency. Reduced instability is correlated with higher levels of airborne particle interaction. Using ozone gas injection a technique known as ozonation-dispersed flotation ODF helps cells float to the surface by producing charged bubbles Mathimani Mallick 2018 . But Fig. 6 Microalgae biomass harvesting by a gravity sedimentation b electrophoretic separation c chemi- cal method d bio-flocculation method e magnetic separation and f filtration method Exploring the potential and progress of microalgae biomass the ODF method isn t practical for widespread use due to its high cost and potential for contamination. Ballasted flotation and electrocoagulation-flotation are two recent examples of novel techniques. The process of ballasted flotation involves binding microalgae cells with low-density materials so they rise to the surface and are separated Xu et al. 2021 . Electrolysis of water releases metal cations from the anode creating flocculation agents that produce microbubbles that help lift algal flocs to the top and facilitate effective harvesting without the use of additional chemicals Mathimani Mallick 2018 . 5.1.3 Flocculation methods In flocculation the large solid clusters or flocs are removed spontaneously or with the help of external agents using electrical chemical bio-flocculation or magnetic methods. The electric method uses electrophoretic separation to collect the microalgae cells using an electric field. Proteins and other macromolecules are often separated using this technique. Larger particles stay stationary during electrophoresis allowing smaller particles to move through the column s pores Corrêa et al. 2020 . The negative charge on the surface of microalgae allows them to concentrate when an electric field is applied Fig. 6b . In electrolytic or electrophoresis processes a sacrificial cathode and a non-reactive anode are utilized. Negatively charged microalgae cells are drawn to a positively charged anode by electrophoretic motion. A metal hydroxide is created when the anode s metal ions react with water as a result of electrolytic oxidation. Algal cells neutralize the positively charged surface of these hydroxides causing flocculation recovery Kumar et al. 2022 . When the flocculation efficiency of various metal and alloy electrodes was assessed at various voltages it was found that in comparison to other electrodes the magnesium Mg electrode exhibited the highest efficiency and the brass electrode the lowest. Moreover Fig. 6 continued A. S. Rajpoot et al. all electrode materials flocculated the least at low voltage and the most at high voltage Phiri et al. 2021 . Low current density leads to less power consumption per kilogram of microalgae harvested even though high current density accelerates flocculation for microalgae harvesting. The chemical flocculation involves adding a chemical coagulant to the water to make larger easier-to-separate aggregates. Chemical flocculation is induced by organic and inorganic polymers that are attached to the microalgae surface through electrostatic force. Microalgae negatively charged cellular surfaces interact with various organic and inorganic flocculants to produce considerably larger flocs Fig. 6c . These larger flocs are then settled by gravity. There are three types of organic flocculants cationic anionic and non-ionic. Because they attract negatively charged microalgal cells cationic flocculants are considered to be the most efficient flocculants for harvesting algal biomass. Cationic organic polymers reduce microalgal cell electronegativity. Chitosan flocculant is a high molecular weight synthetic polymer. Chitosan flocculation has been demonstrated to be successful for cell harvesting from microalgae species including Chlorella vulgaris and Chaetoceros muelleri with an efficacy of 70 90 in just one hour Mathimani et al. 2018a Ray et al. 2021 . The primary benefit of chitosan is that it degrades naturally thus the flocs won t become contaminated. Because of its high cost chitosan is not suited for processing on a wide scale. Due to the extremely large surface charge and dispersion at that stage of growth it is challenging to neutralize the negative surface charge of exponentially expanding algae Li et al. 2022 . Microalgae flocculation is enhanced by raising the pH of the medium with NaOH because stationary growth results in a decrease in negative surface charges. Controlling factors including the size of the microalgae species the broth s biomass concentration the kind and number of flocculants and the culture medium s ionic strength all help achieve high flocculation efficiency. The surface charge and size of microalgae species affect the flocculation activity of biomass concentrate Ogbonna et al. 2021 . Since microalgal harvesting is quick and efficient it has become popular in conjunction with inorganic flocculants. The commonly used inorganic flocculants are ammonium sulfate NH4 2SO4 ammonium chloride NH4Cl zinc sulfate ZnSO4 zinc chloride Fe2 SO4 3 iron chloride FeCl3 zinc sulfate ZnCl2 etc. Both the effectiveness and biodegradability of inorganic flocculants are very high. The main disadvantage of using inorganic flocculants is that they become contaminated during downstream processes. Extracellular polymeric substances EPS or secreted biopolymers are the source of flocculation in bioflocculation as opposed to artificial flocculants Fig. 6d Ray et al. 2021 . There are several types of bioflocculation actinomycetes fungi bacteria plants and hybrids. One of the most frequent sources of bioflocculation according to the research is bacteria. The capacity of microalgae to adhere to their surface and form flocs along with the high concentration of EPS are prerequisites for microalgal bioflocculation Choi et al. 2020 . Harvesting microalgal biomass through co-cultivation with bacteria and fungi is an additional advantageous method. Microalgal biomass growth and harvesting are impacted by microbial contamination that arises from co-cultivating microalgae with microorganisms Satpati et al. 2023 . Microalgae cells aggregate more quickly as a result of cationic polymers reduction of electronegativity Li et al. 2020 . Recent research has utilized starch-based flocculants for microalgae harvesting due to their non-toxic properties and low cost You et al. 2022 . Bioflocculation is a simple cost-effective energy-efficient method of harvesting microalgae. Microalgae harvesting is becoming more interested in magnetic separation because of its simplicity time-saving nature reusability and streamlined material synthesis Markeb Exploring the potential and progress of microalgae biomass et al. 2019 . The basic theory behind this harvesting method is to use magnetic particles to find microalgal cells and then an external magnetic field to easily remove them from the culture Fig. 6e . The working principle is the separation of suspended microalgal- tagged particle cells recovered due to their inherent paramagnetic movement caused by the external magnetic field Savvidou et al. 2021 . Naked Fe3O4 particles silica-coated magnetic particles chitosan-Fe3O4 nanoparticles CPAM-Fe3O4 magnetic flocs Fe3O4-PEI nanocomposites DEAE and PEI magnetic beads etc. are the magnetic particles used in the harvesting of microalgae cells. Fe3O4 nanoparticles have been effectively employed for recovering a variety of microalgal strains and removing toxic pollutants from wastewater due to their superparamagnetic nature and specific surface area Tahir et al. 2020 . Nevertheless because of their poor harvesting efficiency uncoated Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles are rarely used in microalgae harvesting. The harvesting efficiency is enhanced by adding functional components or surface coatings to Fe3O4-based magnetic nanoparticles that are uncoated coated or functionalized. Magnetic nanoparticles had a greater harvesting effectiveness of approximately 95 in comparison to alternative approaches. For brief periods of time the flocculation approach works better than magnetic materials. After eight minutes though magnetic separation outperformed flocculation. It implies that longer contact times lead to more efficient harvesting. Microalgal biomass is harvested using magnetic nanoparticles because of their exceptional efficiency and cycle stability. Post-harvest separation nanoparticle recycling and practical use raise the overall process cost. 5.2 Dewatering methods 5.2.1 Filtration Through the use of a substance that only permits fluid to pass through it solids and fluids are separated from one another via filtration. The following are some of the most often used filtering techniques for microalgal harvesting dead-end vacuum pressure tangential flow filtration TFF microfiltration ultrafiltration and macrofiltration Enamala et al. 2018b. This method involves passing the slurry through a porous membrane that retains the microalgae cells while forcing water through a filter Fig. 6f . Microalgae deposits on the filtration membrane grow thicker in this process leading to clogging or fouling. Although larger microalgae are better filtered smaller species such as Scenedesmus Chlorella and Dunaliella are not properly filtered. Due to their low cost and absence of chemicals micro- and ultrafiltration are ideal for small-scale microalgae production Fernandes et al. 2020 . Tangential flow filtration TFF can recover 70 90 of freshwater microalgae cells and is a dependable technique for harvesting smaller microalgae cells because of its superior anti-fouling performance Roy Mohanty 2019a . Conversely big microalgae cells with a cell diameter larger than 70 µm are a good fit for dead-end filtration Ghazvini et al. 2022a 2022b . 5.2.2 Centrifugation A radially acting centripetal force separates the microalgae biomass during the centrifugation process because of the difference in density between the microalgae particle and its surroundings Najjar Abu-Shamleh 2020 . A variety of centrifuges have been used to harvest algal cells either in a one-step or two-step process involving A. S. Rajpoot et al. biomass preconcentration with varying degrees of efficiency Ghazvini et al. 2022a 2022b . The centrifuge s slurry retention time settling depth which can be lowered by centrifuge design and the settling properties of the cells are the main factors that affect the centrifugation process overall efficiency Show et al. 2017 . Although the food and pharmaceutical industries have long employed the centrifugation method new and modified centrifuge designs have been developed to use it for the harvesting of microalgae needed for the production of biofuels Baskar et al. 2019 . This technique is fast therefore it is generally preferred and it provides a high biomass recovery rate of 80 to 95 under ideal conditions. Based on harvested microalgal efficiency and biomass quantity the nozzle-type technique is a promising centrifugation method among others. However it is costly Ghazvini et al. 2022a 2022b . Furthermore all microalgae strains have a low risk of bacterial contamination of the biomass. Due to its significant energy consumption and high cost it is economically incompatible. Centrifugation can be used in combination with other harvesting techniques to increase overall energy production reduce emissions and cut down on the cost of handling and processing. Researchers have studied the effects of combining centrifugation with various methods such as microfiltration coagulation chemical flocculation bioflocculation magnetic separation and so on Yin et al. 2020 and discovered high energy requirements and low cost in two-step harvesting with the centrifugation method. Compared to other combinations centrifugation combined with flocculation requires less energy and a lower cost. 5.3 Integration of harvesting techniques Every technique for harvesting microalgae has advantages and disadvantages of its own. It is impossible to accomplish microalgal harvesting with a single technique. Therefore combining techniques has the potential to increase harvesting efficiency. When electro-flocculation and flotation were combined Botryococcus braunii showed improved efficiency Maleki et al. 2014 . The study shows that when flocculation and centrifugation are combined energy consumption is lower than in single-method applications Okoro et al. 2019b . When compared to centrifugation coagulation- flocculation improves harvesting efficiency. Adding flocculant or coagulant to the suspension prior to gravity sedimentation facilitates a quicker and more effective setting of the small algal cells. But it s crucial to take into account the unique traits and conditions of various microalgae species when combining various harvesting techniques. Based on the ideas of electro-coagulation electro-flocculation and electro-flotation electrochemical harvesting techniques offer a novel economical and effective way to harvest microalgae while reducing the need for chemical products Sinha et al. 2019 . Electrolytic techniques for flocculation and coagulation have demonstrated an endless range of applications and enhanced efficacy Geada et al. 2018 . Similar to electro- coagulation electro-flotation is an electrolytic process where gas bubbles attach to suspended particles and escape from the water electrolysis pushing the particles to the surface of the vessel Ghernaout et al. 2015 . Since the anode produces coagulating ions that destabilize microalgae suspension integrating electro-coagulation-flotation ECF appears to be a promising substitute for microalgae harvesting.

Biomass pretreatment is a critical and costly step in large-scale biofuel generation. The methods used for pre-treatment of biomass include physical methods such as microwave ultrasonic electron beam gamma etc. mechanical such as high- pressure homogenizers grinding milling chipping bead mills etc. thermal such as steam explosion autoclave etc. chemical such as organic inorganic ionic acidic alkali catalytic enzymatic etc. physiochemical such as wet oxidation liquid hot water supercritical fluid ammonia fibre explosion AFEX etc. and biological meth- ods Zabed et al. 2019a 2019b . Although many different methods for pre-treatment Fig. 7 Pre-treatment of microalgae biomass for conversion into biofuels A. S. Rajpoot et al. of microalgal biomass have been developed there is currently no optimum method yet to be discovered. Researchers need to discover some effective biomass pretreatment techniques for biofuel production that are optimized for various feedstocks. The lysis of microalgal cells to extract the stored carbohydrates from the cells is a type of pretreat- ment of microalgal biomass for fermentation. Because fermenting bacteria only convert fermentable sugars to ethanol the sugars that have been collected must be saccharified into monomeric units Lakatos et al. 2019 . Currently the commonly used biofuels include biogas biodiesel biobutanol bioethanol bio-oil and biohydrogen. Acids and alkalis are commonly used to pretreat microalgal biomass for bioethanol synthesis. Chemical biological thermo-chemical or thermo-physical techniques are adopted sometimes in combination depending on the objective of the pre-treatment. Cell lysis requires the saccharification of sugar macromolecules Rajarapu Scharf 2017 . Furthermore the microalgae cellulose necessitates the development of more effective degradation and conversation methods. Pre-treatments of biomass are done to derive the desired bioproduct from microalgae viz. bioethanol biogas or biodiesel Ramaraj et al. 2022 . As a result mechanical pre-treatment yields biodiesel whereas enzymatic and chemical pre-treatment yield bioethanol. Microalgae pre-treatment is very inexpensive compared to other food crops and non-edible biomass. Microalgal carbohydrates are degraded using acids or enzymes to produce bioethanol- fermentable sugars. The decomposition of microalgae biomass requires a temperature of about 120 200 °C. However acid hydrolysis of microalgal biomass is considered to be more effective than other thermal and physical treatments. Strong acids are used mostly for this purpose while weak acids are unable to lyse the microalgae cells and extract the core carbohydrates. Some mechanical techniques such as ultrasonication microwaves and other methods have been used in some experiments to decompose algal biomass Zabed et al. 2019a 2019b . To optimize the pretreatment process chemical and mechanical approaches can be combined. They do not pollute the environment but they do increase energy-related costs Kannah et al. 2021 . Fermentation processes are more productive and efficient when algal biomass is pretreated with enzymes Pérez-Alva et al. 2022 . Catalysts that hydrolyze a sugar substrate include amylase cellulase and some others. This method however is too expensive for commercial biomass pretreatment on a large scale due to the high cost of enzymes Zabed et al. 2019a 2019b . Two essential steps in the conventional method of making biodiesel are oil extraction and the transesterification procedure Rajpoot et al. 2023b . Microalgal biodiesel production is too costly to be commercialized. The process of lipid extraction and the drying of wet microalgae both significantly affect costs. In order to avoid the need for two stages of lipid extraction and transesterification in situ transesterification was created. A study investigated the effects of co-solvent and reaction parameters on the composition of the fatty acid ester yield of wet Chlorella vulgaris microalgae Nguyen et al. 2020 . The findings showed that in wet microalgal conditions increasing the methanol concentration significantly enhanced the production of fatty acid ester more than increasing the H2SO4 concentration. The equilibrium moved in the direction of the FAME product at high methanol concentrations. Additionally it was found that utilizing a small amount of n-butanol or tetrahydrofuran THF as a co-solvent significantly increased the production of fatty acid ester and decreased the consumption of methanol by 33 .

To optimize biomass utilization and promote zero-waste solutions the leftover byproducts from these processes are further utilized in anaerobic digestion and fermentation to produce additional products like biohydrogen biomethane and biohythane Goswami et al. 2021 . Direct burning of microalgal biomass is a creative way to get around the problems with producing biofuel from liquid sources. This technique offers a practical way to attain zero carbon emissions while optimizing energy production and being compatible with conventional coal boilers. To enable its widespread adoption more research is needed H. I. Choi et al. 2019a 2019b . The process of turning microalgae into biochar offers a useful way to use biomass. Biochar which is produced from biomass that has been treated for wastewater is useful for making adsorbents materials for sequestering carbon and environmentally friendly biofertilizers. Research has looked into the use of microalgae to produce biomass that can be converted into biochar remove nutrients from sewage and investigate its many uses Jaiswal et al. 2023 Santos Pires 2018 . The conversion of biofuel has traditionally involved chemical physiological or thermochemical and biological processes Goswami et al. 2021 . Algal biomass has been converted into bio-oil through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction HTL which needs high temperatures 300 °C and a 15-min reaction time Calijuri et al. 2023 . A rapid HTL method that produces biocrude at a high heating rate in less than two minutes has been developed recently Gu et al. 2020 . Earlier techniques for producing biodiesel from algal biomass required labor-intensive drying and dewatering procedures. In order to overcome this attempts have been made to produce biodiesel by combining wet algal biomass with microwave irradiation. However this process is less environmentally friendly because it uses non-recyclable acidic and basic catalysts. Graphene-based catalysts which provide high catalytic efficiency and low toxicity for converting extracted lipids into FAME are one type of solid acid catalyst that help mitigate this problem Ahmed et al. 2022 . Co-solvent methods and ethanol-chloroform binary reactants are frequently employed for in-situ microalgal biomass. However higher FAEE and improved carbohydrate sac- charification are obtained by employing ethyl acetate as a catalyst or reactant for the in situ transesterification of wet microalgal biomass Karpagam et al. 2021 . Transesterified biodiesel has been considered in numerous studies for testing in diesel engines to assess emission metrics and performance Rajpoot et al. 2023a 2023b 2023c Tamilselvan et al. 2017 . Another cutting-edge technique is wet hydrolysis-esterification which produces biodiesel directly from microalgal biomass by omitting the stages of lipid extraction and drying. By using in-situ transesterification with ultrasonic assistance recent technologies have optimized this process to produce biodiesel directly achieving FAME contents of up to 87.68 in just 100 min Karimi 2017 . Figure 8 illustrates the downstream process of turning microalgal biomass into biofuels. Moreover investigating genetic engineering methods to augment microalgae s lipid biosynthesis pathways raises the quantity and caliber of biofuels produced. It is possible to increase the productivity affordability and environmental sustainability of microalgae-based biofuel production by combining these creative methods with developments in cultivation and harvesting practices. A. S. Rajpoot et al. 7 Results and discussion Microalgal biomass production has enormous potential for producing biofuels because of its high biomass yield improved lipid content and environmental adaptability. Because of its quick growth rates and effective absorption of carbon dioxide microalgae performs better than traditional crops yielding an oil yield per acre that is up to twenty-five times greater. This makes microalgae a very productive alternative feedstock. The outcomes of several methods for raising the productivity and economy of microalgae-based biofuel production are covered in this section. 7.1 Effectiveness of harvesting techniques Various methods are used for harvesting and the choice of technique depends upon microalgal species and culture medium composition. Multiple-method integration has been found to improve efficiency. The use of electro-flocculation in conjunction with flotation dramatically increases harvesting efficiency. For example each method used more biomass recoveries for Botryococcus braunii when the electro-flocculation was combined with flotation. Coupling flocculation with centrifugation reduces energy consumption and allows for a high recovery rate in the combined process. Compared with centrifugation alone the coagulation-flocculation process significantly improves harvesting performance. Fig. 8 Downstream process of microalgae biofuel production Exploring the potential and progress of microalgae biomass The use of a flocculant or coagulant prior to gravity sedimentation accelerates rapid settling and improves the recovery of fine algal cells. 7.2 Pre treatment techniques for higher biofuel yields Biofuel production from microalgal biomass requires a strong pretreatment of the algal biomass as it breaks down the cell walls to release intracellular components like lipids and carbohydrates. The review highlighted that among other possible chemical methods acid hydrolysis has proven to be specifically efficient for pretreatment of microalgal biomass and conversion of carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. Sulfuric acid in particular is commonly utilized due to its great saccharification efficiency despite its cost and environmental issues. In a comparative instance physical procedures including bead milling and high-pressure homogenization were shown to be energy-intensive but necessary for large-scale operations. Mechanical procedures like microwave and ultrasonic treatments are gaining popularity for their ability to crack cell walls quickly and efficiently especially when paired with chemical methods providing an effective and time-saving option. 7.3 Quality of biofuel produced The biofuel derived from microalgae particularly biodiesel bioethanol and biochar is of a higher quality than that obtained when using traditional crops. Notably microalgae are a rich source of lipids and therefore they have strength over other biological feedstocks for biodiesel production. For instance the in-situ transesterification of Chlorella vulgaris using methanol and co-solvents such as n-butanol or tetrahydrofuran greatly increased fatty acid ester yields achieving a conversion efficiency of up to 87.68 in optimal conditions for biodiesel production. It has been demonstrated that combining acid hydrolysis and enzymatic saccharification maximizes sugar conversion rates for bioethanol production. Microalgae-based biochar makes a good promise to be used as a fertilizer adsorbent and also in the sequestering of carbon. This is formed through the carbonization of biomass residue after the algae biodiesel process. The ability to repurpose residual biomass into value-added products further boosts the sustainability and economic viability of microalgae-based biofuel systems. 7.4 Economic feasibility The economic feasibility of microalgae-based biofuel production at large scale is determined by several factors such as the costs of cultivation harvesting pre-treatment and conversion. Open-pond systems are less expensive to install and maintain than PBRs but they offer less productivity and yield control. Innovative harvesting techniques such as electrocoagulation reduce energy usage and lower costs by up to 40 compared to typical centrifugation procedures making them more economically viable. The development of energy-efficient pre-treatment technologies such as wet hydrolysis-esterification has the potential to reduce operational costs by eliminating the need for drying and extraction phases. Furthermore the integration of biofuel production with wastewater treatment plants is a futuristic approach to lower operational costs by utilizing the produced biomass as a nitrogen source hence improving economic feasibility. A. S. Rajpoot et al. 7.5 Barriers to commercialization Microalgae-derived biofuels are economically viable to some extent but there are a series of bottlenecks for commercial production in the market. Moving from a lab to an industrial-size scale is still incredibly challenging needing large capital investments and sheer technological progress. One of the main obstacles is the high initial cost of setting up large-scale processing and cultivation facilities particularly photobioreactors. In addition processes such as drying and lipid extraction are energy intensive so they do not aid in commercialization. Newer approaches such as microwave-assisted transesterification and wet hydrolysis-esterification although in need of larger-scale validation and even more optimization have the potential to decrease energy consumption. Market acceptability and regulatory obstacles are additional difficulties because biofuels need to adhere to strict regulations and because public opinion affects market dynamics. The solution for these obstacles entails enhancing the selection of strains with higher lipid contents refining cultivation practices and creating harvesting and pre-treatment strategies that are economical. 8 Conclusions This review examines the potential of microalgae as a sustainable feedstock as well as current advancements in microalgae-based biofuel production. The study used a systematic review methodology to gather and analyze data from pertinent literature. An extensive search was carried out across several databases using specific terms associated with microalgae and biofuel production. The study finds that microalgae perform better than conventional crops in a number of crucial areas such as oil yield lipid content superior biofuel conversion capacity production in non-arable land and wastewater resources after treatment the ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and industrial wastes while being grown and overall productivity. The capacity of microalgae to grow quickly in a variety of conditions emphasizes their suitability for large-scale biofuel production. The review identifies effective harvesting techniques that improve biomass recovery and use less energy. These techniques include electro-flocculation in conjunction with flotation and flocculation in conjunction with centrifugation. Effective lipid extraction and biofuel production depend on pre-treatment methods that are chemical physical and mechanical in nature. Techniques for dissolving microalgal cell walls that demonstrate high efficacy include acid hydrolysis microwaves and ultrasonic treatments. Microalgae produce high- quality biofuels such as biodiesel bioethanol and biochar. High conversion efficiencies are attained through optimized processes offering microalgal-based biofuels as a competitive substitute for fossil fuels. The processes tools machinery and technologies used to produce biofuel from microalgae are still only capable of being produced on a laboratory scale. By overcoming the current significant barriers and constraints it will be feasible to produce microalgae biofuel on a large scale for commercial use in the future. The research community must work together across disciplinary boundaries to progress technology and establish microalgae-based biofuels as a sustainable substitute for fossil fuels. Future studies are required to focus on optimizing strain selection for efficient biomass and lipid production refining cultivation conditions temperature light nutrients pH and developing cost-effective energy-efficient and environmentally friendly harvesting Exploring the potential and progress of microalgae biomass and pre-treatment methods. Additionally research should explore multiple applications of microalgae beyond biofuels including food cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and integrate multidisciplinary efforts for a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Moreover research should investigate the environmental impacts and lifecycle assessments of microalgae biofuel production to ensure sustainability.

These phototrophic organisms are unique in a sense that they utilise natural sources like sunlight water and CO2 for their growth and metabolism thereby producing diverse products that can be processed to produce biofuel biochemical nutraceuticals feed biofertilizer and other value added products. But due to low biomass productivity and high harvesting cost microalgae-based production have not received much attention. Therefore this review provides the state of the art of the microalgae based biorefinery approach to define an economical and sustainable process. The three major segments that need to be considered for economic microalgae biorefinery is low cost nutrient source efficient harvesting methods and production of by-products with high market value. This review has outlined the use of various wastewater as nutrient source for simultaneous biomass production and bioremediation. Further it has highlighted the common harvest- ing methods used for microalgae and also described various products from both raw biomass and delipidified microalgae residues in order to establish a sustainable economical microalgae biorefinery with a touch of circular bioeconomy. This review has also discussed various challenges to be considered followed by a techno-economic analysis of the microalgae based biorefinery model. Keywords Microalgae Wastewater Biorefinery Delipidified biomass Circular economy Zero waste Introduction The 3rd generation biofuels obtained from microalgae has garnered interest in the recent times owing to its advantages over the 1st and 2nd generation of biofuels. The earlier gen- erations of biofuel are derived from agricultural land and forest residues thereby requiring a significant amount of fer- tiliser water and large areas of crop land Ullah et al. 2018 . This directly or indirectly impacts food security predomi- nantly in the developing nations Borse and Sheth 2017 . On the other hand microalgae have various advantages over land- based crops for oil production. The simple structure and high photosynthetic efficiency results in higher oil yield per unit area than other oilseed crops. Also algal growth is not dependent on arable land and fresh water for its cultiva- tion and can be cultivated on marginal land using marine water or industrial effluent and therefore does not compete for resources that are associated with conventional agricul- ture. Microalgae cultivation does not require addition of pes- ticides or herbicides and its cultivation when coupled with CO2 and nutrient uptake from industrial gases and effluents respectively may solve some of the major environmental concerns faced by the world. In addition to solving environ- mental concerns several products viz. biofuels pigments nutraceuticals fertilizers and animal feed could be produced from the microalgal biomass Levasseur et al. 2020 . Biofuels have the capability to eliminate the dependency on fossil fuels as well as economic disturbances caused due to fluctuations in prices of each fossil fuel. Also biofuels have additional advantage of reducing the green house gases GHG thereby improving the air quality. Microalgae are Madhuri Narra 1 Bioconversion Technology Division Sardar Patel Renewable Energy Research Institute Vallabh Vidyanagar Post Box No. 2 Anand Gujarat 388120 India 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 2 of 29 driven by solar energy using CO2 for performing photosyn- thesis and store energy in the form of lipid thereby cleaning environment and generate lipid. Microalgae has the potential to convert 183 tons of CO2 which translates into 100 tons of microalgal biomass which is higher as compared to higher plants Eloka-Eboka et al. 2017 . Thus microalgae when utilised in a holistic manner for the development of biofuels and other value added products has the potential to provide alternative sources of various products there by maintaining a low inflation rate especially of biofuels while achieving the mandates of a clean and green environment Milano et al. 2016 . Microalgae besides biofuels are a potential source of substrates for a variety of industries including food feed fertilizers nutrition and cosmetics Mathimani and Pugaz- hendhi 2019 Kumar et al. 2020 . However cost of nutrients for microalgal cultivation is a major hindrance in commercialization of microalgae based industries. Here industrial effluents rich in nutrients for microalgae come to the rescue. Along with its cultiva- tion microalgae also serve the purpose of bioremediation of industrial effluent and recover clean water thereby reducing the impact of environmental concern of fresh water short- age. Fresh water microalgae sp. such as Chlorella has been reported to accumulate up to 30 lipids when cultivated in wastewater Chen et al. 2015 . A salient feature of microalgae is its capacity to be pro- ductive throughout the year which is not possible with most of the crops. Also high oil yield per unit area is obtained from microalgae as compared to terrestrial crops without addition of pesticides and herbicides which is in-line with world s goal of energy independence Hannon et al. 2010 Benemann and Oswald 1996 . However microalgae produc- tion at large scale is significantly expensive as compared to production of conventional crops owing to hefty usage of water and nutrients majorly carbon nitrogen and phospho- rus sources Dalrymple et al. 2013 Yang et al. 2011a b Leite et al. 2013 . Since these elements are also required for conventional crop cultivation its application for microalgae cultivation poses a direct competition and threat for fertiliz- ers Peccia et al. 2013 . Another critical obstacle in the path of microalgae culti- vation at commercial scale is the fresh water usage. Global consumption of fresh water stands at around 4 trillion cubic metres every year Moreover total N and P concentration can be between 10 and 100 mg L in municipal effluent and can reach upto 1000 mg L in indus- trial effluent Chen et al. 2015 . Release of such high con- centrations of N and P in water bodies would lead to damage of aquatic ecosystem due to eutrophication in water bodies. Microalgae have shown potential to competently remove nitrogen phosphorus and toxic metals from a variety of effluent streams viz. municipal agricultural and industrial which makes microalgae a potential candidate for biological remediation of wastewater Cai et al. 2013 Markou and Georgakakis 2011 . Microalgae unlike other feedstocks have an upper hand due to a no competition for fresh water and arable land b high growth rate c high oil content up to 40 d reduces carbon footprint thereby reduces green house gases and prevents global warming e provides biological treat- ment for industrial effluent unlike conventional treatment methods employing harsh chemicals and energy intensive physical treatment f microalgal biomass generated is rich in lipid protein starch which has potential application in biofuel aquafeed and fertiliser industries Cai et al. 2013 . Many researchers have published reviews based on micro- algae derived products upstream downstream methods in a microalgae based biorefinery model and bioremediation. This review not only provides a state-of-the-art of the micro- algae cultivation and harvesting techniques but also high- lighted detailed insights into various products from both raw and delipidified microalgae biomass. Delipidified microalgae products are mostly neglected in published microalgae based reviews. This review has highlighted delipidified microal- gae as a major source of microalgae biorefinery product in order to make it a sustainable circular bioeconomy model. It has also emphasised on the bottlenecks of large scale pro- duction of microalgae biomass and products and concluded with few solutions. This review has also analysed techno- economics of different microalgae models so as to present a complete picture of microalgae-based industrial scenario and its current status. Techno-economic sustainability analysis highlights the key areas where the improvements are needed to make microalgae model feasible and successful in the long run. This review has further highlighted an in-house case study based on bioconversion of microalgae biomass in order to provide some realistic scenario of microalgae biorefinery. Integrated microalgae biorefinery The microalgae biorefinery approach is a continuous pro- cess which integrates simultaneous cultivation extraction and production of energy and other value added products from microalgae biomass Fig. 1 . Microalgae are photosyn- thetic entities which has the ability to mitigate greenhouse gases like CO2 by utilising it for growth and metabolism thereby combating global warming Yadav et al. 2019 . Although microalgae are freshwater organisms but they have the potential to adapt and grow in marine water and industrial wastewater. This in turn approves the phenomena of conversion of waste to energy and high value products. Microalgae biorefinery has numerous advantages over other biorefineries in a way that multiple products can be targeted ranging from energy to bioactive compounds modest reactor 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 3 of 29 378 designs for cultivation utilisation of natural resources like sunlight air wastewater for growth and production ambi- ent operating conditions. Such diversity is not visible with other biorefineries for example lignocellulosic or sugarcane biorefinery which requires complex reactor designs energy intensive pretreatment process complex media composition sterile conditions to avoid contamination and less diversity in products. Moreover the microalgae residue left over after lipid or protein extraction is still a source of nutrients and can be channelled to produce biofuels and animal feed which makes it a waste-free biorefinery concept. However the cru- cial stage in microalgae biorefinery is to minimise loss of product yields at each stage while separation of different fragments. Due to small size and low density of microalgae cultures loss of biomass is critical at every step. This issue can be solved by employing scalable low-cost and energy- efficient separation techniques. Microalgae biomass is a great raw material for biorefinery approach as it can yield multiple components suitable for various industries such as food energy pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry thereby providing high flexibility towards changing markets. In this review we have emphasised on use of wastewater as a source of nutrition for microalgae biomass production and utilising the biomass and lipid extracted biomass as a potential feedstock to produce multiple products thereby establishing an integrated microalgae biorefinery approach. Microalgae biomass production and wastewater treatment Wastewater as a nutritional source Wastewater is a rich source of nutrients including miner- als metals and trace elements whose concentration varies with the sources. Improper disposal of wastewater from industries agriculture and municipal is a major source of pollution of water and soil. The pollutants in the form of heavy metals and other toxic elements pose a threat to the environment. Moreover excessive nutrients present in wastewater in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus also results in eutrophication in lakes thereby disturbing the ecosystem. These serious environmental issues caused by wastewater has called for ways for proper utilisation and disposal of wastewater from different sources. Currently conventional methods of wastewater treatment are widely Fig. 1 Schematic representation of various products derived from raw and delipidified microalgae 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 4 of 29 used in industries to reduce the toxic levels of metals and nutrients prior to discharge or reuse Gogate et al. 2004 Raza et al. 2018 Varjani et al. 2019 . But these methods are not economical and environment friendly as it involves both chemical and physical processes to reduce the toxicity of wastewater. Various biological processes are also opted for wastewater treatment using different microbial flora which has the ability to utilise the nutrients and convert them into energy products like hydrogen ethanol biodiesel etc. Machineni et al. 2019 . Microalgae is one such flora which has the ability to utilise the nutrients of wastewa- ter for its growth and metabolism Table 1 . Microalgae require large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous for its growth and wastewater from various sources are rich in these elements Li et al. 2019a b . Therefore efficient cultivation of microalgae acts as a promising tool for treat- ment of toxic effluents. Moreover nitrogen and phospho- rus present in wastewater helps to improve both quality and quantity of lipid accumulation in the microalgae cells. This lipids act as a raw material for biodiesel production. Economics of the biorefinery concept of microalga prod- ucts does not fit well and operational cost is the major challenge. Utilization of wastewater as nutrient source for microalgae biomass production reduces a major part of the production cost thereby making the biorefinery concept feasible Nagarajan et al. 2020 . Nitrogen is used in its organic form as the building block of biological molecules such as proteins and lipids in all living organisms. The metabolic pathway of microalgae can utilise nitrogen in its inorganic form as nitrates ammonia nitrogen gas or nitric acid and converts them into its organic form by a process called assimilation Akgul et al. 2020 . Microalgae assimilates nitrate and nitrites which is then reduced to ammonium by biological catalysts nitrate reduc- tase and nitrite reductase. Optimised carbon nitrogen ratio has demonstrated higher biomass production of 5 g L with increased lipid content up to 60.34 in microalgae Chloro- coccum sp. Khanra et al. 2020 . Microalgae prefers ammo- nium over other inorganic sources as its assimilation requires less energy and can be incorporated into amino acids within the cells. This further corroborates that wastewater rich in ammonium can serve as a good source of nitrogen and can help in rapid production of microalgae biomass. Phosphorus is another essential nutrient required for microalgae growth. Wastewater from different sources con- tains phosphorus as another major element. Phosphorus plays an important role in energy metabolism of microalgae and forms a major part of nucleotides proteins and lipids Zhuang et al. 2018 . Mostly phosphorus intake occurs in the form of orthophosphate PO4 2 and gets incorporated into the cells to generate ATP adenosine triphosphate which acts as a driving force for many cellular reactions Cai et al. 2013 . Phosphorus also acts as a building block of nucleic acids DNA RNA and thus helps in transmission of genetic information between generations. Thus wastewater contain- ing higher phosphorus can be a potential source of nutrient for microalgae growth. Carbon is another important nutritional element for effi- cient growth and photosynthesis of microalgae. Intake of carbon source occurs in microalgae in the form of CO2 or soluble carbonates. CO2 can be easily fixed by microalgae from atmosphere through Calvin-Benson cycle and gets incorporated into the cells in the form of carbohydrates. Industrial gases or flue gas are the major sources of CO2 and thus microalgae act as a promising tool to reduce the CO2 emissions by utilising it for its growth and metabolism. Fur- ther the presence of soluble carbonates CaCO3 Na2CO3 or bicarbonates in wastewater can also be utilised by microalgal cells for its growth Cai et al. 2013 . Other nutrients present in wastewater include microele- ments like iron calcium and heavy metals. These micronu- trients may be toxic to few species of microalgae at higher concentrations but there also exists few strains which are tolerant to heavy metals and other trace elements. Microele- ments play a major role in lipid accumulation and biomass productivity Ghafari 2018 . Therefore based on the micro- algae species used the nutrient composition in the wastewa- ter need to be maintained and optimised for efficient growth Table 1 Types of wastewater used as nutritional source for microalgae biomass production Sl. no.

In this section we have discussed various sources of wastewater which can be used as a nutri- tional source for microalgae cultivation. Further we discuss the criteria for selection of strains capable to grow and uti- lise specific nutrients present in various wastewater and the preferred methods of cultivation and harvesting microalgae. Agricultural wastewater India being an agricultural country generates large volume of wastewater from agricultural lands and farms. A major part of this stream of wastewater consists of surface runoff from fields which may contain fertilizers chemicals ani- mal manure soil minerals and crop residues. Fertilisers and manure contain nitrogen phosphorus and potassium as the major elements hence agricultural wastewater contains these nutrients in higher concentration Wollman et al. 2019 . Presence of these elements in agro wastewater supports the growth of microalgae along with removal of toxic molecules Gupta et al. 2019 . Farms with poultry and livestock opera- tions generate wastewater rich in organic content as well as NPK and ammonia. Apart from these beneficial nutrients it also contains many harmful pesticides chemicals and toxic metals which may inhibit the microalgae growth at higher concentrations. Therefore agro wastewater may require few pretreatment or purification steps prior to be used as a source of nutrition for microalgae biomass production. Industrial wastewater The nutritional composition of industrial wastewater varies based on their product and processing technology. Indus- trial effluents contain both nutritional and toxic elements in varied concentrations depending on the source of origin. Industries like leather pharmaceutical beverage oil drill- ing textile dyeing detergent and confectionaries contribute much to urban wastewater generation. These wastewater contains potassium sodium sulphur and nitrogen as the major elements which could be beneficially sourced towards algae biomass production. Various authors reported efficient phycoremediation strategies for various industrial effluents by using green algae Saranya et al. 2020 Almeida et al. 2020 Sharma et al. 2020 . Leather processing industries are involved in manufacturing of dyes pigments binders and also use various chemicals heavy metals for processing leathers which finally flows into effluents. Physico-chemical characterisation of this effluent revealed the presence of cal- cium magnesium potassium ammonia chloride sulphate and phosphate as major elements. Chlorella vulgaris was used for treatment of leather processing effluent and it grew luxuriantly with a biomass production of 1 g L dry weight and utilised almost 99 of the phosphates and 71 of the sulphates contained in the effluent. Sivasubramanium 2016 . Chlorella vulgaris resulted in removal of 84.68 and 98 of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively from MnO2 industry effluent Li et al. 2019a b . Similarly confection- ary industry effluents are nutritious source for microalgae growth since it contains enormous amounts of sugars sweeteners casein condensed milk along with food colours gums flavours which all together becomes a part of the efflu- ent. Effluent from a confectionary industry located in Chen- nai India was used for growing microalgae cells of Chlo- rella vulgaris which showed high biomass productivity of 1.5 g L. Another species of microalgae Chlorococcum humi- cola grew luxuriantly with algal biomass reaching 4.8 g L. Microalgae grown on confectionery industrial effluent also resulted in increased production of proteins and lipids within the cells thereby suggesting as an efficient nutrient source for microalgal lipid production. Textile industry effluents are highly alkaline and contain various dyes and chemicals like sodium bicarbonate sodium chloride sulphate phosphates etc. Sivasubramanium 2016 utilised wastewater from two textile dyeing industries located in Chennai and Ahmedabad for growing microalgae species such as Chlorococcum humicola Chroococcus turgi- dus and Desmococcus olivaceous. These cells grew well in the effluent utilising 89 of iron calcium magnesium and 46 of phosphate from the raw effluent thereby producing 0.75 g L of algal biomass. Among all strains used Chlo- rococcum humicola grew very well in the textile effluents. FAME analysis of oil extracted from this algal biomasss supports the existence of saturated fatty acids Heneicosanoic acid methyl ester C21 0 and Arachidic acide methyl ester C20 0 as major components indicating that it is highly suitable for biodiesel production. Dairy industrial wastewater generated from various pro- cessing streams is high in contaminants and also in nutrients whose improper discharge without treatment may not only lead to pollution but also may cause serious environmental issues like eutrophication of water bodies. India is the larg- est producer of milk in the world with 187.7 million tons of milk produced during 2018 2019. It is estimated that pro- cessing of each litre of milk generated about 1 1.5 L of dairy effluent which amounts to 300 450 lakh litres of effluent per day generated due to cleaning of containers and other pro- cessing activities. Effluents from dairy industries are a rich source of protein phosphorus nitrogen and high in organic matter with COD ranging from 1000 to 7000 mg L. Dairy wastewater can thus serve as nutrient source for microalgae growth thereby leading to bioremediation of wastewater. Treatment of dairy wastewater using microalgae will not only generate clean water but also produce algae biomass which acts as a sustainable feedstock for production of third generation biofuels and value added products. Recently sev- eral authors have evaluated various microalgae strains for dairy wastewater treatment Hena et al. 2015 Lu et al. 2015 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 6 of 29 Qin et al. 2016 . Huo et al. 2012 cultivated Chlorella zong- fingensis strain in dairy wastewater which resulted in 97.5 and 51.7 removal of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in 5 days. Similarly Ding et al. 2014 reported removal of 89 COD 91 phosphorus and 99 nitrogen from dairy effluent by microalgae cultivation. Cultivation of Chlorella sp. in raw dairy wastewater resulted in maximum biomass productivity of 110 mg L day in outdoor pilot-scale plant Lu et al. 2015 . Lipids extracted from it is highly rich in C16 C18 fatty acids showing high potential for production of biodiesel. Kumar and co-authors have evaluated both indoor and outdoor cultivation of microalga Ascochloris sp. ADW007 in dairy wastewater for simultaneous removal of nutrients along with lipids and high biomass productivity Kumar et al. 2018a b . Municipal wastewater Municipal wastewater MW which mainly originates from public usage have different characteristics as compared to other industrial wastewater and is a major source of pol- lution of water bodies. Most of the MW originates from public homes hospitals corporates and other community places and contains toxic chemical contaminants along with sewage matter. It is characterised by low COD and imbalanced nitrogen-phosphorus ratio as compared to other industrial effluent and hence considered as a weak medium for the cultivation of microalgae. Currently used biologi- cal methods for MW treatment includes trickling filters aerated lagoons activated sludge system and anaerobic processes can effectively remove biodegradable organic pollutants but removal of inorganic nutrients such as phosphorous nitrogen is usually inadequate. Presence of nitrogen as ammonia and nitrate salts and phosphorus as phosphates in MW can act as nutrient source for microalgal blooms which can be further channelled to produce biofuel lipids and other biobased products. The major challenge with microalgae-based MW treatment is the presence of excessive solid matter in the form of sewage or human waste which may help in the proliferation of other microbes like bacteria and protozoa and may also contain pathogenic microbes. Protozoa act as predators for microalgae and thus may inhibit its growth in municipal wastewater. This problem can be resolved by pre-treatment of MW prior to microalgae cultivation like filtration heat shock and UV treatment Cho et al. 2011 . Cho et al. suggested that filtra- tion of MW through 0.2 µm membrane prior to microalgae cultivation resulted in maximum biomass 0.67 g L and lipid productivity 22.9 mg fatty acids L day with simul- taneous removal of 92 total nitrogen and 86 of total phosphates. Various other researchers have also studied microal- gae cultivation for nitrogen and phosphorus removal in municipal wastewater Aketo et al. 2020 Chen et al. 2020 Xu et al. 2019 . Criteria for strain selection Microalgae differ significantly based on the cellular con- tents growth behaviour and metabolic pathways for target products. Therefore it is very important to select the right strain that best fit the process and products targeted for the biorefinery concept. The strain to be used in a biorefinery concept acts as a cell factory capable of producing vari- ous products through different metabolic pathways within a single cell. Growth rate oil productivity optimal growth conditions and scale-up potential are few specific parameters to be considered for selection of microalgal strain Leu and Boussiba 2014 . Further tolerance to environmental stress conditions such as pH temperature oxygen and toxic chemi- cals such as heavy metals are the most important characteris- tics to be considered for microalgae cultivation in wastewa- ter Chisti 2007 . In the following section microalgal strains which have the ability to grow under harsh operational con- ditions with high lipid productivity and also produce gener- ous amounts of proteins and pigments would be focussed. Lipid producing strains With a view to develop a microalgal biorefinery with bio- diesel as the main product the most important criteria to be considered for selection of microalgae strains is high lipid content. Lipids are accumulated in the form of droplets within the microalgae cells and its production is affected by various environmental factors such a light pH CO2 salinity nutrient and metal stress availability of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium. Literature provides numer- ous reports supporting increased lipid accumulation under abiotic stress conditions such as deprivation of nitrogen or phosphorus high intensity of light increased CO2. Lipid production ability of microalgae is determined by few quan- titative parameters viz. lipid productivity lipid yield lipid content and biomass productivity. Heterptrophic Chlorella protothecoides has been reported to be one of the high- est lipid and biomass producer with lipid productivity of 1.2 3.7 g L day and biomass productivity of 2.2 7.4 g L day. On the other hand mixotrophic Chlorella vulgaris is reported with a lipid productivity of 22.0 54.0 mg L day when grown in sunlight with glucose and glycerol as car- bon sources Chen et al. 2011 . Several studies have also reported algal biomass and lipid production by using dairy domestic and urban effluents although the production varied with different species and source of wastewater. Cultivation of Botryococcus braunii in domestic wastewater resulted in biomass productivity of 0.28 g L day and lipid content reached upto 25 of dry weight. On the other hand the same 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 7 of 29 378 species cultivated in synthetic medium resulted in reduction of biomass productivity 0.22 g L day and increased in lipid content upto 47 of dry weight. Use of urban wastewater for cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris showed higher lipid produc- tivity 14.31 mg L day as compared to synthetic medium Singh et al. 2017 . Dairy wastewater serves as one of the best nutrient source for microalgal growth with biomass pro- ductivity of 0.11 g L day in Chlorella sp. and 0.207 g L day in Ascochloris sp. Lu et al. 2015 Kumar et al. 2019 . The lipid content in Ascochloris sp. grown in raw dairy wastewa- ter reached upto 34.98 of dry weight. The lipid molecules produced by these species are tri-acyl glycerol TAG which acts as an excellent feedstock for biodiesel production. However few species of microalgae produce long chain poly unsaturated fatty acids PUFA which include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. These fatty acids have essential nutritional benefits on human health and is produced by many species such as Phaeodactylum tricornutum Nan- nochloropsis sp. Parietochloris incise and Thalassiosira sp. Leu and Boussiba 2014 . Other high value fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic EPA γ-linolenic docosahexae- noic acids DHA and arachidonic are also produced by few microalgae strains which can be extracted and used as pure nutritional supplements Brennan and Owende 2010 Yen et al. 2013 Cuellar-Bermudez et al. 2015 . Carbohydrate producing strains Carbohydrates accumulated in microalgal cells can be either used for bioethanol production or directly as food supple- ments or in cosmetic and textile industries as thickening agents emulsifiers and stabilisers. Porphyridium cruentum is widely used as a commercial strain in cosmetic industry as it hoards large amount of extracellular carbohydrates Leu and Boussiba 2014 . These polysaccharides are also used as antioxidant antitumor anticoagulant antiinflammatory antiviral and immunomodulating agents Yen et al. 2013 Grimm et al. 2015 Rodriguez- Zavala et al. 2010 . Pigment producing strains Pigments derived from microalgae include chlorophyll phy- cobiliproteins and carotenoids which are high value products with enormous demand in pharma and food markets. Chlo- rophyll is the most common and widely available micro- algae pigment which has found its way in various medical treatments such as ulcer treatment anaemia treatment by increasing the haemoglobin level in blood and also used as chelating agent in ointments Harun et al. 2010 . Pig- ment pheophorbide A derived from chlorophyll is being used for cancer treatment in humans like uterine sarcoma Yen et al. 2013 . The red carotenoid astaxanthin derived from Haematococcus pluvialis is known for its antioxidant properties and is currently marketed as a nutraceutical with a market potential of 200 million Koller et al. 2014 . Phy- cobiliproteins are well known for its high fluorescence and nonspecific binding properties due to which it finds wide application in biotechnology research as detection tools Yen et al. 2013 Cuellar-Bermudez et al. 2015 . R-phycoeryth- rin is a negatively charged highly fluorescent red protein which has wide applicability in fluorescence-based assays and currently marketed by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for 105.50 mg Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. 2009 2015 Cuellar-Bermudez et al. 2015 . Microalgae cultivation and harvesting In comparison to other energy crops microalgae can grow much rapidly due to higher photosynthetic efficiency. Micro- algae cultivation has numerous advantages over other oil- producing crops viz. i Suitable candidate for industrial raw material as it can accumulate various bioactive compounds ii Cultivable in non-arable land. No requirement of fertile land pesticides freshwater iii Cultivable in wastewater. No nutrients or fertiliser required iv Mitigation of green- house gases. Utilises CO2 for photosynthesis v Higher photosynthesis rate hence grows rapidly with short life cycle. In spite of these benefits microalgae have not gained much attention as a raw material for production of fuel and other high value compounds. This is mainly due to low bio- mass productivity and additional operating costs for har- vesting techniques. These problems can be compensated by increasing the growth rate or production capacity along with economical harvesting techniques. An ideal microal- gae cultivation system must satisfy the following factors i adequate light intensity ii simple operating system iii minimal contamination iv cheap cultivation configuration with high production efficiency v efficient vertical use of land. Microalgae cultivation system can be classified as open system and closed system. Open system includes raceway ponds and V-ponds whereas closed systems includes pho- tobioreactors tubular and flat plate . Table 2 provides a comparative comparison of all types of cultivation systems. Open systems Raceway ponds are one of the most common and oldest method of cultivation for large scale production of microal- gae biomass. It is generally oval-shaped closed loop struc- ture made of concrete or plastic. CO2 is spurged from bottom to achieve proper mixing and high rate of photosynthesis Fig. 2a . The system also contains paddlewheels at regular intervals to prevent sedimentation of biomass. This system is widely preferred because of low maintenance low energy input and low cost of construction. Average investment cost for construction of open raceway systems ranges from 0.13 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 8 of 29 Table 2 Comparison of various microalgae cultivation and harvesting methods Sl. no. Process Methods Advantages Disadvantages 1 Microalgae cultivation Raceway ponds Relatively cheap easy to clean utilise non agriculture land low energy inputs easy maintenance Poor biomass productivity large area of land required limited to a few strains of algae poor mixing cultures are easily contami- nated V-shaped ponds Easy to construct easy to operate cheap low production cost for algae biomass Poor light utilisation through cell evaporative losses require a large area poor diffusion of CO2 from the atmosphere Flat plate photobioreactor High biomass productivity easy to sterilise low oxygen build- up good light path large illumination surface area suitable for outdoor cultures Difficult to scale-up difficult for temperature control small degree of hydrodynamic stress some degree of wall growth Column photobioreactor Compact high mass transfer low energy consumption good mixing with low shear stress easy to sterilise reduced photo- inhibition and photo-oxidation Small illumination area expensive compared to open ponds shear stress Tubular photobioreactor Large illumination surface area suitable for outdoor cultures relatively cheap good biomass productivities Some degree of wall growth fouling requires large land space gradients of pH accumulation of dissolved oxygen and CO2 along the tubes 2 Harvesting Flocculation Wide range of flocculants available price varies although can be low cost Removal of flocculants chemical contamination and toxicity Filtration Wide variety of filter and membrane types available Highly dependent on algal species best suited to large algal cells clogging or fouling an issue Centrifugation Can handle most algal types with rapid efficient cell harvesting High capital and operational costs Flotation Can be more rapid than sedimentation possibility to combine with gaseous transfer Algal species specific high capital and operational cost 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 9 of 29 378 to 0.37 million euros ha at 100 ha scale which is equiva- lent to 1.1 to 3.2 crores INR ha Chisti 2012 Norsker et al. 2011 . The capacity of these reactors at industrial scale ranges from 1000 to 5000 m2 and maximum biomass pro- ductivity of 40 g m2 day has been reported which is equiva- lent to 150 ton ha2 year Lundquist et al. 2010 . Although biomass productivity varies with strain type of water salin- ity pH and climatic conditions. For example microalagal strain Tetraselmis suecica reported biomass productivity of up to 9 g m2 day whereas cultivation of Nannochloropsis sp. resulted in biomass productivity of 15 g m2 day Chi- aramonti et al. 2013 . V-shaped pond is another open system used for micro- algae cultivation which is economical and efficient as compared to open raceway ponds. It is in the shape of an inverted pyramid providing maximum surface area to the microalgae cells for efficient light absorption. Kumar et al. 2020 designed a high volume V-shape pond HVVP with a capacity of 3000 L which was concluded as one of the most economical system for microalgae cultivation Fig. 2b . This type of reactor was advantageous due to low cost of fabrication consisting of structures made of mild steel MS and polyvinyl sheets. Due to conical shape it also occu- pies less land surface reducing the total operational cost of cultivation. Closed systems Closed systems of microalgae cultivation includes photobio- reactors PBRs in the form of tubular column or flat plate reactors. These are enclosed systems with no direct exchange of material between culture and environment. As compared to open systems PBRs are compact reactors with highly controlled growth conditions which reduces contamination and also enhance biomass productivity. Tubular PBR consist of long transparent glass or plas- tic tubes arranged vertically or horizontally through which culture is circulated continuously for maximum exposure to light Fig. 3a . This system has constraints like O2 accumula- tion sedimentation of culture and poor mass transfer which reduces its efficiency. Vertical column PBR consist of a single cylindrical column made of plastic equipped with a spurger which pumps air for proper mixing and CO2 transfer into the cul- ture Fig. 3b . This system provides best gas liquid mass transfer and simple operation with low energy demand. However it is not a preferred system for large scale produc- tion due to inadequate light exposure to microalgae cells due to the cylindrical shape and difficulties in cleaning the reactor. Flat plate PBR is a modified version of column PBR which is redesigned to minimise the constrains of column PBR. The rectangular shape of this reactor provides largest surface area for adequate light capture and low O2 accumu- lation thereby increasing rate of photosynthesis Fig. 3c . Various innovative design has been implemented to further improve its efficiency for commercial usage. Algenol Biotech LLC has developed a pilot scale facil- ity using polyethylene bags as flat plate reactors across 36 acres with a productivity of 8000 gallons of ethanol acre year Algenol Biotech LLC 2011 . Another company named Joule Unlimited Inc. have reported production of 25 000 gal Fig. 2 Schematic representation of standard open photobioreac- tors used for microalgae cultiva- tion a Open Raceway Pond b V-shaped Pond 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 10 of 29 acre year of ethanol and 15 000 gal acre year of biodiesel using pilot plant of flat plate PBR Lane 2015 . Two stage hybrid system is an advanced form of micro- algae cultivation where two types of separate reactors are combined for high biomass productivity and maximum lipid accumulation. The hybrid system integrates airlift tubular photobioreactors for continuous growth of microalgae cells and open raceway ponds which promotes high lipid accumu- lation under nutrient deficient conditions. This type of culti- vation not only results in high productivity but also reduces contamination issues. Narala and co-authors have studied and compared hybrid system with open raceway and tubular PBR and found it to be more superior in terms of high lipid production Narala et al. 2016 . Moreover a life cycle assess- ment of a hybrid cultivation system using Chlorella vugaris showed 38 savings in fossil-energy requirements and 42 savings in global warming potential Adesanya et al. 2014 . Microalgae harvesting Harvesting techniques are used to separate microalgae bio- mass from culture media to facilitate extraction of energy and other value added products from biomass. Harvest- ing step accounts for 30 of total production cost due to energy demand and manpower requirement. Various har- vesting methods have been implemented for concentration of microalgae biomass such as filtration flocculation and centrifugation. Filtration is the simplest method of harvesting which utilise a semipermeable membrane with varied pore size that percolates water or culture medium thereby retaining microalgae biomass. This system requires no power input and can be used for large scale but it encounters problems like clogging and fouling which demands frequent change of filter membranes. This adds up to the processing cost. Use of cheap filter membranes can help to overcome this problem. Centrifugation is the most efficient and rapid method of harvesting as it removes water completely from biomass within fraction of time. But it is highly energy intensive and requires high power input which adds up to the production cost. Flocculation is another method for harvesting microal- gae cells which uses flocculating agents to aggregate the cells together to form floc. Chemical flocculants such as iron Fig. 3 Schematic representation of standard closed photobiore- actors PBR used for microal- gae cultivation a Tubular PBR b Column PBR c Flate plate PBR 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 11 of 29 378 and aluminum salts remove the surface charge of cells and results in precipitation of algal biomass. Flocculants like iron chloride and aluminum sulphate can flocculate 95 of microalgae biomass Chatsungnoen et al. 2019 . But these chemicals are toxic to nature and the removal process further ads to the cost of production. An alternative to this is the use of organic flocculants such as chitosan acrylic acid which are eco-friendly and safer to use. Chitosan has been reported to aggregate 90 of microalgae biomass at much lower dose as compared to chemical flocculants. Although centrifugation and filtration are currently used methods to harvest microalgae at industrial scale but recently flocculation have received much attention as researchers have found many opportunities to advance this method of harvesting. Use of magnetic nanoparticles as floc- culant has an advantage over conventional methods in terms of separation time and harvesting efficiency Khanra et al. 2020 Matter et al. 2019 . Iron oxide Fe3O4 nanoparticles when used to harvest microalgae cultures of B. braunii with a dose of 55.9 mg cell mg particles resulted in 98 har- vesting efficiency in 1 min. Similarly iron oxide embedded carbon microparticle was used at a dose of 25 g L 99 harvesting efficiency was obtained in 1 min Matter et al. 2019 . Another approach was claimed by Origin Oil Inc. where electromagnetic pulse is used to induce sedimenta- tion of microalgae cells by neutralising the surface charges. Recently research has also been focussed towards more advanced form of flocculation techniques by genetic modi- fication. Genetically engineered yeast has been applied as flocculants which has the ability to express extracellular pro- teins called flocculins on the cell surface which attach to the microalgae cells promoting aggregation Matter et al. 2019 . Similarly ligand-receptor mechanisms have been explored to enable fast and targeted aggregation where microbes expressing an antibody could be mixed with cells express- ing the specific antigen thereby inducing flocculation. Multi product biorefinery approach Although significant research is going on in the area of algal bioenergy but due to higher energy requirement and time consuming processes of cell culturing harvesting and con- version the algal biofuel is unable to compete in open market Grima et al. 2003 . A microalgal biorefinery concept com- bining all stages of algal cultivation with conversion of lipid to biofuel and other allied products is an attractive approach to make algal products commercially viable. Advanced bio- reactor design and development of new technologies for har- vesting dewatering and oil extraction can make the algal bioenergy feasible and competent in market. Microalgae is a rich source of proteins carbohydrates and lipids and hence can act as a feedstock for production of diverse products which includes biofuels biodiesel biohydrogen biometh- ane bioethanol and value added products such as protein pigment antioxidants Table 3 . Products from microalgae Microalgae acts as a cell factory producing diverse products ranging from lipids to small bioactive compounds. Microal- gal lipids such as triglyceride glycolipids phospholipids act as precursors of biodiesel omega-3 decosahexaenoic acid DHA and eicosapentanoic acid EPA respectively. Micro- algae are rich sources of food and neutraceutical products to fight against malnutrition around the globe. The microalgal bioactive compounds have wide applicability in pharmaceu- tical industries for synthesis of anticarcinogenic molecules antioxidants and antihypertensive agents Krishna 2019 . Microalgae can be utilised to extract essential amino acids proteins pro-vitamins and vitamins. Lipids Extraction of lipids Microalgal lipid extraction methods can be categorised as chemical and mechanical methods. Chemi- cal process of lipid extraction includes organic solvents chlo- roform methanol hexane supercritical CO2 and ionic sol- vent extraction. On the other hand mechanical methods of extraction involves the application of microwave ultrasonic waves bead beating and oil expeller Halim et al. 2011 . A Chemical methods for lipid extraction a Solvent extraction method The microalgal lipid can be extracted using polar and non-polar sol- vents. The principle behind the solvent extraction of lipid is based on the concept of basic chemis- try like dissolves like . The non-polar solvents are combined with polar solvents to maximise the lipid yield. The most commonly used method for lipid extraction is the Bligh and Dyer 1959 method which is a modification of Folch method Bligh and Dyer 1959 . This method utilised a mixture of chloroform and methanol in a ratio of 1 1 or 1 2 v v to extract lipids from homogenised microalgae biomass. The lipids get accumulated in the upper chloroform phase while proteins are precipitated at the interphase of the two solvents. The chloroform is recovered using fractional dis- tillation which can be reused for the next batch. Another approach for solvent based lipid extrac- tion is the soxhlet extraction using single or a mix- ture of solvents like hexane ethyl acetate ethyl lactate 2-methyltetrahydrofuran 2-MeTHF cyclopentyl methyl ether CPME in a soxhlet 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 12 of 29 Table 3 List of microalgae derived products and co-products Sl. no.

The friction and collision gener- ated between the beads shear the outer membrane of microalgae cells thereby extracting intracellu- lar lipids and other compounds. The efficiency of this method depends on bead size biomass con- centration temperature agitation speed and time Roux et al. 2017 . Bead milling is considered as the most efficient membrane disruption technique but it is highly energy intensive and hence chal- lenging to scale up Dong et al. 2016 . b Ultrasound assisted extraction This method uti- lised ultrasonic waves ranging from 20 to 50 kHz which damage the cells and allows mass transfer to the external system supporting extraction of lipids. Mostly horn and bath sonicators are used to disrupt cells by ultrasound. Ultrasound waves can disrupt cell structure by two mechanisms viz. cavitation and acoustic streaming. Cavitation is the growth and collapse of microbubbles caused by alternate cycle of high and low pressure during sonication of liquid cultures while acoustic streaming accelerates proper mixing Khanal et al. 2007 . Localised heat shocks are generated by transient cavitation which creates pressure on cells to rupture the outer membrane Brujan et al. 2001 . The process of ultra-sound assisted lipid extraction proves to be less time con- suming and generates relatively low temperatures as compared to microwave or autoclave assisted extrac- tion processes thereby preventing thermal denatura- tion of bioactive molecules Kumar et al. 2015 . c Microwave assisted extraction Microwave assisted extraction of lipids was first reported in 1980s from seed soil and food Ganzler et al. 1986 and was found to be more efficient and economical than other conventional methods. Microwaves are electromag- netic radiation of frequency from 0.3 to 300 GHz which can generate intracellular heat and pressure resulting in formation of water vapour within the cells. This in turn results in electroporation effect which breaks cell membrane rendering efficient extraction of intracellular compounds from micro- algae cells Amarni et al. 2010 . The microwave assisted heating uses a non-contact heat source which can penetrate into the biomaterials interact with polar molecules like water in the biomass and heat the whole sample uniformly. The co-solvent system of ethanol and chloroform can be used for the extraction of lipids mediated by microwave. Biodiesel Microalgae is categorised as 3rd generation feedstock for biodiesel production. As compared to other energy crops apparatus Mahmood et al. 2017 . The authors in this study reported that lipid extraction by renew- able bio-based solvents was more efficient as com- pared to petroleum derived solvents like hexane. The solvent polarity plays a key role in the lipid extraction process. The combination of polar and non- polar solvents improves the efficiency of lipid extraction as the polar solvents can penetrate cell wall and making intracellular non polar lipids available to the non-polar solvents Li et al. 2014 . b Supercritical CO2 extraction The super critical sol- vent extraction generally uses CO2 as solvent under varied extraction pressure and temperature and yields solvent free crude lipid Taher et al. 2014 . Tang et al. 2011 reported yield of 33.9 of lipids extracted from Schizochytrium limacinum using supercritical CO2 and under the optimum conditions of tempera- ture 40 °C and pressure 35 MPa. Optimization of the parameters of supercritical CO2 extraction process is essential as it affects the yield of lipid extraction which varies among different microalgae strains. c Ionic solvent extraction Ionic liquids ILs are salt solutions containing an organic cation and an inorganic anion which are liquid at temperature range of 0 140 °C. ILs are non-flammable and have no detectable vapour pressure which makes them pollution free Kumar et al. 2017 . The ionic solvent liquid extractions are favourable method for the extraction of microalgal lipid because of their non-volatility and thermal stability. Ionic liquid-methanol mixture shows the higher extrac- tion efficiency. The dipolarity of the ionic liquid impacts the extraction yield and serves as green solvent for the lipid extraction from microalgal lipid Kim et al. 2012 . Salvo et al. 2011 has reported a single step process of lipid extraction using IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium which lyse the microalgal cells forming an upper hydrophobic lipid phase. Hydrogen bond acidity and polarity of ILs are the key parameters that need to be consid- ered for efficient lipid extraction from microalgae Kim et al. 2012 . The solvent free method such as supercritical CO2 extraction might be clean and promising approach for more yield of lipid but remain at the laboratory scale. The solvent extrac- tion methods are used commercially with com- paratively higher yield of lipid than mechanical methods Kumar et al. 2015 . B Mechanical methods of lipid extraction a Bead Milling This method utilised small glass beads with agitation to disrupt the cell microalgae 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 15 of 29 378 microalgae have higher growth rate high lipid content and can be cultivated in non-arable land. These advantages have attracted microalgae as the most potential feedstock for bio- diesel in recent times. The methods of conversion of lipid or oil into biodiesel can be categorised as esterification trans- esterification and interesterification Sandoval et al. 2017 . a Esterification Non-edible oils waste cooking oil and animal fats are some of the biodiesel feedstock which contain high free fatty acid FFA content. FFA con- tent can be quantified by titration based methods where oils are hydrolyzed by solvents ethanol diethyl ether and titrated against alcoholic KOH solution. The value is expressed as fatty acids or as acid number mg KOH g . Individual FFA can also be determined by gas or liquid chromatography after its conversion to methyl esters. These FFA can be converted to esters by esterification reaction in the presence of methanol and strong acid catalyst as shown below. The esters thus formed can be subsequently used to produce biodiesel fatty acid methyl ester by alkaline transesterification process Mathimani et al. 2015 . Esterification reaction R1 alkyl group of fatty acid chain C O R1 OH + CH3OH R1 OCH3 O + H2O Cat. b Transesterification This is the most commonly and widely used process for biodiesel production. Transes- terification reaction basically converts high molecular weight triglycerides into three molecules of esters and glycerol in the presence of excess alcohol and catalyst acid or base . It is a series of reaction where one ester is transformed into another by the interchange of the alkoxy moiety. This reaction is reversible hence addi- tion of excess alcohol is required to shift the reaction equilibrium towards product side. Due to low cost and higher reactivity methanol is preferred for this reac- tion but other alcohols such as ethanol propanol amyl alcohol butanol also shows good reactivity. Microalgae lipids consist of triglyceride chains which undergoes transesterification reaction in three steps yielding di- glyceride in first step followed by formation of mono- glyceride in second step and subsequently forming fatty acid methyl ester as the final product and glycerol as the byproduct in third step Thao et al. 2013 El-Sheekh et al. 2016 .The overall reaction can be represented as 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 16 of 29 c Interesterification Interesterification is an alternative route of biodiesel production which occurs in the pres- ence of simple esters such as methyl acetate instead of methanol. Fatty acid methyl ester biodiesel is the main product of this reaction along with the by-product triacetin. Triacetin acts as a blending agent in fuel with several other applications which increases its market value as compared to glycerol. Investigators found that 20 blending of triacetin to biodiesel is favourable for present IC engines. This makes overall interesterifi- cation process economically attractive and viable as compared to transesterification process. The overall interesterification reaction can be represented as The conversion of lipids to the biodiesel is affected by the reaction parameter such as alcohol lipid ratio reaction time and temperature stirring and catalyst conversion. Increase in the alcohol volume enhances the yield of the biodiesel. Simi- larly the reaction temperature and time remains directly pro- portional to the biodiesel yield. The catalyst such as strong acid H2SO4 drives the reaction forward and increase the rate of reaction Thao et al. 2013 Cao et al. 2013 . The choice of catalyst is based on the free fatty acid FFA con- tent of the lipid. The recovery of biodiesel is an important step after the transesterification. The biodiesel produced can be dissolved in hexane whereas glycerol is miscible in water thus the addition of hexane and water to the reaction mixture forms two layers. Upper layer contains biodiesel dissolved in hexane whereas excess alcohol glycerol and other impurities gets separated with water at bottom layer. Repeated water wash is given to biodiesel till its pH becomes neutral to remove catalyst molecules from the biodiesel Mathimani et al. 2015 El-Shimi et al. 2013 . The addi- tion of hexane along with the reaction mixture significantly increases the yield of biodiesel as post transesterification the biodiesel synthesised gets dissolved in hexane and facilitates the recovery of biodiesel Sánchez et al. 2012 Dianursanti et al. 2015 . Transesterification of triglycerides in the presence of methanol and catalyst results in the production of bio- diesel and glycerol as the byproduct. Glycerol forms the major byproduct of biodiesel industries which remains in its crude form. Pure glycerol has intensive applications in food pharma cosmetic and polymer industries but indus- trial crude glycerol contains many contaminants and requires multiple purification steps to make it suitable to be used in product based industries. Bioconversion of this waste glyc- erol to numerous value-added products can be a possible source of additional revenue and financial viability and sus- tainability for biodiesel industry. Pigments and vitamins Microalgae are rich source of nutrition and can be consid- ered as bio-based crop for future Draaisma et al. 2013 . Microalgae derived pigments have wide applications in vari- ous industries including pharmaceutical cosmetic food and nutraceutical. These photosynthetic pigments can be catego- rised into three major classes viz. chlorophylls phycobilins and carotenoids xanthophylls and carotenes . Chlorophylls and carotenoids are hydrophilic while phycobilins are hydro- phobic and are fat-soluble. Various environmental factors effect production efficiencies of microalgae pigments such as light temperature salinity pH metal stress nutrient sup- plement and limitation Verma et al. 2009 . Various spectral portions of light such as blue-red red-far red blue-green green red and blue red act as photo-morphogenic signals and directly effects pigment composition in microalgae Kagawa et al. 2007 . Light intensity stimulates pigment accumulation in microalgae. Cyanobacteria prefers low light intensities and hence favours the production of phyco- biliproteins Pagels et al. 2019 whereas Spirulina produces higher phycoerythrin and phycocyanin under higher light 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 17 of 29 378 intensity 135 mmolphotons m2 sec Madhyastha et al. 2007 . Similarly carotenoids such as β-carotene and asta- xanthin content in Dunaliella salina and Haematococcus pluvialis respectively is highly enhanced by increasing the light intensity Pisal et al. 2005 . This was interpreted by various authors that intense illumination results in excess photo oxidation leading to oxidative stress thereby generat- ing oxygen radicals which in turn increase the production of pigments Salguero et al. 2003 . Microalgae like Haematococcus pluvialis Chlorella vul- garis Dunaliella salina and the Spirulina platensis are being cultivated for vitamin extraction. Microalgae pigments like carotenoids chlorophyll and phycobilliproteins can be used as precursors of vitamins Paolicelli et al. 2011 . Spirulina sp. is rich in carotenoid pigments which act as precursors for vitamin A and can be extracted with the help of organic solvents after saponification of algal biomas with ethanolic KOH Mathimani et al. 2018 . Provitamin such as alpha tocopherol phylloquinone gamma-tocopherol retinol can- thaxanthin phytofluene and lutein can be extracted from Tetradesmus obliquus by supercritical fluid extraction with the use of CO2. Edelmann et al. 2019 extracted riboflavin niacin folate and vitamin B12 form commercial microal- gae powder. Riboflavin and niacin were extracted with acid water whereas folate and vitamin B12 were extracted with extraction buffer. Although algae being major reservoir of vitamins and pro-vitamins more than 90 of commercial- ised β-carotene is produced through chemical synthesis. Vitamins and pigments are high value products which can add surplus revenue to the biorefinery concept. Therefore detailed evaluation of the factors extraction procedures and reactor configuration is very much essential for commercial production of microalgae pigments and vitamins within a biorefinery approach. Proteins Microalgae also serve as the source of essential amino acids for human nutrition and can benefit in fighting malnutrition and other health issues Edelmann et al. 2019 Raja et al. 2007 . Proteins from microalgae are extracted through enzy- matic hydrolysis and chemical extractions. Some new tech- niques assisted by microwave and ultrasound pulsed electric fields are also applied for extraction of proteins Christaki et al. 2011 . The algal protein extracted chemically with acid or alkali treatment is precipitated by centrifugation or by three phase partitioning TPP . Few process utilised a com- bination of two three methods such as acid base treatment followed by ultrasound. Kadam et al. 2017 . Ultrasound mediated protein extraction generates cavitation at liquid solid interface which exerts pressure on the microalgae cells and force them to break out. The extraction with deionized water allow cell lysis by osmotic shock and eases the protein extraction from the algal cell whereas the enzymatic extrac- tion uses polysaccharidase to extract the proteins from algal cells. The protein extraction from algal species is greatly affected by pH of extraction medium. The isoelectric point of proteins 6 enhances the protein solubility and stability subsequently enhancing crude protein yield from microalgae Soto-sierra et al. 2018 . The low cost feasible technique for efficient protein extraction can be mediated by simple stir- ring or ultrasonication followed by three phase partitioning Chia et al. 2019 . The protein extraction from microalgal cells is also affected by the pretreatment method applied for rupturing of cells via autoclave sonication and high pressure homogenization Parimi et al. 2015 . Other products Microalgae biomass has also been explored extensively for production of various other biobased products that can add value to the algae biorefinery model. Microalgae biomass are rich in various biomolecules such as proteins vitamins lipid minerals and pigments which can provide essential nutritional value to animal or aqua feed. It therefore acts as a potential alternative which has the ability to replace fish oil or feed thus driving towards sustainable aquacul- ture. Apart from providing nutrition microalgae biomass also acts as immunostimulant thereby improvising immu- nity of aquatic animals Shah et al. 2018 Charoonnart et al. 2018 . Several authors have studied the application of vari- ous microalgae strains in aquaculture such as Chlorella vul- garis Arthrospira platensis Ascochloris spp. Phaeodacty- lum tricornutum Pakravan et al. 2017 Sharma et al. 2019 Sorensen et al. 2016 . Microalgae based biofertilizer is another product that could be channelized in the microalgae biorefinery approach to validate zero waste circular bioeconomy concept. Apart from the key bioactive compounds microalgae biomass contains high NPK content making it suitable as organic manure or biofertilizer with a potential to replace the cur- rent chemical fertilizers. Recently Khan and co-authors have studied biofertilizer potential of Chlorella minutissima and concluded to contain 1.15 P 5.87 N and 0.28 K which is better than available organic fertilizers Khan et al. 2018 . Moreover application of algal biomass as manure to soils would not result in volatilization of nitrogen as ammonium or loss due to leaching as only 5 of algal nitrogen is avail- able as mineral N Khan et al. 2018 . Other key products that has been explored by various authors are bioethanol biohydrogen DHA which has been detailed in Table 3. Products from delipidified microalgae residue Lipid extraction from microalgae biomass is an inten- sive process which generates surplus amounts of residual 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 18 of 29 biomass which is termed as delipidified microalgal residue DMR . Although lipid is completely extracted from these residues but it still acts as a rich source of carbohydrates proteins minerals and other essential elements that could be precisely utilised for development of sustainable algal bio refinery. High market price of biodiesel could be counter- poised by adding revenue from other co-products produced from by-products of the process such as DMR. Effective use of DMR for energy recovery and other value added compounds would justify the sustainability of microalgal biorefinery approach. DMR has been reported to be an excel- lent feedstock for production of biofuels such as biohydro- gen biomethane and bioethanol. It is also a promising raw material for biopolymer production. In this section we have reviewed the potential of DMR to energetic and other value added compounds considering their potential to improve the economics of the microalgal biorefinery from wastewater. Biohydrogen After lipid recovery DMR is still a rich source of carbo- hydrates and proteins which acts as organic substrate for various hydrogen producing microbes. DMRs undergo harsh oil extraction process and hence are expected to be directly converted to hydrogen or other fuels. But recent studies have showed that DMRs require pretreatment to make the cellular carbon accessible to microbial flora for production of H2 or methane. Studies also proved that pretreatment procedures like chemical mechanical and thermochemical are benefi- cial for improved H2 production from DMRs. Yang et al. 2011a b investigated various pretreatment methods on DMR of Scenedesmus and concluded that thermo-alkaline pretreatment at 100 °C and 8 g L NaOH resulted in a three- fold increase in the yield of H2 to 45.54 mL g-volatile solid VS . Pretreatment resulted in improved solubilisation of carbohydrates and proteins ranging from 38 to 49 and 28 to 58 respectively. Subhash and Mohan 2014 have reported biohydrogen production from DMB of mixed microalgae using acidogenic consortia of bacteria. They have utilised untreated and acid treated extract slurry and solid DMR to achieve specific hydrogen yields of 4.9 3.3 3.0 and 2.4 mol kg COD of DMR extract slurry solid and untreated DMB respectively. Maurya et al. 2016 have reviewed the entire process and reported various strategies to valorize de-oiled algal biomass in order to shape a sustainable algal biorefinery. Biomethane Biomethane is a major component of biogas which is pro- duced by anaerobic digestion of organic wastes. The effi- ciency of biogas production from organic waste depends on the C N ratio of the feedstock. DMR has high C N ratio which makes it suitable for growth of methanogenic microbes for production of high methane content biogas. Numerous studies have been reported on biomethane pro- duction from microalgal biomass including deoiled biomass Bohutskyi et al. 2015 Cheng et al. 2016a b Quinn et al. 2014 Kinnunen et al. 2014 Zhao et al. 2014 . These authors have optimised various process parameters for methane pro- duction from deoiled biomass of different algal strains such as Nannochloropsis salina Auxenochlorella protothecoides Chlorella variabilis Chlorella sorokiniana. These studies resulted in enhanced biomethane production with a yield ranging from 140 to 380 ml CH4 g-volatile solids. Biom- ethane has a high calorific value and can add value to the biorefinery process. Biogas containing 70 methane could be directly used for cooking thermal and lightning purposes. This makes it a promising value added product of microalgae biorefinery. Bioethanol Recently bioethanol has gained enormous exposure due to attractive government policies demanding for blending of ethanol with gasoline ranging from 15 E15 to 85 E85 . Although a variety of feedstocks are available but majority of current bioethanol supplies are from corn and sugarcane which are food crops and hence they are termed as first gen- eration biofuels. Bioethanol production from food crops is not favourable since this may result in food shortages and price hikes particularly in a developing nation like India. This has paved the way towards search for alternate sources as feedstock in order to reduce the operational cost. Reports on bioethanol production from algal biomass are available and delipdified biomass which is a byproduct of algal indus- tries acts a potential source for bioethanol production. After lipid extraction the left over biomass is rich in complex sugars in the form of carbohydrates which can be hydro- lyzed to simple sugars by saccharification. The sugar hydro- lyzates are fermented with the most commonly used yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce ethanol Alam et al. 2019 Kim et al. 2020a b . Enzymatic hydrolysis of raw or pretreated DMR has resulted in sugar yields ranging from 37 to 43 w w Pancha et al. 2016 . Bioethanol yield from DMR after saccharification and fermentation has been reported by various researchers which range from 0.14 to 0.26 g g DMR Cheng et al. 2016a b Mirsiaghi et al. 2015 Goo et al. 2013 Lam et al. 2014 . Biopolymer Delipidified biomass acts as an excellent source for biopoly- mers such as polyhydroxybutyrate PHB polyhydroxyal- kanoate PHA which has attracted a great deal of attention 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 19 of 29 378 due to their biodegradability chemical-diversity biocom- patibility and their production from renewable carbon resources. Kumar et al. 2020 reported production of 0.43 g PHB g dry cell weight. The current methods for commercial production of PHA PHB utilise pure strains defined medium under aseptic conditions which adds to the overall cost of the process thereby increasing the market price. The production cost can be reduced by utilising feedstock which are cheaper and renewable. DMR contains surplus amounts of complex polysaccharides like cellulose starch and other nutrients. Studies are reported on application of pretreatment methods physical chemical thermal and enzymatic that breaks the complex molecules into simple easy to hydrolyze sugars. These simple molecules can be utilised by pure or mixed microbial cultures for production of biopolymers. Pure cul- tures belonging to species Pseudomonas Acaligenes Azo- tobacter Bacillus and Cupriavidus necator has the ability to convert organic sugars to PHA PHB and accumulate intra- cellularly. Mixed cultures obtained from activated sludge wastewater streams household garbage municipal solid waste etc. acts as a good source of inoculum and substrate for accumulation of intracellular biopolymers Salehizadeh et al. 2004 . Various reports have been reported for produc- tion of biopolymers PHA PHB by using DMR derived sug- ars Kumar et al. 2018a b Chandra et al. 2019 . Apart from bacterial species few microalgae and cyanobacteria species also have the ability to accumulate PHA PHBs intracellu- larly such as Chlorella fritschii Scenedesmus almeriensis Phaeodactylum tricornutum Neochloris oleobundans and Calothrix scytonemicola. Another approach of bioplastic production is by blending raw or deoiled microalgae bio- mass with other bio or petroleum based polymers or addi- tives Cinar 2020 . Other products Delipidified algae biomass are the left over residue generated after extensive solvent treatment of raw algae biomass to extract lipid. The utilisation of deoiled biomass is essential in order to successfully implement the zero waste biorefin- ery approach. After the lipid is extracted algae biomass still contains some amount of polysaccharides proteins and other essential elements which defines its potential to be used in aqua and animal feed. Reports suggest that deoiled biomass of Haematococcus pluvialis when fed to shrimps showed high growth rate and low feed conversion ratio as compared to the control Ju et al. 2012 . In another study Patterson and et al. replaced 10 of fish meal with defatted algae biomass based on Navicula sp. and Nannochloropsis salina and observed no significant reduction in growth rate of Red drum fish as compared to control diet Patterson et al. 2013 Shah et al. 2018 . Another possible utilisation of defatted algae biomass is its application as biofertilizer. It has been used as a replacement of chemical fertilizer for the growth of Zea mays L and also reported to improve the organic carbon of barren soil Maurya et al. 2016 . Apart from this delipidified biomass can be converted to syngas bio-oil and bio-char through thermochemical conversion process such as gasification and pyrolysis Bui et al. 2016 . Challenges and recent developments Microalage biorefinery has received enormous limelight in recent times. Significant advantages have been identified in the microalgal biorefinery approach and its integration into the circular bioeconomy. Apart from the developments and increased popularity it has come across various bottlenecks. The main issue lies in downstream processing that accounts for 40 of the total cost mainly due to impossibility of simultaneous recovery of multiple products of microalgal biorefinery. In recent times algae have been proved to be a promising source for transportation fuels like biodiesel bioethanol and biohydrogen. It serves as an economical feedstock and hence algae cultivation has gained attention in recent times. However it has various limitations which arise in respect of product recovery scaling up extraction methods viability of large scale harvesting methods and energy consumption. Conventional methods of extraction have various limitations with the selection of appropriate solvents for efficient extraction of value added products from microalgae biomass. The selected solvent should not only provide high yield of products but also need to be economi- cal and environmental friendly. This has been overcome by introduction of various new technologies such as microfiltra- tion and ultrafiltration for proficient extraction of high value products from microalgae. In addition the algae cultivation should adhere to the regulations set by the Food and Drugs Administration FDA agency in order to ensure the safety of the use of algae extract for human consumption. Large scale cultivation of microalgae are constrained by various other challenges among which the major hurdles we would like to discuss are Low productivity of microalgae biomass High cost of cultivation and harvesting techniques Contamination of biological pollutants Purification of high value products To increase the productivity of microalgae biomass few strategies could be considered. In this review we recom- mend using wastewater as the nutrient source for mass cul- tivation of microalgae in order to develop a cost effective process. Further use of native microalgae species which is acclimatised in wastewater are found to produce maxi- mum biomass and lipid content along with efficient nutrient 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 20 of 29 removal Chen et al. 2015 . Mixed cultures microalgae are more favourable over monocultures in terms of high bio- mass higher nutrient removal from wastewater making it a more cost effective and easy to operate process Chen et al. 2015 . Another approach to improve productivity is mutagenesis or genetic engineering of native species of microalgae. Random mutagenesis of microalgae native strains have shown to improve biomass yields in Nannochlo- ropsis oceanica by 19 . Similarly screening of high cell density HCD strains after insertional mutagenesis followed by continuous subculture resulted in HCD strains showing 50 to 100 higher biomass yield as compared to the wild variants Bosnjakovic et al. 2020 Thung et al. 2018 . Various cultivation and harvesting techniques of micro- algae biomass have been discussed in detail in the previous sections of this review. Further Table 2 provides a compara- tive discussion of various cultivation and harvesting meth- ods. Although each method has its own pros and cons but from this review we can conclude that open raceway pond is more favourable for wastewater based large scale cultivation of microalgae biomass under non-sterile conditions. How- ever the conventional paddlewheel design can be optimised and upgraded to achieve high biomass productivity. Chen and co-authors have recommended a two-stage cultivation strategy with a nutrient-sufficient and a nutrient-limited stage to enhance simultaneous production of biomass and lipid content. Another approach to boost biomass yields is to consider mixotrophic cultivation a combination of pho- totrophic and heterotrophic cultures. This type of cultiva- tion not only minimises the production costs but also results in higher biomass production due to high conversion ratios of sugars to lipid by the heterotrophic cultures Zhou et al. 2012 Chen et al. 2015 . Similarly efficient and low cost harvesting techniques need to be considered for an economical algal biorefinery. The previous sections of this review have discussed various harvesting techniques and their advantages and disadvan- tages have also been listed in Table 2. Although centrifu- gation and filtration are widely used methods to harvest microalgae biomass at commercial level but these meth- ods add to the overall cost of production. An alternative to these methods is the advanced flocculation methods such as bio-flocculation by using genetically modified microbial strains which needs to be further investigated in order to develop an efficient symbiotic consortia that can help in improved sedimentation of algal biomass. Bio-flocculation is a low cost and environment friendly technique Bosnjako- vic et al. 2020 . Co-culture of algae-bacteria or algae-fungi have boosted algae biomass yields and lipid content. Co- culture of Chlorella vulgaris and bacteria Mesorhizobium sangaii resulted in formation of large flocs which settle down easily and can be harvested efficiently Wei et al. 2020 . This method resulted in 1.5 times higher biomass yield as compared to pure algal culture. Microalgae Chlorella soro- kiniana formed flocs with bacterial cultures Comamonas flocculans Melaminivor jejuensis which showed greater sedimentation rates. This resulted in improved biomass pro- ductivity of 102.25 0.35 mg L day while productivity with pure algal culture is only limited to 78.00 3.89 mg L day Kim et al. 2020a b . Another major hurdle which impedes mass production of microalgae biomass is contamination by biological pol- lutants. Large scale cultivation of microalgae in open ponds takes place under non-sterile conditions and hence very much prone to contamination by other microbes such as bacteria fungi zooplanktons or protozoa which lives in a symbiotic system. Grazing of zooplanktons mostly ciliates can clear up dense culture of microalgae species Dunaliella salina in 2 days. Bacterial species of Bacillus Pseudomonas Flavobacterium having lytic activity can destroy microalgae cells either via direct cell-to cell contact or by secretion of extracellular toxic compounds Wang et al. 2013 . Ciliated protozoa Colpoda steinii is another predator species which can clarify cyanobacterial cultures of Synechocystis sp. in 3 days. This predator species can form highly resilient cysts which acts as a major threat to Synechocystis cultivation. Therefore researchers have shown that cultivation of Syn- echocystis under non-sterile condition is possible only if carried out under partial anoxic environment which highly inhibits growth of Colpoda steinii Troschl et al. 2017 . The challenges imposed by biological pollutants can be over- come by considering few approaches to control them Wang et al. 2013 . Filtration with silk mesh or net is one approach to remove large size cells of protozoa or zooplanktons. Chemical additives such as ammonia formaldehyde pes- ticides and hydrogen peroxide can be used for disinfecting the microalgae cultures. Another alternative proposed by some researchers is the optimization of growth conditions like temperature pH salinity light etc. which promotes microalgae growth and inhibits proliferation of biological pollutants. The microalgae biorefinery approach utilise microalgal biomass for the production of biofuels and many value added products. These value added products need to be in highly pure form and hence it undergoes a number of purification steps to obtain a product with desired market value. This in turn lowers the final yield and also add up to the processing cost. Process integration in order to reduce the purification steps can be considered to reduce the processing cost. Several other challenges that need to be considered are growth rate and stability of microalgae cultures market potential of various products product loss due to degra- dation of light or temperature sensitive compounds like pigments. Complete utilisation of all residues and waste streams to some or other value added application or prod- ucts is essential to generate revenue in order to make the 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 21 of 29 378 entire process economical. Lastly in order to evaluate the sustainability of the biorefinery approach life cycle assess- ment along with economics of all the proposed products of the biorefinery need to be carried out. In conclusion more efforts should be performed to reduce product loss and mini- mise energy costs while heading towards an environmental friendly large scale downstream processing for the extraction of high value compounds from microalgae. Techno economic feasibility of the microalgae based biorefinery model Any new process or technology developed in a bio-based economy will be feasible if it answers these questions in positive a. Is the developed technology feasible i.e. all the intermediate production steps from substrate to end-product are feasible b. Is it economically sustainable and profitable i.e. the products developed are produced at a lower value than its selling price c. Is it environmentally friendly and sustainable i.e. the developed technology has environmen- tally acceptable and friendly impact and is not harmful to the environment at any level Thomassen et al. 2018 . Biorefineries these days are looking for valorising mul- tiple products out of a single biomass feedstock to pursue circular bio economy and zero waste processes. Since micro- algae being a potential substrate for biofuels such as biom- ethane biohydrogen biodiesel and bioethanol owing to its capability of higher fixation of CO2 high biomass growth rate ability to store carbon in form of carbohydrates and lipid and different value added products viz. carbohydrates pigments proteins and biopolymers has led the attention towards the possibility of a microalgae based biorefinery Suali and Sarbatly 2012 Banu et al. 2020 . Moreover due to high protein content microalgal biomass can be used as aquafeed animal feed and poultry feed Ozcimen et al. 2016 Sharma et al. 2019 . Upstream and downstream approaches are two phases of a microalgal biorefinery. Some processes have been devel- oped for employment of microalgae for biofuels and its derived products that would expand the commercial market for microalgae derived products and will speed up the inte- gration of microalgae into mainstream biorefinery option Lopez Barreiro et al. 2014 . The rising idea of circular bioeconomy as a necessary factor in the currently devel- oped technologies applies to microalgae based processes also and therefore need to be critically reviewed before commercialization. At first microalgae biorefinery looks a promising approach in order to replace a lot of chemical based processes and products including fuels however a key drawback of producing biofuels and other derived value added products from microalgae is high production costs and economically unfeasible prices Show et al. 2015 Dasan et al. 2019 . Though microalgae have higher yield per unit area its growth rate and quality i.e. its biochemical composition in low-cost open cultivation systems vary rapidly due to vari- ation in the environmental parameters based on their taxo- nomical classes and species Fu et al. 2019 . Therefore a wide range of closed photobioreactors have been developed which are preferred over open cultivation systems for attain- ing maximum productivity with minimum risk of culture crashing. However most of the photobioreactors developed are still economically unfeasible for production of low-value end products from microalgae Hallenbeck et al. 2016 . Moreover high energy input is required during cultivation harvesting and drying steps leading to requirement of low- cost photobioreactors and downstream processes for achiev- ing feasible and economic microalgae based biofuels and value added products extraction system Dasan et al. 2019 . However microalgae despite showing huge potential and being studied for more than five decades there are only few corporations and industries involved in its commercial scale cultivation majorly due to high capital and operational expenses. Techno-economic analysis from cradle to gate is a potential means for having clarity on research priorities and estimating the economic and environmental feasibility of microalgae productions. Various researchers have per- formed techno-economic approaches for microalgae based production systems. Since most of the studies conclude that biodiesel obtained from microalgae is economically not fea- sible researchers are now focussing on the viability of multi product biorefinery exploring the possibility of concurrent production of biofuels along with other value added prod- ucts from microalgae Ramalingam and Sen 2020 . Differ- ent scenarios basic intermediate advanced and alternative of microalgae based production systems were developed by Thomasen et al. 2016 for producing 170 tonnes of microal- gae annually. Microalgae production pathways were ranged from a base case using commercially available technolo- gies to an improvised case with novel modern innovative processes. Open systems were considered for microalgae production in basic and intermediate scenarios while pho- tobioreactors were considered in advanced and alternative scenarios. Economic analysis revealed that capital expendi- ture was 400 higher in establishment of photobioreactor facility than open ponds and only the scenarios opting for open ponds were found economically feasible. It was also observed that if the culture medium was recycled the profits can be increased up to 4 times. Thomassen et al. 2018 in another study compared the potential of microalgae biorefin- eries in Belgium and India. The study was conducted based on an environmental techno-economic assessment for micro- algae based biorefinery options in India and Belgium. It was concluded through the study that the scenario in India has 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 22 of 29 high economic stability with net present value of 40 million for a project life of 10 years while Belgium was observed to have lesser environmental impact. The critical factors observed during the study for feasibility apart from inclu- sion of a medium recycling step were β-carotene content and price algal concentration and electricity usage during upstream processes. Identification of such factors lead to guidance in technology development and reduces the time for establishment of microalgae biorefineries. Microalgae plant was designed to produce Chlorella vul- garis using 227 million L d 1 wastewater and later produc- ing bio-oil from the microalgae Juneja and Murthy 2017 . 28 211 tonnes of microalgae and 10 million L should be produced from the designed plant at the capital expenditure of 105 million and operating expenditure would be 17.88 million. An interesting observation during this study was the emission of green house gases during biodiesel production was 6.2 times lesser as compared to conventional diesel. Sensitivity analysis revealed that lipid content and plant size are two critical parameters in determining the price of biodiesel. An extensive comparative study was conducted at Uni- versity of Aveiro UA Portugal and National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL USA to determine the sustain- ability of different conversion pathways and establish an integrated algal biofuels production model supported by both UA and NREL Dutta et al. 2016 . Processing technolo- gies assesses were solvent extraction transesterification and purification for biodiesel UA and fermentation distillation and hydrodeoxygenation for renewable diesel NREL . Min- imum fuel selling price were found to be 10.55 GGE gas- oline gallon equivalent for UA and 4.35 GGE for NREL case study. This analysis proved the significance of valori- zation of co-products leading to addition of revenue there by reducing the final fuel selling price. It also showed that cultivation of microalgae contributes towards 50 of emis- sions and biofuels processing technology of UA requires upgradation to achieve optimum results. The lipid extraction process has extreme issues leading to major contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and therefore stresses upon the recovery of solvent so as to reduce the emissions. Due to economic and technical uncertainties hovering over microalgae based biorefineries it is necessary to study the extent of impact of each critical parameter. Brownbridge et al. 2014 performed a global sensitivity analysis using high dimensional model representation method. The order of sensitivity for biodiesel production cost to critical input parameters is as follows algal lipid content annual areal microalgal productivity production capacity of plant car- bon price increase rate. It was also observed that return on investment is extremely sensitive to microalgal lipid content as compared to other parameters considered in the study. Biodiesel cost for a large scale plant having annual capacity for 1 00 000 tonnes biodiesel was found to be in range of 0.8 1.6 per kg. Barlow et al. 2016 showed similar results of sensitivity analysis proving algal productivity to be the most critical parameter for biodiesel fuel price. It also showed that use of wastewater for microalgae cultivation significantly reduced the environmental issues and reduced the cost of nutrient media to an extent. Xin et al. 2016 also carried out microalgae cultivation in photobioreactor facility using wastewater and cost of microalgal biomass was estimated to be 0.33 kg which was significantly lower as compared to microalgae produced through commercial media in terms of operational expenditures. Technical and economic feasibility of photobioreactor based microalgae cultivation facility for annual production of 37.85 million litres of biofuels was performed by Batan et al. 2016 . It was observed that 63 of total investment was shared by operational expenditures followed by 30 of capital investment and 7 land cost. Among the direct capital expenditures maximum share of 33 and 32 is represented by harvesting and lipid extraction systems respectively. 30 of direct capital investment is shared by cultivation systems and its accessories such as CO2 supply utility supply system pumps and pipelines. Indirect capital expenditures include warehouse office spaces contingency and land costs contributed upto 50 of total direct and indi- rect capital expenditures. Hydrotreating segment used for conversion of microalgae to biodiesel shared only 5 of capital expenditures. In operational expenditures 96 of the expenses were shared by cultivation harvesting and lipid extraction while the biodiesel hydrotreatment represented only 4 . Further breakdown of operational expenditure revealed that solvent cost for lipid extraction shares maxi- mum expense of 29 followed by 22 of nutrient and 16 of power charges. Ozcimen et al. 2018 presented two sce- narios for production of β-carotene and biodiesel from Chlo- rella vulgaris in photobioreactor system respectively. It was observed that the capital and operational expenditure were almost similar in the two scenarios however scrutinising the revenues led to the critical evaluation of importance of selling price in success of any given model. Average selling price of β-carotene was considered to be 1370 kg while biodiesel price was 0.82 kg proving that the designed sys- tem is more suitable for β-carotene production and capital investment and operating expenditures must be reduced to a significant extent in order to make biodiesel economical. Khanum et al. 2020 also proposed similar microalgal biorefinery scenarios where β-carotene was co-produced along with biodiesel and compared with a scenario where only biodiesel was produced from microalgae. Cost anal- ysis confirmed that the total investment for coproduction scenario was much higher than the scenario in which only biodiesel was produced however the revenue was hiked up to 37 million year. On the other hand only production 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 Page 23 of 29 378 of biodiesel showed loss of 345 million per unit while the co-production of β-carotene attained profit of 120.7 million per unit proving that valorization of co-products overcomes the inefficient economy resulting from a single product biorefinery. Prommuak et al. 2013 also suggested a model for coproduction of lutein along with biodiesel from Chlorella vulgaris for economic feasibility. Togarchetti et al. 2017 summarised that a each step involved has strong impact on the energy demand there by affecting the cost- economics of the whole biorefinery model b variation in microalgal productivity and location has vital role in the sustainability of the whole process. Based on the existing research work being carried out in the field of microalgae biorefinery modelling prima facie it signals towards the success of a multiproduct biorefinery model producing a bouquet of value added products using wastewater as a nutrient source will lead to a successful model for replacement of fossil based refineries and chem- ical-based products. However still a target-based approach is required to reduce the cost associated with cultivation and harvesting practices as they are the major contributors in the microalgae based processes. Dairy effluent treatment and microalgae biomass production A case study In this case study a pilot-scale high volume V-shape pond HVVP of size 2m 2m has been used for cultivation of microalgae species Ascochloris sp. ADW007 by utilising raw dairy wastewater for simultaneous production of bio- mass and treatment of dairy effluent for clean water produc- tion. This V-shaped reactor was indigenously fabricated at Sardar Patel Renewable Energy Research Institute SPRERI and was found to be more efficient then open raceway ponds in terms of higher surface to volume ratios low land foot- print and low cost Kumar et al. 2020 . This reactor has a capacity to cultivate maximum of 3000 L of culture at a time and continuous aeration is provided through poly- vinyl chloride pipes for uniform circulation and exposure of cells to light. In this study 100 raw dairy wastewater RDW is used for microalgae cultivation without any addi- tional nutritional supplements which resulted in biomass and lipid yields of 1.44 0.03 g L and 34.98 0.21 in 7 days Kumar et al. 2018a b . Apart from generation of microalgae biomass this study resulted in removal of 95.1 of COD and 92 of fluoride from RDW generating clean water which meets the standards of Indian Central Pollution Control Board Type E water designated for irrigation usage. This study was further extended by performing techno-eco- nomic analysis by considering three different scale-ups of dairy effluent generation plants viz. small 0.25 MLD medium 0.5-MLD and large 1.0-MLD over different project life times 10 20 and 30-yrs Kumar et al. 2020 . It was concluded that the 1 MLD plant considered for 20 y seemed to be most feasible in terms of 118 of internal rate of return IRR and with only 1.9 y of payback period. In this plant a calculated annual biomass production of 504 tons was achieved at 0.482 kg along with generation of approximately 240 000 m3 of treated clean water. This study Fig. 4 Schematic of the integrated process for production of microalgae biomass and other products using dairy waste water carried out at SPRERI 3 Biotech 2021 11 378 1 3 378 Page 24 of 29 also interpreted that HVVP is one of the competent micro- algae cultivation system in terms of cost and area efficiency. Apart from dairy effluent treatment this integrated process developed at SPRERI has utilised the biomass for production of lipids aquafeed and biodiesel as shown in Fig. 4 Sharma et al. 2019 . The ongoing research further targets various other products from both raw and de-lipidified algae biomass thereby satisfying a sustainable biorefinery concept. Conclusion The potential of microalgae to utilise the nutrients of waste- water enables it as a promising third generation feedstock for establishment of a sustainable and economical biorefin- ery. Use of wastewater for microalgae cultivation not only dilutes the overall cost economics but also acts as an efficient process of bioremediation. Economic assessment of current large-scale processes with a single product or two products system from microalgae deem it unfeasible. The possibil- ity of producing multiple bio-based products from a single microalgae strain has attracted the attention of researchers to optimise and streamline the material and energy balances. This review has highlighted the entire process of microalgae cultivation using wastewater and focussed on production of multiproducts from both raw and de-oiled microalgae resi- due with an approach of circular bioeconomy generating zero waste. The major products that could be targeted from raw algae biomass include lipid and biodiesel which are high volume low value products. Therefore to make algae based biorefinery more economical generation of low volume high value products is essential which includes vitamins proteins DHA carbohydrates etc. Moreover valorization of de-oiled algae residue to bio-based products provides an additional route of revenue generation within the established biore- finery. However low biomass productivity and inefficient multiproduct downstream processing techniques seem to be the major challenges that has hindered the establishment of economical microalgae biorefinery. This issues can be addressed by extensive research in producing genetically modified fast growing microalgae strains and design of simple and cost-effective downstream processing technolo- gies to reduce the overall production cost. Hence in-depth focussed investigation on few of these challenges would surely lead to commercialization of microalgae biorefinery in near future.
