AB The use of fossil fuels has faced the world with new challenges, so that
   renewable energy has become a part of the world's total energy
   consumption. Iran is rich in natural energy resources and can consider
   for using the renewable fuels like biofuels as an alternative to
   non-renewable. This study has two purposes. First, it purposes to
   provide an overview on all studies conducted in Iran in the field of
   biodiesel production from microalgae and fish waste. Second, it purposes
   to study the biodiesel production potential from those two sources in
   Bushehr province. Overall, 109 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved, of
   which 15 original articles were included. The results of the systematic
   review showed that biodiesel production research from algae and fish
   waste in Iran has increased in the last ten years. In addition, the
   minimum and maximum algae lipid content was obtained equal 17.5 and 52%,
   respectively. The lowest and highest amount of oil productivity was
   obtained equal 0.026 and 0.154 g/l.day, respectively. Also, the
   biodiesel production potential of Bushehr from aquatic algae and fish
   waste was estimated at about 196.1 kt, which is equal to 19.25% of the
   total diesel fuel requirements of Bushehr and 1.2% of the total diesel
   consumption of Iran in transportation sector. In general, the total
   revenue of $ 118.8 million from the aquatic microalgae and fish waste of
   Bushehr province can be obtained. The study concludes with biodiesel
   production policy concepts and avenues for future researches.

U2 17
AB The conclusions from life cycle assessment of algal biofuels (e.g.,
   biodiesel, renewable diesel) vary significantly due to both modeling and
   inherent technological uncertainties. The inherent uncertainties of
   US-based algal biofuels production were investigated by eliminating
   modeling uncertainty via comprehensive harmonization through a
   meta-analysis. Following harmonization, the cumulative fossil energy
   consumption (MJ/MJ), global warming potential (g CO2-eq/MJ) and water
   consumption (m3/MJ) of different algal biofuel process trains were
   investigated through a stochastic life cycle model. By focusing on the
   inherent differences of current technologies, this study identified (1)
   the differences in impact results between different process trains
   (i.e., different combinations of technology choices along the fuel
   production life cycle), (2) high impact hotspots, and (3) possible low
   impact process trains, all of which are crucial to further improve the
   sustainability of algal biofuels. The median (range) values of the three
   indicators for the most common algal biodiesel process train are 3.5
   (2.9-4.2) MJ/MJ, 99 (55-151) g CO2-eq/MJ and 0.08 (0.07-0.09) m3/MJ,
   with corresponding inter-quartile ranges being 63%, 46% and 43% less
   than the literature values, respectively. The median (range) values of
   the three indicators for the most common algae renewable diesel process
   train are 1.7 (1.4-2.2) MJ/MJ, 84 (60-112) g CO2-eq/MJ and 0.04
   (0.03-0.05) m3/MJ, with the corresponding reductions in inter-quartile
   range by 83%, 83% and 84%, respectively. Although neither of the median
   global warming potential results for algal biofuels met the mandatory
   thresholds in the Renewable Fuel Standard (45 g CO2-eq/MJ), it is
   possible to meet the requirement by integrating low impact technology
   options into the process trains.

SO Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
VL 137

U1 12
U2 137
AB As China continues to focus on renewable energy in its future
   development, the energy performance of biofuels has become a hot
   research topic. However, existing bioenergy assessments have used
   diverse indexes and inconsistent system boundaries, hindering the
   comparative analysis of different technologies. Generally, improvements
   in energy quality (e.g., from solid to gaseous fuel) are accompanied by
   increases in nonrenewable energy investment. To quantify this trade-off,
   this study examined the energy return on investment (EROI) of typical
   biomass conversion systems in China-namely, biomass compression,
   biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, biomass gasification, and biomass power
   generation. Various feedstocks were considered, including
   first-generation (e.g., corn), second-generation (e.g., corn straw), and
   third-generation (e.g., algae) feedstock options. The system boundaries
   of previous biomass footprint calculations are unified to make the
   results comparable. The results showed that converting raw biomass
   feedstock to solid fuel had the highest EROI (8.06-24.13), followed by
   biomass power (2.07-16.48), biogas (1.24-11.05), biodiesel (1.28-2.23),
   second-generation bioethanol (1.18-9.90), first-generation bioethanol
   (0.68-3.12), and biomass gasification (1.12-1.57). Compared with fossil
   fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel), biofuels had a higher average EROI,
   indicating obvious energy-saving benefits. Among all biomass conversion
   pathways, pyrolysis gasification had the highest EROI opportunity cost
   for both straw and wood residues. This study's findings highlight the
   need for consistent system boundaries in bioenergy technology deployment
   to quantify the EROI opportunity cost of each biomass conversion
   pathway, and recognize the importance of energy efficiency promotion to
   enhance the economic feasibility of biomass energy industries.

AB Algae biodiesel (BioD) and renewable diesel (RD) have been recognized as
   potential solutions to mitigating fossil-fuel consumption and the
   associated environmental issues. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been
   used by many researchers to evaluate the potential environmental impacts
   of these algae-derived fuels, yielding a wide range of results and, in
   some cases, even differing on indicating whether these fuels are
   preferred to petroleum-derived fuels or not. This meta-analysis reviews
   the methodological preferences and results for energy consumption,
   greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption for 54 LCA studies that
   considered algae BioD and RD. The significant variation in reported
   results can be primarily attributed to the difference in scope,
   assumptions, and data sources. To minimize the variation in life cycle
   inventory calculations, a harmonized inventory data set including both
   nominal and uncertainty data is calculated for each stage of the
   algae-derived fuel life cycle.

AB Our systematic review sets out the state-of-the-art of algae-specific
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs are semiconductor devices, and
   potentially the next generation of artificial illumination for
   energizing photoautotrophic algal systems. These addressable
   electroluminescence-injecting tiny bulbs render exceptional spectral and
   physicochemical properties for microalgae to grow and develop healthiest
   possible. Hence, they can enhance metabolic bioengineering of strains
   potentially capable of production of renewable bioenergy and integration
   into photobiological platforms. Thereby, the major sections of our
   meta-analytical overview go deepest possible into the development and
   implementation of specie-specific wavelengths to optimize (i) production
   of future-proof biofuels (e.g., biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas) and
   commercially valuable biomolecules (e.g., pigments, carbohydrates,
   proteins and fatty acids) to health-promoting dietary supplements and
   cosmeceuticals; (ii) biodepuration of environmental contaminants (e.g.,
   heavy metals, minerals and drug-resistant antibiotics) of emerging
   concern worldwide and biofixation of CO2; (iii) power consumption; and
   (iv) economics of narrowband colorful LEDs, relative to wideband white
   LED and fluorescence-producing technologies, primarily compact lamps.
   Our paper is timely and provides valuable knowledge on tunable
   narrowbands with particularities to photoinduction and photomodulation
   of physiological and phytochromatic mechanisms in commercially relevant
   taxonomic groups. This will open up the horizons for making cutting-edge
   science in LEDs towards an essentially provocative yet emerging concept
   of fine-scale artificial photoautotrophic algal cultivation with more
   profitability and environmental-social responsibility.

AB A meta-analysis of several published life cycle assessments of
   algae-to-energy systems was developed to better understand the
   environmental implications of deploying this technology at large scales.
   Taken together, results from these six studies seemed largely
   inconclusive because of differences in modeling assumptions and system
   boundaries. To overcome this, the models were normalized using a generic
   pathway for cultivating algae in open ponds, converting it into
   biodiesel, and processing the nonlipid fraction using anaerobic
   digestion. Meta-analysis results suggest that algae-based biodiesel
   would result in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions on par
   with terrestrial alternatives such as corn ethanol and soy biodiesel.
   Net energy ratio and normalized greenhouse gas emissions were 1.4 MJ
   produced/MJ consumed and 0.19 kg CO2-equivalent/km traveled,
   respectively. A scenario analysis underscores the extent to which
   breakthroughs in key technologies are needed before algae-derived fuels
   become an attractive alternative to conventional biofuels.

U1 12
U2 12
AB The increasing global energy demand, along with growing environmental
   concerns, has accelerated the search for renewable energy sources.
   Marine macroalgae, also known as seaweeds, have gained significant
   attention for their potential to address these challenges due to their
   rapid growth, high carbohydrate content, and absence of lignin, which
   simplifies biofuel production. This review hypothesizes that marine
   macroalgae offer a more sustainable and economically viable alternative
   to conventional biofuel sources due to their unique biochemical
   properties and ecological benefits. The objective of this review is to
   assess the potential of seaweed-based biofuels, focusing on their role
   in energy conservation, climate change mitigation, and environmental
   sustainability. The study highlights macroalgae's carbohydrates and
   lipids, essential for biodiesel and bioethanol production. A
   comprehensive analysis of macroalgae cultivation techniques and
   biorefinery processes is presented, exploring whether optimized
   processing methods can enhance biofuel yields while minimizing
   environmental impacts. Additionally, the paper now incorporates life
   cycle assessment (LCA) and meta-analysis approaches to evaluate the
   environmental and economic feasibility of macroalgae-based biofuels.
   Methods for processing macroalgae biomass are discussed. Additionally,
   the paper reviews the ecological benefits of macroalgae cultivation,
   such as carbon sequestration (CS), which helps reduce greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions and promotes marine conservation. The transition to
   sustainable energy solutions is facilitated by the insights it provides
   into agriculture and processing techniques.

AB Open raceway ponds are regarded as the most economically viable option

   bio-products, such as biodiesel. However, improvements are required
   including reducing the costs associated with harvesting biomass. There
   is now a growing interest in exploiting natural ecological processes
   within biotechnology. We review how chemical cues produced by algal
   grazers induce colony formation in algal cells, which subsequently leads
   to their sedimentation. A statistical meta-analysis of more than 80
   studies reveals thatDaphniagrazers can induce high levels of colony
   formation and sedimentation inScenedesmus obliquusand that these
   natural, infochemical induced sedimentation rates are comparable to
   using commercial chemical equivalents. These data suggest that natural
   ecological interactions can be co-opted in biotechnology as part of a
   promising, low energy and clean harvesting method for use in large
   raceway systems.

AB The objective of this study is to elucidate the economic viability of
   algae-to-energy systems at a large scale, by developing a meta-analysis
   of five previously published economic evaluations of systems producing
   algae biodiesel. Data from original studies were harmonised into a
   standardised framework using financial and technical assumptions.
   Results suggest that the selling price of algae biodiesel under the base
   case would be $5.00-10.31/gal, higher than the selected benchmarks:
   $3.77/gal for petroleum diesel, and $4.21/gal for commercial biodiesel
   (B100) from conventional vegetable oil or animal fat. However, the
   projected selling price of algal biodiesel ($2.76-4.92/gal), following
   anticipated improvements, would be competitive. A scenario-based
   sensitivity analysis reveals that the price of algae biodiesel is most
   sensitive to algae biomass productivity, algae oil content, and algae
   cultivation cost. This indicates that the improvements in the yield,
   quality, and cost of algae feedstock could be the key factors to make
   algae-derived biodiesel economically viable.

AB With their fast growth rate and ability to accumulate a high percentage
   of their weight as lipid and carbohydrate, microalgae potentially
   represent an ideal feedstock for the production of biodiesel and
   bioethanol. In addition, microalgae offer several environmental
   benefits, and do not compete with food production for land, fresh water,
   and nutrients. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to provide a
   quantitative, systematic and harmonized assessment of current bio-energy
   potential. The analysis is conducted by considering all the main steps
   in detail, from cultivation to biodiesel production, and by deriving an
   overall estimation of energy consumption for biodiesel production.
   Energy consumption uncertainty is also quantified and discussed. A
   systematic review of all the main technologies available for all the
   main processing steps towards the production of biodiesel from
   microalgae is presented, focusing on the derivation of the Net Energy
   Ratio (NER) of each combination of technologies, complemented by an
   uncertainty analysis of the data used and those obtained in the present
   work. A wide scatter in the data available in the literature has been
   identified, highlighting the need for an uncertainty analysis. If the
   average overall energy consumption per unit of biodiesel mass is
   considered, all the routes adopting a raceway pond have a lower energy
   consumption, but if the uncertainty on the overall energy consumption is
   also considered, the minimum value of the range of NER values for some
   of the routes adopting a photobioreactor is comparable to the NER value
   obtainable by using raceway ponds. Thus, the present framework proposes
   a harmonized and comprehensive methodology to compare and contrast
   technologies for the production of biodiesel from microalgae, and is
   applied in this paper to identify, with an appreciation of the
   uncertainty, the most promising combinations of technologies.

AB Purpose: Microalgae biodiesel has attracted considerable attention as a
   potential substitute for fossil fuels and biodiesel from food crops.
   Nevertheless, its reported climate impacts in the scientific literature
   vary significantly. This article describes and synthesizes the range of
   results found in the life cycle assessment (LCA) literature regarding
   microalgae biodiesel studies to investigate whether particular
   parameters, e.g. technologies, were associated with higher or lower
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions so that a best practice can be inferred
   from currently available LCA data and thereby recommended. Methods: A
   systematic literature review and meta-regression analysis (MRA) of 36
   LCA studies that report on the GHG emissions of microalgae biodiesel was
   conducted. An assessment of key aspects, including modelling choices and
   technologies, was performed. Furthermore, MRA models were formulated
   considering several variables of interest describing both technical and
   modelling choices to identify the main causes for the variability in GHG
   emissions per MJ of biodiesel. Variables chosen include: microalgae
   species; culture medium; cultivation system; source of CO2; extraction
   technology; conversion technology; system boundary; geographical scope;
   inclusion or exclusion of capital goods; and how multifunctionality was
   handled. Results and discussion: The reviewed studies altogether
   reported 308 results ranging from -0.7 to 3.8 kg CO2 eq. MJ-1biodiesel,
   portraying 19 different system configurations. Despite the comprehensive
   range of variables assessed, the models generated could not plausibly
   explain that the variability in GHG emissions depends either on the
   technologies considered or on the methodological choices adopted.
   However, the following relationships could be observed: location in
   Europe and high oil productivity were associated with lower emissions,
   whilst dry extraction should be avoided for leading to higher GHG
   emissions, on average. Conclusions: There is a large degree of
   variability within the technologies considered, as well as the
   methodological choices adopted, so that no robust conclusions could be
   drawn from the MRA. Notwithstanding, average GHG emissions reported were
   more than twice as high as fossil diesel and, while there are some
   studies showing large benefits, none of the various algae technologies
   performed consistently better than fossil diesel, questioning the
   climate-mitigation potential of microalgae biodiesel.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The presence of heavy metals, specifically
   cadmium, in the environment poses significant threats to both ecological
   systems and human health. However, microalgae have shown potential in
   addressing this issue through their ability to absorb cadmium and
   produce valuable biomass, making them a promising solution for
   bioremediation. Among the various microalgae species,Chlorella
   vulgarisstands out as a suitable candidate due to its potential for
   biodiesel production and its capacity to effectively absorb cadmium.
   Therefore, the main objective of this study is to assess the toxicity of
   cadmium onChlorella vulgariscells using network meta-analysis as a
   methodology. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted on Scopus,
   Scilit, Google Scholar, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies
   published from 1 January 1990 to 16 January 2024. Only studies that
   reported the cell number ofChlorella vulgarisas a result of cadmium
   exposure were considered for inclusion. The collected data were then
   subjected to Bayesian frequentist network meta-analysis, utilizing
   standardized mean difference and a 95 percent confidence interval as
   measures of effect size. Additionally, a linear regression analysis was
   performed to examine the dose-dependent impact of cadmium toxicity.
   FINDINGS: Dose-dependent toxic effects of cadmium onChlorella
   vulgariswere evident (R-square of more than 0.90), particularly at a
   concentration of 1 part per million, deemed as the maximum tolerable
   threshold. Prolonged exposure revealed a concentration-dependent
   reduction in cell viability, suggesting potential lifespan shortening. A
   comparison of growth stimulants, gibberellic acid and brassinolide
   (standard means differences of 1.7 and 3.8, respectively), in mitigating
   cadmium toxicity indicated the latter superior effectiveness in
   sustaining microalgal survivability. The presence of high nitrogen and
   low phosphorous levels was found to be significantly associated with a
   reduction inChlorella vulgariscells due to cadmium exposure. CONCLUSION:
   This research has provided conclusive proof of the harmful effects of
   cadmium onChlorella vulgaristhrough the implementation of Bayesian
   frequentist network meta-analysis, offering valuable insights for
   environmental management practices. The findings reveal
   concentration-dependent effects of cadmium toxicity. The survivability
   ofChlorella vulgarisis determined by the compositions of macronutrients
   nitrogen and phosphorous. Comparative analyses highlight the superior
   protective effect of brassinolide over gibberellic acid in mitigating
   cadmium toxicity. Overall, the findings highlight the potential
   ofChlorella vulgarisin both bioremediation of heavy metals and biomass
   production.

AB Increasing energy demands lead to the search for sustainable biofuels
   such as biodiesel from renewable sources such as algal biomass.
   Specially, microalgae have become increasingly popular as biodiesel
   feedstock due to their fast-growing rates and relatively high level of
   lipids. The non-catalytic transesterification reaction of microalgae oil
   under supercritical conditions in the presence of alcohols is an
   efficient process for biodiesel production and can overcome some of the
   limitations posed by subcritical catalytic transesterification. Two-step
   and one-step processes have been reported for this purpose, in the last
   case with extraction and transesterification stages being performed
   simultaneously. This works offer a systematic review using the PRISMA
   methodology analyzing the status of this research topic and identifying
   future research strategies. With this work, PRISMA methodology is
   applied for the first time within technological engineering fields.
   Moreover, this is the first specific overview on the production of
   biodiesel from microalgae under supercritical conditions. Several key
   factors such as microalgae type and operation variables including
   extraction oil, temperature and reaction time, pressure, water content
   in biomass, alcohol excess and final biodiesel properties are discussed.
   Further efforts need to be done in order to study the continuous
   biodiesel production by the development of integrated processes that
   involve both microalgae cultivation and biodiesel production.

AB Microalgae biomass has attracted great interest from researchers as a
   promising feedstock for biodiesel production. Although enormous research
   works have been carried out to identify microalgae species with high
   biomass and lipid productivities, genetic modification of strains as
   well as optimization of cultivation conditions, however, the progress is
   yet to be fully satisfied. Based on the present lipid yield and
   extraction methods, it is still not feasible to commercialize the
   microalgae biodiesel. One of the promising approaches to elevate lipid
   accumulation by microalgae is through tuning the cellular mechanisms and
   metabolic pathway by exposing microalgae cells to various abiotic stress
   environments such as nutrient starvation, high salinity level and strong
   light intensity. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis of quantitative
   influences of critical abiotic stress on both microalgae biomass and
   lipid profile is still limited in the literature. Hence, the present
   paper aims to deliver insights into selections of single and multiple
   abiotic stress factors for simultaneous enhancement of microalgae
   biomass and lipids (polar and non-polar) which could improve the
   techno-economic viability in the microalgae processing chains and
   biorefinery industries.

AB Micro-algae have received considerable interest as a potential feedstock
   for producing sustainable transport fuels (biofuels). The perceived
   benefits provide the underpinning rationale for much of the public
   support directed towards micro-algae research. Here we examine three
   aspects of micro-algae production that will ultimately determine the
   future economic viability and environmental sustainability: theenergy
   and carbon balance,environmental impactsandproduction cost. This
   analysis combines systematic review and meta-analysis with insights
   gained from expert workshops. We find that achieving a positive energy
   balance will require technological advances and highly optimised
   production systems. Aspects that will need to be addressed in a viable
   commercial system include: energy required for pumping, the embodied
   energy required for construction, the embodied energy in fertilizer, and
   the energy required for drying and de-watering. The conceptual and often
   incomplete nature of algae production systems investigated within the
   existing literature, together with limited sources of primary data for
   process and scale-up assumptions, highlights future uncertainties around
   micro-algae biofuel production. Environmental impacts from water
   management, carbon dioxide handling, and nutrient supply could constrain
   system design and implementation options. Cost estimates need to be
   improved and this will require empirical data on the performance of
   systems designed specifically to produce biofuels. Significant (>50%)
   cost reductions may be achieved if CO2, nutrients and water can be
   obtained at low cost. This is a very demanding requirement, however, and
   it could dramatically restrict the number of production locations
   available.

AB The rapidly increasing global energy demand, along with the rapid
   depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels, needs a coordinated effort to
   investigate alternate and sustainable energy sources. Biofuels generated
   from diverse biological sources, such as biodiesel, bio-ethanol,
   bio-butanol and bio-hydrogen, have emerged as similarly fascinating
   alternatives in this environment. Among them, the exploitation of
   biological wastes, notably from fish, gives a compelling alternative.
   Despite substantial studies on biodiesel production from plant, algal
   and microbial sources, there is an enormous gap in understanding
   regarding the effective conversion of fish waste into biodiesel. This
   analysis assesses the sustainability of fish waste-derived oil as a
   biofuel source, highlighting the requirement for efficient biodiesel
   manufacturing processes. Despite its environmental as well as economic
   benefits, inadequate knowledge and limited attempts to convert fish
   waste to biodiesel restrict advancement in this sector. In compliance
   with PRISMA principles, a systematic review was performed. After an
   extensive search was conducted using the databases of PubMed, Web of
   Science and Google Scholar, 200 pertinent studies were found. Once the
   inclusion criteria were applied, 15 papers were chosen for examination.
   Unrealized potential for meeting waste management and energy demands is
   revealed by the investigation of oil produced from fish waste as a
   biofuel alternative. The Physicochemical parameters that affect fish oil
   production for biodiesel waste are discovered, providing information
   regarding essential components for effective conversions. The results
   encourage further investigations into fish waste as a useful resource
   for the manufacture of bio-fuels and they are by international
   initiatives to create environmentally friendly along with renewable
   energy alternatives.

AB Recent research interest has focused on microalgae cultivation for
   biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading due to the requirement
   of high efficiency for nutrient uptake and CO2capture, with economic
   feasibility and environmental benefits. Numerous studies have suggested
   that biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading can occur
   simultaneously via microalgae-based technology. However, there is no
   comprehensive review on this technology with respect to the nutrient
   removal from biogas slurry and biogas upgrading. This article summarizes
   microalgal cultivation with biogas slurry and biogas from anaerobic
   digestion. The parameters, techniques, and modes of microalgae
   cultivation have been discussed in detail to achieve high efficiency in
   biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading. In addition, the
   evaluation of energy efficiency and safety has also been explored.
   Compared with mono-cultivation of microalgae and co-cultivation of
   microalgae and bacteria, microalgae-fungi symbiosis has demonstrated
   greater development prospect and higher energy efficiency and the energy
   consumption for pollutants and CO2removal were 14.2-39.0% . USD-1and
   19.9-23.3% . USD-1, respectively. Further, a sustainable recycling
   scheme is proposed for the purification of biogas slurry from anaerobic
   digestion process and biogas upgrading via microalgae-based technology.

AB Microalgae are a potential source of biomass for the production of
   energy, which is why the amount of research on this topic has increased
   in recent years. This work describes the state of the art of microalgae
   production from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), its potential to
   generate electricity and the scale in which it is possible. The
   methodology used was a systematic review of the gasification of
   microalgae from 49 articles selected. Based on the review, a conceptual
   scenario for microgeneration in WWTP using as feedstock microalgae for
   thermal gasification was developed. The most consistent assumptions for
   a real scale microgeneration are microalgae production in open ponds
   using domestic sewage as a nutritional medium; the use of the
   flocculation process in process of harvesting; microalgae to energy
   through thermal gasification process using a downdraft gasifier.
   Considering a WWTP with a 3000 m3/d flux capacity, 860 kg/d of dry
   microalgae biomass might be produced. For which, gasification has a
   production potential of 0.167 kWh/m3 of treated sewage, but the energy
   balance is compromised by the drying process. However, when the biogas
   produced in anaerobic treatment enter in the model, it is possible to
   add a surplus of electricity of 0.14 kWh/m3 of treated sewage. Finally,
   a cost estimate is made for the acquisition of drying and
   gasification-electricity generation systems. For this scenario, the
   results suggest that the investments may be financially returned after
   five years, with additional potential for further optimization.

AB Wheat is an important commodity in Europe. With a production of 133
   million tonnes per year and annual import and export accounting for 6.3
   and 5.3 billion US$, respectively, wheat is the most important cereal in
   Europe. Wheat cultivation further feeds into a wide variety of products
   ranging from bread, over imitation meat, to biofuels and bio-based
   materials. Therefore, it is desirable to have a synthetic life cycle
   assessment (LCA) of the impacts of an average kilogram (kg) of wheat
   produced in Europe. This article aims to provide such a synthesis using
   two strategies. In the first strategy, we give an overview of published
   LCA impacts of wheat production. A second strategy is a meta-analysis in
   which a re-evaluation is made of 20 available life cycle inventories
   representing cases in 11 different European countries. Based on the
   production shares of these countries in the total European production,
   weighted average impacts are calculated. These weighted averages of the
   re-evaluated inventories show that an average kg of wheat grain produced
   in Europe demands 3.25 megajoules of nonrenewable, fossil energy, emits
   0.61 to 0.65 kg carbon dioxide equivalents, triggers terrestrial
   acidification of 4.94 to 6.51 grams (g) sulphur dioxide equivalents,
   freshwater eutrophication of 0.08 to 0.09 g phosphorous equivalents,
   marine eutrophication of 4.97 to 7.60 g nitrogen equivalents, and
   occupies 1.63 square meter years of agricultural land. The re-evaluation
   of studies results in similar impacts as the mere reviewing of energy
   demands and global warming potentials. Given the many applications of
   wheat, the presented meta-analysis is interesting to evaluate the
   average and range of environmental performance of wheat production in
   Europe, but is also useful as an input in assessing impacts of
   wheat-based products.

U1 6
U2 62
AB Investment in biofuels, as sustainable alternatives for fossil fuels,
   has gained momentum over the last decade due to the global environmental
   and health concerns regarding fossil fuel consumption. Hence, effective
   management of biofuel supply chain (BSC) components, including biomass
   feedstock production, biomass logistics, biofuel production in
   biorefineries, and biofuel distribution to consumers, is crucial in
   transitioning towards a low-carbon and circular economy (CE). The
   present study aims to render an inclusive knowledge map of the
   BSC-related scientific production. In this vein, a systematic review,
   supported by a keywords co-occurrence analysis and qualitative content
   analysis, was carried out on a total of 1,975 peer-reviewed journal
   articles in the target literature. The analysis revealed four major
   research hotspots in the BSC literature, namely (1) biomass-to-biofuel
   supply chain design and planning, (2) environmental impacts of biofuel
   production, (3) biomass to bioenergy, and (4) techno-economic analysis
   of biofuel production. Besides, the findings showed that the following
   subject areas of research in the BSC research community have recently
   attracted more attention: (i) global warming and climate change
   mitigation, (ii) development of the third-generation biofuels produced
   from algal biomass, which has recently gained momentum in the CE debate,
   and (iii) government incentives, pricing, and subsidizing policies. The
   provided insights shed light on the understanding of researchers,
   stakeholders, and policy-makers involved in the sustainable energy
   sector by outlining the main research backgrounds, developments, and
   tendencies within the BSC arena. Looking at the provided knowledge map,
   potential research directions in BSCs towards implementing the CE model,
   including (i) integrative policy convergence at macro, meso, and micro
   levels, and (ii) industrializing algae-based biofuel production towards
   the CE transition, were proposed.

AB The sustainability integration to achieve circular economy pressures the
   development of renewable raw material and bioenergy sources, including
   marine biomass such as macroalgae. The consideration of sustainable
   conversion technology for bioenergy from macroalgae is critically
   highlighted. Various studies have been emphasized that life cycle
   assessment (LCA) can be applied to assess the efficacy and environmental
   aspects of bioenergy production from cradle-to-grave. This systematic
   review attempts to critically evaluate the development of LCA studies on
   macroalgae valorisation for bioenergy. Several online databases (i.e.,
   Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, Springer, DOAJ, and MDPI) were
   used to collect the relevant articles. Then, PRISMA (Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) method has been selected
   to screen the most recent research articles (from January 2011 to June
   2021) published in peer-reviewed international journals. The studies
   presented the development, opportunities, challenges, and future
   research for the commercialization of macroalgae as a sustainable
   feedstock for bioenergy.

AB Although the production of biofuels from microalgae has numerous
   advantages over other raw materials, its large-scale application still
   comes across economic aspects. In this context, the concept of
   biorefinery emerges as a strategy to increase the sustainability of this
   process. Studies have been developed to reduce production costs,
   especially to optimize the harvesting stage. Among the techniques used,
   bioflocculation is a promising alternative to traditional harvesting
   methods, as it is viable in terms of cost, execution and efficiency and,
   above all, it is a more environmentally appropriate method. This study
   aimed to perform a bibliometric and systematic review of traditional
   algal harvesting techniques and the mechanisms governing the different
   interactions of microorganisms used as bioflocculants, especially fungi.
   The high efficiencies of microalgae harvesting, combined with the
   possibility of cultivation in wastewater and the various bioproducts
   originated from this biomass, show the potential application of
   bioflocculation in the context of integrated biorefineries.

TI New insights into the factors influencing methanogenic pathways in
   anaerobic digesters.
SO Anaerobe
VL 91
PY 2025
U1 27
U2 27
AB Introduction: Anaerobic digestion integrates waste treatment, energy
   generation, and nutrient recycling, producing methane mainly through
   acetoclastic (AM) and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (HM). Methanogenic
   pathway management can improve biogas productivity and quality. The
   balance between pathways is influenced by environmental and
   physicochemical conditions, with conflicting results on the effect of
   different factors often reported. This systematic review aims to clarify
   the influence of various parameters on methanogenic pathways in
   anaerobic digesters. Methods: Literature search was conducted in the Web
   of Science and Scopus databases. The effects of different parameters on
   the predominant methanogenic pathway were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis
   tests and Spearman's rank correlation. Results: Thermophilic
   temperatures and high free ammonia nitrogen concentrations (>300 mg L-1)
   increase HM, with a strong combined effect of these variables.
   Conversely, under moderate temperature and ammonia concentrations, the
   primary feedstock influences the methanogenic pathway, with algae
   biomass, pig manure, and food industry wastewater showing the lowest
   contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. pH effect varied with
   temperature, with acidic and alkaline pH favoring HM in mesophilic and
   thermophilic digesters, respectively. Furthermore, higher levels of
   volatile fatty acids (>2000 mg L-1), carbohydrates (>10 g/L) and lipids
   (>10 g/L) also appeared to favor HM over AM, while most metals -
   especially Cr, Se and W - promoted AM. Conclusion: This study emphasizes
   the role of various factors in methanogenic pathway selection,
   highlighting the impact of previously overlooked parameters, such as
   inorganic elements and organic matter composition. These insights are
   essential for understanding the methanogenic pathway balance and
   optimizing biogas processes.

AB To date, feedstock resource assessments have evaluated cellulosic and
   algal feedstocks independently, without consideration of demands for,
   and resource allocation to, each other. We assess potential land
   competition between algal and terrestrial feedstocks in the United
   States, and evaluate a scenario in which 41.5*109L yr-1of
   second-generation biofuels are produced on pastureland, the most likely
   land base where both feedstock types may be deployed. Under this
   scenario, open-pond microalgae production is projected to use 1.2*106ha
   of private pastureland, while terrestrial biomass feedstocks would use
   14.0*106ha of private pastureland. A spatial meta-analysis indicates
   that potential competition for land under this scenario would be
   concentrated in 110 counties, containing 1.0 and 1.7*106ha of algal and
   terrestrial dedicated feedstock production, respectively. A land
   competition index applied to these 110 counties suggests that 38 to 59
   counties could experience competition for upwards of 40% of a county's
   pastureland, representing 2%-5% of total pastureland in the U.S.;
   therefore suggesting little overall competition between algae
   production, terrestrial energy feedstocks and alternative uses for
   existing agricultural production such as livestock grazing.

AB Microalgae, with their advantages of rapid growth, high lipid content,
   and high photosynthetic efficiency, are widely used for carbon
   neutralization and pollutant remediation. Moreover, microalgae biochars,
   derived from converting microalgae into biofuels, are also extensively
   utilized in these fields. This paper endeavors to provide a

   biochars in carbon neutralization and pollutant remediation. Given the
   growing utilization of wastewater and flue gas for cultivating
   microalgae, this review also delves into the toxic effects of different
   pollutants on microalgae. Furthermore, this review assesses the economic
   and environmental impacts of incorporating microalgae-based technologies
   into the microalgae biofuel industry, highlighting their substantial
   potential for bolstering the economic viability and sustainability of
   the industry. Finally, the challenges and future directions of these
   technologies are analyzed. This review may provide strategies for
   advancing carbon neutralization, pollutant remediation, and the
   development of the microalgae biofuel industry.

TI Systematic review on carrageenolytic enzymes: from metabolic pathways to
   applications in biotechnology.
SO Biotechnology Advances
VL 73

U1 16
U2 44
AB Carrageenan, the major carbohydrate component of some red algae, is an
   important renewable bioresource with very large annual outputs.
   Different types of carrageenolytic enzymes in the carrageenan metabolic
   pathway are potentially valuable for the production of carrageenan
   oligosaccharides, biofuel, and other chemicals obtained from
   carrageenan. However, these enzymes are not well-developed for
   oligosaccharide or biofuel production. For further application,
   comprehensive knowledge of carrageenolytic enzymes is essential.
   Therefore, in this review, we first summarize various carrageenolytic
   enzymes, including the recently discovered beta-carrageenase,
   carrageenan-specific sulfatase, exo-alpha-3,6-anhydro-D-galactosidase
   (D-ADAGase), and exo-beta-galactosidase (BGase), and describe their
   enzymatic characteristics. Subsequently, the carrageenan metabolic
   pathways are systematically presented and applications of carrageenases
   and carrageenan oligosaccharides are illustrated with examples. Finally,
   this paper discusses critical aspects that can aid researchers in
   constructing cascade catalytic systems and engineered microorganisms to
   efficiently produce carrageenan oligosaccharides or other value-added
   chemicals through the degradation of carrageenan. Overall, this paper
   offers a comprehensive overview of carrageenolytic enzymes, providing
   valuable insights for further exploration and application of these
   enzymes.

SO Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews

U2 92
AB Industries across the world are making a transition from fossil
   resources to renewable biological feedstock for the production of
   chemicals, fuels, and materials, as a strategy to promote sustainable
   development and economic growth. However, limited biomass availability
   can halt the expansion of bio-based sectors, unless alternative raw
   materials are employed and cascading uses are implemented on a large
   scale. Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) can contribute to feedstock
   diversification and improved biomass conversion efficiencies along
   supply chains, although concerns arise about their actual viability and
   competitiveness. A systematic review of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs)
   and related process-based approaches is carried out to evaluate the
   sustainability of advanced bio-based technologies, defined as those that
   use either non-food feedstock or circularity principles -or both- for
   delivering diverse products. A classification scheme is proposed to
   categorise KETs based on the feedstock employed (plant residues and
   perennials, designer crops, algae, or biological waste) or the
   underlying technological configuration (enzyme/microbial assisted
   processing or biorefineries). Results show that producing biofuels and
   biochemicals from perennial plants, lignocellulosic residues and algae
   has advantages in terms of greenhouse gas emissions relative to their
   fossil counterparts, while trade-offs occur with other environmental
   impacts and sustainability dimensions. Cradle-to-cradle systems can
   deliver additional sustainability gains, but their implementation poses
   technical and socio-political challenges. Further harmonisation of LCA
   methodologies is desirable to compare KETs in different sectoral,
   geographical and policy contexts. In spite of the diversity of outcomes
   and approaches, this review provides an overview of advanced bio-based
   technologies, while shedding light on the often overestimated
   sustainability benefits of the bioeconomy.

AB Degradation, detoxification, or removal of the omnipresent polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the ecosphere as well as their
   prevention from entering into food chain has never appeared simple. In
   this context, cost-effective, eco-friendly, and sustainable solutions
   like microbe-mediated strategies have been adopted worldwide. With this
   connection, measures have been taken by multifarious modes of microbial
   remedial strategies, i.e., enzymatic degradation, biofilm and
   biosurfactant production, application of biochar-immobilized microbes,
   lactic acid bacteria, rhizospheric-phyllospheric-endophytic
   microorganisms, genetically engineered microorganisms, and
   bioelectrochemical techniques like microbial fuel cell. In this review,
   a nine-way directional approach which is based on the microbial
   resources reported over the last couple of decades has been described.
   Fungi were found to be the most dominant taxa among the CPAH-degrading
   microbial community constituting 52.2%, while bacteria, algae, and
   yeasts occupied 37.4%, 9.1%, and 1.3%, respectively. In addition to
   these, category-wise CPAH degrading efficiencies of each microbial
   taxon, consortium-based applications, CPAH degradation-related molecular
   tools, and factors affecting CPAH degradation are the other important
   aspects of this review in light of their appropriate selection and
   application in the PAH-contaminated environment for better human-health
   management in order to achieve a sustainable ecosystem.

AB Isochrysis galbana is a subject of study for its potential application
   across different biorefinery industries, due to its biological and
   biochemical characteristics. However, the optimization of culture
   conditions and assessment of current efforts towards the scaling from
   laboratory to small to large scale are pertinent to be addressed. The
   review aims to summarize the research related to the culture of I.
   galbana, focusing on identifying the optimal parameters that improve
   growth and lipid production. In addition, small- and large-scale
   cultures and downstream processes are explored. Optimal culture
   conditions include growth on F/2 or Walne media, use of additives (e.g.,
   fertilizer, iron), 400 mol m-2 s-1 irradiance, 18:6-h light:dark
   photoperiod, 30°C temperature, 30-35 psu salinity, 7.5-8.5 pH, and 1.5%
   CO2-enrich airflow. Meanwhile, only a few studies have cultured I.
   galbana in small- and large-scale systems. Small-scale production
   results highlight the relevance of parameter optimization, as
   productivities vary across studies. Moreover, large-scale systems
   revealed high biomass and lipid productivity. Downstream processing of
   this microalgal biomass is evaluated, and centrifugation, - 80°C
   storage, enzyme inactivation, and Folch extraction methods are the
   preferred protocols. Overall, the application of novel genetic
   modification strategies holds promises for enhancing growth and lipid
   accumulation. Isochrysis galbana represents a relevant species for
   biorefinery industries; the culture under optimized conditions and
   suitable systems could greatly enhance its viability. However,
   forthcoming research in genetically engineered strains and study of the
   intra-strain variations of this species are required to completely
   assess its biotechnological potential.

TI Current knowledge and future perspectives of the use of seaweeds for
   livestock production and meat quality: a systematic review.

AB The effects of dietary macroalgae, or seaweeds, on growth performance
   and meat quality of livestock animal species are here reviewed.
   Macroalgae are classified intoPhaeophyceae(brown algae),Rhodophyceae(red
   algae) andChlorophyceae(green algae). The most common macroalga genera
   used as livestock feedstuffs are:Ascophyllum,LaminariaandUndariafor
   brown algae;Ulva,CodiumandCladophorafor green algae;
   andPyropia,ChondrusandPalmariafor red algae. Macroalgae are rich in many
   nutrients, including bioactive compounds, such as soluble
   polysaccharides, with some species being good sources of n-3 and n-6
   polyunsaturated fatty acids. To date, the incorporation of macroalgae in
   livestock animal diets was shown to improve growth and meat quality,
   depending on the alga species, dietary level and animal growth stage.
   Generally,Ascophyllum nodosumcan increase average daily gain (ADG) in
   ruminant and pig mostly due to its prebiotic activity in animal's
   gut.A.nodosumalso enhances marbling score, colour uniformity and
   redness, and can decrease saturated fatty acids in ruminant
   meats.Laminariasp., mainlyLaminaria digitata, increases ADG and feed
   efficiency, and improves the antioxidant potential of pork.Ulvasp., and
   its mixture withCodiumsp., was shown to improve poultry growth at up to
   10% feed. Therefore, seaweeds are promising sustainable alternatives to
   corn and soybean as feed ingredients, thus attenuating the current
   competition among food-feed-biofuel industries. In addition, macroalgae
   can hinder eutrophication and participate in bioremediation. However,
   some challenges need to be overcome, such as the development of
   large-scale and cost-effective algae production methods and the
   improvement of algae digestibility by monogastric animals. The dietary
   inclusion of Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes) could allow for the
   degradation of recalcitrant macroalga cell walls, with an increase of
   nutrients bioavailability. Overall, the use of macroalgae as feedstuffs
   is a promising strategy for the development of a more sustainable
   livestock production.
