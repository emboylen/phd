However, the lack of studies towards economic viability and        environmental sustainability of the entire production chain limits its        large-scale application. The use of wastewaters economizes natural        resources used for algal biomass cultivation. However, desirable biomass        characteristics for a good fuel may be impaired when wastewaters are        used, namely low lipid content and high ash and protein contents. Thus,        the choice of wastewaters with more favorable characteristics may be one        way of obtaining a more balanced macromolecular composition of the algal        biomass and therefore, a more suitable feedstock for the desired        energetic route. The exploration of biorefinery concept and the use of        wastewaters as culture medium are considered as the main strategic tools        in the search of this viability. Considering the economics of overall        process, direct utilization of wet biomass using hydrothermal        liquefaction or hydrothermal carbonization and anaerobic digestion is        recommended. Among the explored routes, anaerobic digestion is the most        studied process. However, some main challenges remain as little        explored, such as a low energy pretreatment and suitable and large-scale        reactors for algal biomass digestion. On the other hand, thermochemical        conversion routes offer better valorization of the algal biomass but        have higher costs. A biorefinery combining anaerobic digestion,        hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction processes would        provide the maximum possible output from the biomass depending on its        characteristics. Therefore, the choice must be made in an integrated        way, aiming at optimizing the quality of the final product to be        obtained. Life cycle assessment studies are critical for scaling up of        any algal biomass valorization technique for sustainability. Although        there are limitations, suitable integrations of these processes would        enable to make an economically feasible process which require further        study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137961,,,

This challenge includes the competition for biomass between        food and fuel production. The aim of this paper is to review to what        extent the biomass of plants growing under hostile conditions and on        marginal lands could ease that competition. Biomass from salt-tolerant        algae and halophytes has shown potential for bioenergy production on        salt-affected soils. Halophytes and algae could provide a bio-based        source for lignoceelusic biomass and fatty acids or an alternative for        edible biomass currently produced using fresh water and agricultural        lands. The present paper provides an overview of the opportunities and        challenges in the development of alternative fuels from halophytes and        algae. Halophytes grown on marginal and degraded lands using saline        water offer an additional material for commercial-scale biofuel        production, especially bioethanol. At the same time, suitable strains of        microalgae cultured under saline conditions can be a particularly good        source of biodiesel, although the efficiency of their mass-scale biomass        production is still a concern in relation to environmental protection.

An integrated biorefinery complex        houses a biomass growth and harvesting area and a refining zone for        conversion to product(s) and separation to desired purity levels.

A        biorefinery approach has often been considered and microalgae as a        feedstock has been pampered for its numerous possibilities to produce        biofuels. Depending on the species and cultivation conditions,        microalgae can produce fats, proteins and sugars. These raw materials        can thus be utilized in the production of biofuels, bioenergy and        biochemicals. For this reason, algal biofuels are considered as        sustainable and renewable options for climate related challenges.        However, there are many issues such as supply infrastructure, business        and refinery opportunities, as well as their efficacy, tied to        sustainable production of these energetic materials from algae. Thus,        technical maturity, scalability, energy and material balance demands        coupled with cost, nutrient resources demand, certification and        legislation are needed to demonstrate the biorefinery opportunities of        algal biomass valorisation.

This study reviews the literature        on algae grown on wastewater and includes a preliminary analysis of        algal production based on anaerobic digestion sludge centrate from the        Howard F. Curren Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (HFC AWTP) in        Tampa, Florida and secondary effluent from the City of Lakeland        wastewater treatment facilities in Lakeland, Florida. It was        demonstrated that a mixed culture of wild algae species could        successfully be grown on wastewater nutrients and potentially scaled to        commercial production. Algae have demonstrated the ability to naturally        colonize low-nutrient effluent water in a wetland treatment system        utilized by the City of Lakeland. The results from these experiments        show that the algae grown in high strength wastewater from the HFC AWTP        are light-limited when cultivated indoor since more than 50% of the        outdoor illumination is attenuated in the greenhouse. An analysis was        performed to determine the mass of algae that can be supported by the        wastewater nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorous) available from        the two Florida cities. The study was guided by the growth and        productivity data obtained for algal growth in the photobioreactors in        operation at the University of South Florida. In the analysis, nutrients        and light are assumed to be limited, while CO2is abundantly available.        There is some limitation on land, especially since the HFC AWTP is        located at the Port of Tampa. The temperature range in Tampa is assumed        to be suitable for algal growth year round. Assuming that the numerous        technical challenges to achieving commercial-scale algal production can        be met, the results presented suggest that an excess of 71 metric tons        per hectare per year of algal biomass can be produced. Two energy        production options were considered; liquid biofuels from feedstock with        high lipid content, and biogas generation from anaerobic digestion of        algae biomass. The total potential oil volume was determined to be        approximately 337,500 gallons per year, which may result in the annual        production of 270,000 gallons of biodiesel when 80% conversion        efficiency is assumed. This production level would be able to sustain        approximately 450 cars per year on average. Potential biogas production        was estimated to be above 415,000 kg/yr, the equivalent of powering        close to 500 homes for a year.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",,,,

The        biofuels, produced from food crops are restricted in their capacity to        accomplish biofuel generation targets, mitigation of climate change and        socio-economic development. These issues have exaggerated the curiosity        in flourishing biofuels generated from non-food feedstocks like        agricultural wastes, forest wastes, municipal wastes, and microalgae,        which substantially offer golden opportunities in the longer run. The        anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residues is the potential        alternate of energy production (357.85 bcm biomethane) and has the        capability of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) (979 Mt CO2eq. per        year). This makes it a potential contributor to attain climate        neutrality by 2050. However, the various physical, structural and        compositional factors impeding the hydrolysis of agricultural residues        in AD are to be eliminated. Conjoint application of biological        pretreatment with other pretreatment approaches has proven to be more        efficacious than applying individually.

Biodiesel is        generally produced from renewable sources such as agricultural products        and microalgae in the presence of a suitable catalyst. Recently ionic        liquid (IL) catalyzed synthesis of biodiesel has become a promising        pathway to an eco-friendly production route for biodiesel. This review        focuses on the use of ILs both as solvents as well as catalysts for        sustainable biodiesel production from agricultural feedstocks and        microalgae with high free fatty acid content. Reactions catalyzed by ILs        are known to render high reactivity under the mild condition and high        selectivity of ester product with simple separation steps. The article        first discusses the state of the art of biodiesel production using ILs        along with the physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel.        Then, current IL technologies were elucidated in terms of the categories        such as acidic and basic ILs. The use of more advanced ILs such as        supported ionic liquids and ionic liquid-enzyme catalysts on different        biodiesel feedstocks were also discussed. Furthermore, the role of IL        catalyst in intensified biodiesel production methods such as microwave        and ultrasound technologies were also discussed. Finally, the prospects        and challenges of IL catalyzed biodiesel production are discussed in        this article. The review shows that ILs with bronsted acidity or        basicity not only pose a low risk to the environment but also result in        high biodiesel yields with mild reaction conditions in a short time.        Bronsted acidic ILs can convert free fatty acids as well as        triglycerides to biodiesel without the need for pretreatment, which        facilitates in reducing the production cost of biodiesel. From the        review, it can be concluded that ILs present great potential as        catalysts for biodiesel production.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113647,,,

The        microalgae via open ponds and jatropha cultivation reduce the total        costs and improve negative emissions. The jatropha optimizes the water        use and increases negative emissions. The results indicate that the        integrated management of water must be carefully considered to select        optimal pathway of the environmental friendly biofuel strategies.

As an example of this        significance, based on available data for estimating the potential for        defatted microalgal biomass to displace fishmeal for cultured tilapia,        salmon, shrimp, carp, flounder, yellowtail and cod, by 2020 net primary        production demand from the ocean could be reduced by approximately one        billion tons of carbon.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.057,,,

Microalgae use nutrients, accumulate heavy metals and reduce coliform        bacteria from wastewater, thus contributing to their phytoremediation.        Furthermore, the conversion of algae biomass into biofuels contributes        to reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions        in the atmosphere. Depending on the species and cultivation method,        microalgae have a very fast growth rate (12 days) and their potential to        produce biodiesel is 15 to 300 times higher than that of agricultural        and energy crops conventionally used for biofuels. Lipid content in        microalgae can reach 75-80% by weight of dry biomass. To produce 39        billion liters of biodiesel, 15 million tons of nitrogen and 2 million        tons of phosphorus are required during the growth process of microalgae.        From algae cultivated in 500 billion m3 of industrial wastewater,        approximately 37 million tons of oil can be extracted that can be        transformed into biodiesel. However, there are also challenges in        large-scale utilization of microalgae, due to the high energy input,        technical difficulties encountered in harvesting unicellular microalgae,        and the need for subsequent pretreatment operations to improve lipid        extraction.

Microalgae-based biomass is gaining attention as a potential source of        hydrogen production due to its green energy carrier properties, high        energy content, and carbon-free combustion. This review examines the        hydrogen production process from microalgae, including the microalgae        cultivation technological process for biomass production, and the three        main routes of biomass-to-hydrogen production: thermochemical        conversion, photo biological conversion, and electrochemical conversion.        The current progress of technological options in the three main routes        is presented, with the various strains of microalgae and operating        conditions of the processes. Furthermore, the economic and environmental        perspectives of biomass-to-hydrogen from microalgae are evaluated, and        critical operational parameters are used to assess the feasibility of        scaling up biohydrogen production for commercial industrial-scale        applications. The key finding is the thermochemical conversion process        is the most feasible process for biohydrogen production, compared to the        pyrolysis process. In the photobiological and electrochemical process,        pure hydrogen can be achieved, but further process development is        required to enhance the production yield. In addition, the high        production cost is the main challenge in biohydrogen production.

The results show that the consideration of multiple products in algae systems is directly related to the choice of method(s) used to avoid or solve multifunctionality. The use of a substitution approach leads to the avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions compared to benchmark systems. The net negated emissions from carbon capture and nutrient uptake during algae growth result in reduced impacts on climate change and eutrophication. Finally, the use of waste streams and the consideration of recirculation loops reduce the need for external inputs of water, inorganic fertilisers, and energy. This review provides detailed information on algae system modelling approaches to facilitate the interpretation of LCA results from existing studies and serves as a basis for the development of transparent and reproducible LCI frameworks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.rser.2023.113218,Algae; Biorefinery; Life cycle assessment; System modelling; Multifunctionality; Biogenic carbon;...,,

Algal biomass can be a viable and long-term alternative for biofuel generation and has the capability to replace petroleum or diesel. According to technological economic models, algal biomass can become economically comparable to petroleum due to lowering carbon energy indices. This review entails the process, mechanism, comparative studies, challenges, and various reports involved in algal-based biofuel production. It also discusses the revolutionizing potential or option of algal biofuel, particularly in the transportation sector. Several advantages of algal biofuel over fossil fuels have been discussed, such as renewable, clean, low-cost, and commercial viability. Biofuels can be used as the primary fuel in motors or as a supplement. Sustainable issues regarding renewable biofuel have been addressed, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The preparation of biofuel from three basic components, which are lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, is also discussed. Algae biomass can be used as an energy source for vehicular engines or as an additive to traditional fuels, such as by blending ethanol from sugar biomass with gasoline, offering a sustainable solution for both green product manufacturing and renewable energy requirements. In the aspect of carbon neutrality, algal biomass can be converted intobiofuels, including biomethane, bioethanol, and biohydrogen. The variety of available research and updated mechanisms represent a clear-cut idea for the suitability of industrial-scale biofuel production using selected algal strains. Finally, this review will be helpful to researchers who are working to improve production efficiency, reduce production costs, and realize industrial-scale production.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s43621-024-00472-3,Cyanobacteria; Microalgae; Biofuels; Biodiesel; Bioengineering,,

The concentration of CO2, the most important Green House Gas (GHG), has reached to formidable levels. Although carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods have been largely worked upon, they are cumbersome in terms of economy and their long term environmental safety raises a concern. Alternatively, bio-sequestration of CO2 using microalgal cell factories has emerged as a promising way of recycling CO2 into biomass via photosynthesis which in turn could be used for the production of bioenergy and other value-added products. Despite enormous potential, the production of microalgae for low-value bulk products and bulk products such as biofuels, is heretofore, not feasible. To achieve economic viability and sustainability, major hurdles in both, the upstream and downstream processes have to be overcome. Recent technoeconomic analyses and life-cycle assessments of microalgae-based production systems have suggested that the only possible way for scaling up the production is to completely use the biomass in an integrated biorefinery set-up wherein every valuable component is extracted, processed and valorized. This article provides a brief yet comprehensive review of the present carbon sequestration and utilization technologies, focusing primarily on biological CO2 capture by microalgae in the context of bio-refinery. The paper discusses various products of microalgal biorefinery and aims to assess the opportunities, challenges and current state-of-the-art of microalgae-based CO2 bioconversion, which are essential to the sustainability of this approach in terms of the environment as well as the economy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fmars.2019.00029,microalgae; biorefinery; carbon capture; bio-sequestration; CO2 mitigation; biofuel,,

Microalgae hold great potential as a source of biomass for the production of energy and fungible liquid transportation fuels. However, the technologies required for large-scale cultivation, processing, and conversion of microalgal biomass to energy products are underdeveloped. Microalgae offer several advantages over traditional `first-generation' biofuels crops like corn: these include superior biomass productivity, the ability to grow on poor-quality land unsuitable for agriculture, and the potential for sustainable growth by extracting macro- and micronutrients from wastewater and industrial flue-stack emissions. Integrating microalgal cultivation with municipal wastewater treatment and industrial CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants is a potential strategy to produce large quantities of biomass, and represents an opportunity to develop, test, and optimize the necessary technologies to make microalgal biofuels more cost-effective and efficient. However, many constraints on the eventual deployment of this technology must be taken into consideration and mitigating strategies developed before large scale microalgal cultivation can become a reality. As a strategy for CO2 biomitigation from industrial point source emitters, microalgal cultivation can be limited by the availability of land, light, and other nutrients like N and P. Effective removal of N and P from municipal wastewater is limited by the processing capacity of available microalgal cultivation systems.

Plant and microalgae based feedstocks are prominent and are studied extensively. Plant based feedstocks cultivated as monoculture on wastelands and trees in forests can cater towards partial fulfillment of feedstock requirements for biodiesel industry. Synthesis of biodiesel from microalgal oil has gathered immense interest and has potential to cater to the increasing feedstocks demands of the biodiesel industry. The major advantage offered by microalgal oil, as compared to plant based oils, is its potential for culture on non-arable land. Despite of the advantages of microalgal oil as a feedstock for biodiesel, there are constraints that have to be overcome in order to make it economical and sustainable. Sustainable approaches for both the plant and microalgae as feedstocks have been drawn. Despite there being several plant species, few have been found to be desirable as feedstocks for biodiesel production based on their lipid profiles. Among the microalgae, there are thousands of species and several of these have been cultured for extracting the oil to explore their feasibility in utilization as biodiesel feedstocks. Though, several of the microalgal species have shown potential for high biomass growth and lipid productivity, only a few have been found to provide a high biodiesel yield and conversion. Due to the several steps involved in the extraction of oil which are energy intensive, the cost of biodiesel from microalgal oil is high as compared with that obtained from the plant oils. A sustainable approach for utilizing plant and microalgal oils as feedstocks for biodiesel have been discussed. The emerging cost effective methods in production of biodiesel have been described. The energy return and greenhouse gas emissions from biodiesel have been outlined. Together, the plant oil and microalgal oil can offer potential source of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel.

Based on this review, four main challenges for a sustainability assessment were identified: 1) the use of a clear framework; 2) the adaptation of the methodology to all stages of technological maturity; 3) the use of harmonized assumptions; 4) the integration of the technological process. A generic methodology, based on the integration of a techno-economic assessment methodology and a streamlined life cycle assessment was proposed. This environmental techno-economic assessment can be performed following an iterative approach during each stage of technology development. In this way, crucial technological parameters can be directly identified and evaluated during the maturation of the technology.

The co-pyrolysis of SS with biomass reduced        the overall environmental burden, with sawdust co-pyrolysis        outperforming wheat straw and microalgal co-pyrolysis. All scenarios        achieved a high net positive energy balance (from 2,595 to 6,323        kWh/1,000 kg bio-oil) and reduced global warming potential (GWP) (from        -793 to -1,970 kg CO2eq/1,000 kg bio-oil). Sawdust co-pyrolysis resulted        in the highest GWP reduction (from -1,510 to -1,970 kg CO2eq/1,000 kg        bio-oil) and energy recovery (from 5,551 to 6,323 kWh/1,000 kg bio-oil).        Energy recovery from gaseous fuel through gas turbine operation        generated a process energy demand of 23%-224%. Sawdust co-pyrolysis        exhibited the highest net present worth (NPW) of 6.16 million CAD.        Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the GWP and terrestrial        ecotoxicity potential were affected by the transportation of sawdust and        wheat straw. Overall, the co-pyrolysis of SS with both lignocellulosic        and algal biomass is sustainable and economically feasible for producing        liquid and gaseous fuels and treating hazardous waste originating from        WWTPs, thereby facilitating environmental sustainability and a circular        economy from the sale of pyrolysis products. Broader implication of this        study is using effective catalysts to further strengthen the        sustainability and increase the profitability of the co-pyrolysis        process, which has not been yet investigated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121318,,,

Regarding these cases, the        practical potential associated with the circular economy is evident.        However, this is not an option for microalgal food and supplements due        to strict hygiene requirements for microalgae cultivation used for these        purposes. Currently, the most common cultivation options for microalgae        include phototrophic cascades, photobioreactors, and heterotrophic        fermenters. Generally, the higher requirements for the purity of the        resulting biomass, the higher the consumption of energy and nutrients        needed. These are the main operational parameters that significantly        shape the total environmental and economic performance of microalgae        cultivation processes. The comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of        environmental aspects in the operational phases of three selected        cultivation systems, located in the Czech Republic and used for pure        microalgae biomass production, confirmed that the impacts of these        systems in the assessed categories are fundamentally dependent on the        amount of electricity needed and nutrient consumption, as well as their        sources. For this reason, the heterotrophic fermenter was evaluated as        being the most damaging in the comparison of the three cultivation        systems, while the phototrophic cascade showed a lower total        environmental impact by 15% and the flat photobioreactor was lower        still, by 95%, mainly due to energy production from biomass. The major        impact categories observed were climate change, depletion of fossil        fuels, human toxicity, and freshwater and marine ecotoxicity. The        environmental impacts of microalgae cultivation systems could be further        reduced if cycling practices, such as process water recycling and        reprocessing of generated sewage sludge, were addressed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.3390/su15010769,,,

This review        highlights the sustainable and environmentally friendly approach towards        bioplastic production by utilizing microalgae as a feed source in        several ways. First, the microalgae biomass obtained through the        biorefinery approach can be processed into PHA under certain nutrient        limitations. Additionally, microalgae biomass can act as potential        filler and reinforcement towards the enhancement of bioplastic either        blending with conventional bioplastic or synthetic polymer. The        downstream processing of microalgae via suitable extraction and        pre-treatment of bioactive compounds such as lipids and cellulose are        found to be promising for the production of bioplastics. Moving on, the        intermediate processing of bioplastic via lactic acid synthesized from        microalgae has favoured the microwave-assisted synthesis of polylactic        acid due to cost efficiency, minimum solvent usage, low energy        consumption, and fast rate of reaction. Moreover, the reliability and        effectiveness of microalgae-based bioplastics are further evaluated in        terms of techno-economic analysis and degradation mechanism.

The AP contains >20% of the biomass carbon, and the total        organic carbon in AP is as high as 10-20 g/L. The treatment and        utilization of AP are becoming a bottleneck for the industrialization of        hydrothermal technologies.

This reality of increasing demand in the        face of diminishing fossil supplies is spurring interest in renewable        energy sources. An array of biomass-for-bioenergy resources has been        proposed, with perennial, lignocellulosic feedstocks showing the        greatest potential. Assessment of potential biomass energy resources is        difficult, however, as uncertainties over available land and crop yields        swing reported estimates from 35 to 1135 EJ/year. In the USA, it has        been suggested that more than 1 billion tonnes (910 million Mg) of        biomass could be sustainably harvested, but these estimates are        dependent on continued gains in plant productivity, nutrient use        efficiency and soil and water conservation. Variables of population        growth and increased standards of living will also affect the        availability of land for these energy-producing endeavours. Several        biofuel sources have been identified to include waste streams,        microalgae and woody biomass plantations. With herbaceous-based systems,        much effort is currently being given to corn and other starch or grain        crops that can be readily converted to ethanol. While these crops may        serve to jumpstart the biofuel industry, they have much less potential        to meet demand and much greater potential for negative environmental        impacts. Long-term, high-yielding perennial species will be better        suited to meet the requirements for sustainability, but they are        currently plagued by limitations in pretreatment and processing        technologies. Further upstream of the conversion facility loom the        questions of logistics, e.g. how does one handle and move a bulky,        distributed resource in a cost-effective manner? In addition, there are        important interactions between each component of the supply chain -        agronomy, logistics and processing - that are best not studied in        isolation. Important social issues also stand to influence farmer        decisions regarding market entry which will affect in turn the function        and profitability of a biorefining industry. Once at the facility,        several possible biomass conversion technologies may be employed,        including (but not limited to) pyrolysis to syn-gas and bio-oils or        sugar hydrolysis and fermentation to ethanol. Both have drawbacks, and        the limitation for cellulosic feedstocks remains an economical method of        conversion. It is widely believed that this challenge will be met, but        the question of 'when?' remains. Other, larger questions about the        development of bioenergy resources reside outside the system, with        policy being one of the biggest. For example, bioenergy systems may be        more cost-competitive if policy allows them to benefit from the        potential ecosystem services they provide, e.g. sequestering carbon.        However, such policies may also encourage farmers to convert food crop        land to energy crop land, with concomitant ripple effects throughout the        economy. These and other policy-related risks increase uncertainty; this        uncertainty will limit investments, especially large-scale investments,        in such industries. Bioenergy systems may also face social hurdles from        those who view them as inimical to the interests of local and global        producer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1079/PAVSNNR20072064,,,

In this        case, one possible solution is to convert biomass into green and        sustainable biofuel, which can enhance the bioeconomy and contribute to        sustainable economic development goals. Due to being in large quantities        and containing high organic content, various biomass sources such as        food waste, textile waste, microalgal waste, agricultural waste and        sewage sludge have gained significant attention for biofuel production.        Also, biofuel production technologies, including thermochemical        processing, anaerobic digestion, fermentation and bioelectrochemical        systems, have been extensively reported, which can achieve waste        valorization through producing biofuels and re-utilizing wastes.        Nevertheless, the commercial feasibility of biofuel production is still        being determined, and it is unclear whether biofuel can compete equally        with other existing fuels in the market. The concept of a circular        economy in biofuel production can promote the environmentally friendly        and sustainable valorization of biomass waste. This review        comprehensively discusses the state-of-the-art production of biofuel        from various biomass sources and the bioeconomy perspectives associated        with it. Biofuel production is evaluated within the framework of the        bioeconomy. Further perspectives on possible integration approaches to        maximizing waste utilization for biofuel production are discussed, and        what this could mean for the circular economy. More research related to        pretreatment and machine learning of biofuel production should be        conducted to optimize the biofuel production process, increase the        biofuel yield and make the biofuel prices competitive.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172863,,,

The present study evaluated        the potential of Chlorella sorokiniana to grow at different ratios of        AWD, 30-90%, v/v with conventional growth medium. Results showed that        nutrient removal efficiency after 12 days of cultivation reached up to        85% for total nitrogen, 78% for total phosphorus, 70% for potassium, and        65% for sodium. Thus, all algae-treated AWD samples showed Kelly ratio        (KR) values less than 1, confirming their suitability for direct        application in soil irrigation. In addition, there were insignificant        variations in algal growth and biomass yield across all treatments.        Interestingly, carotenoids yield showed significant increase in all AWD        ratios, with the highest recorded value of 0.750 mg L-1 at day 12 using        90% AWD, compared to 0.523 mg L-1 in the control. Among various        treatments, C. sorokiniana grown in 90% AWD exhibited the highest lipid        content of 201.6 mg g-1 algal dw (comparing to 180.6 mg g-1 dw in the        control). The biodiesel derived from C. sorokiniana at different AWD        ratios demonstrated promising characteristics due to enhancement of        saturated fatty acids proportion, which resulted in lower iodine value,        longer oxidation stability, and higher cetane number than the control.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.biombioe.2024.107448,,,

Our framework        integrates supply chain and techno-economic analysis to assess the        potential of large- and small-scale open pond raceways (OPRs) and bag        photobioreactors (PBRs). We explore the integration of these cultivation        systems with anaerobic digestion, dry algal biomass production, and        biofuel/biogas production units. To guide our assessment, we propose        three economic indicators that we call the ""social milk incentive""        (SMI), ""social animal incentive"" (SAI), and ""social phosphorus        incentive"" (SPI). The SMI is defined as the revenue necessary to achieve        a zero net present value (NPV) for the infrastructure, relative to the        total amount of milk produced in the studied region. The SAI is the        revenue required relative to the number of cows in the region, and the        SPI is the revenue required relative to the total P recovered by the        infrastructure. These indicators facilitate comparisons between        alternative infrastructure layouts, highlight incentives needed, and can        help communicate hidden costs of dairy farming to the public. We use our        framework for analyzing infrastructures that recover P in the Upper        Yahara watershed region in Wisconsin, which currently faces severe        nutrient pollution. Our results show that an infrastructure comprising a        single, centralized OPR coupled with a dry algal production unit        requires the lowest SMI (0.33 USD/gal) and that this incentive        represents 17% of the current price of milk (1.85 USD/gal). Our        framework also reveals that increasing the growth rate of algae by 20%        (e.g., via metabolic engineering) can potentially eliminate the need for        incentives (SMI of 0 USD/gal). Moreover, we found that the best SPI        achievable (22 USD/kg P) is below a recent estimate of the economic        impact of P pollution (74.5 USD/kg P); as such, the proposed        infrastructure provides a viable avenue to mitigate nutrient pollution        and associated environmental costs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03378,,,

Although GM algae biofuel is a well-known        alternative to fossil fuels, the potential environmental and        health-related risks are still of great concern. An evaluation of these        concerns and accordingly devising appropriate mitigation strategies to        deal with them are important to a successful commercialized production        of FGB. While extensive research has been carried out on genetic        modification and other technologies that aim to increase the        productivity of algae strains, only a handful of them deal with the        legislative limitations imposed on exploiting and processing GM algae.        This paper examines this legislation and the mitigation strategies to        meet potential risks associated with the exploitation and processing of        FGB. Open-pond system is an economic solution for large-scale        cultivation of microalgae; however, the concern regarding the health and        environmental risk of cultivating GM algae and the associated stringent        regulations is considered as the main barrier of FGB production.        Disposal of the residue is another important issue that should be        considered in FGB production. The byproducts obtained from energy        extraction step and residual water from the harvesting process may        contain plasmid or chromosomal DNA that may cause the risk of lateral        gene transfer. Hence an appropriate mitigation practices should be used        for replacement of the hazardous water residue and by-products with more        environmentally friendly alternatives. The results obtained from several        field testing projects for open-environment exploitation of GM algae        show that under the various conditions used, there was no apparent proof        to support possible horizontal gene transfer in release of GM algae.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.rser.2019.02.018,,,

However, several challenges must be        addressed before microalgal biomass and bioproducts may be used as fish        feeds, including heavy metal bioaccumulation, poor algal biomass        digestion, and antinutrient effects. Knowledge of biochemical        composition is limited and diverse, and information on nutritional value        is scattered or contradictory. This review article presents alternative        approaches that could be used in aquaculture to make microalgal biomass        a viable alternative to fish meal.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1080/21655979.2022.2061148,,,

The food industry, while holding the potential to address        these challenges through improved techniques and exploring alternative        dietary resources, is itself a significant contributor to these issues.        Industry's operations demand substantial water and energy resources        while generating a substantial volume of wastewater characterized by        organic pollutants and nutrient richness. Microalgae-based wastewater        treatment exhibits the capacity to reduce inorganic nutrient loads,        sequester carbon dioxide, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions while        inhibiting the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, an        integrated approach that combines both microalgae and bacteria emerges        as a comprehensive solution, addressing the challenges of reducing        organic and inorganic waste simultaneously while leveraging their        symbiotic contributions to biogeochemical cycling processes.

Replacing a ton of synthetic plastics with        biobased ones reduces 1.8 tons CO2 emissions. Here, we begin with        highlighting the problem statement-Plastic accumulation and its        associated negative impacts. Microalgae outperforms plants and microbes,        when used to produce bioplastic due to superior growth rate,        non-competitive nature to food, and simultaneous wastewater remediation.        They have minimal nutrient requirements and less dependency on climatic        conditions for cultivation. These are the reasons for current boom in        the algal bioplastic market.

Further, the effects elicited by        microalgae biostimulants with respect to different modes of applications        such as seed treatments, foliar spray and soil/root drenching is        reviewed in detail. In addition, the ability of microalgae metabolites        to impart tolerance against various abiotic and biotic stressors along        with the mechanism of action is discussed in this paper. Although the        use of microalgae based biofertilizers and biostimulants is gaining        popularity, the high nutrient and water requirements and energy        intensive downstream processes makes microalgae based technology        commercially unsustainable. Addressing this challenge, we propose a        circular economy model of microalgae mediated bioremediation coupled        with biorefinery approaches of generating high value metabolites along        with biofertilizer applications. We discuss and review new trends in        enhancing the sustainability of microalgae biomass production by        co-cultivation of algae with hydroponics and utilization of agriculture        effluents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fpls.2023.1073546,,,

Therefore, this        paper reviewed the prospects of biogasoline production as sustainable        alternative to ethanol and a compliment to biodiesel. Apart from        reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, biogasoline promises to be        cheaper and more environmental friendly. Further, inedible feedstocks        such as microalgae and rubber seed oil would ensure higher net energy        gain. Consequently, these will help resolve the food-for-fuel conflicts        and land-use competitions. However, achieving the biofuel central policy        depends on advances in processing the renewable energy sources.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.050,,,

The interest in the mass cultivation of        green microalgae has grown in the last decades, as algal biomass could        be employed to cover a significant portion of global energy demand.        Advantages of microalgal vs. plant biomass production include higher        light-use efficiency, efficient carbon capture and the valorization of        marginal lands and wastewaters. Realization of this potential requires a        decrease of the current production costs, which can be obtained by        increasing the productivity of the most common industrial strains, by        the identification of factors limiting biomass yield, and by removing        bottlenecks, namely through domestication strategies aimed to fill the        gap between the theoretical and real productivity of algal cultures.

Its emissions are the main driver of the        worsening global climate change scenario. Finding feasible options to        sequester this greenhouse gas is a great challenge for scientists,        governments, and industry. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage        (CCUS) are technologies that capture CO2directly or indirectly by        transforming it into other products of interest. In this context,        biological CO2conversion can be performed by photosynthetic        microorganisms, such as microalgae and cyanobacteria, producing a wide        variety of bio-based added-value products, such as third-generation (3G)        bioethanol.

Huge pig sludge amounts produced using actual methods in        large-scale pig breeding farms is a major issue due to the lack of        disposal options and potential water pollution. This issue may be solved        by using pig sludge for algal biofuel production. Therefore, we studied        an economical method of algae production on pig sludge that can be        operated on animal farms in Hungary with modest levels of investment. We        analyzed four algae species,Chlorella vulgaris,Scenedesmus        quadricauda,Scenedesmus dimorphus, andArthrospira platensis, in the        laboratory andC. vulgarisin outdoor conditions. The following parameters        were studied: pot size, illumination, temperature, filtered versus        unfiltered pig manure, water depth, aeration, CO2enrichment, inoculums        solution, fertilization level, and length of rotation period. Produced        alga biomass was measured every 4 days, and the protein- and lipid        content was analyzed using the method of Bradford (1976) and Erickson        (1993). Our results show first that the unfiltered pig manure is not        suitable for algae production due to illumination shortage. By contrast,        using filtered pig manure, we found thatC. vulgarisyield in 70-l indoor        pots was 64% higher than in smaller pots. In a larger outdoor system,        the annual dry yield ofC. vulgarisreached 141-259 t/ha during        12-day-long rotation periods. Here, we demonstrate that only filtered        liquid pig manure can be recommended for algae production.C. vulgarisis        the most suitable alga species for use in large-scale experiments on pig        sludge. Based on our outdoor experiments, the adaptation of a 12- to        14-day rotation period could be considered the most reasonable. An algae        farm can therefore be operated with relative modest amount of capital,        can hence address the issue of sludge management, and provide a        substrate for energy production.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s13593-011-0077-2,,,

Secondary effluents, containing high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus,        need further treatment before being discharged into receiving water        bodies. At the same time, new environmentally friendly energy sources        need to be developed. Integrating microalgal cultivation for the        production of biodiesel feedstock with the treatment of secondary        effluent is one way of addressing both issues. This article provides a        comprehensive review of the latest progress in microalgal cultivation in        secondary effluent to remove pollutants and accumulate lipids.        Researchers have discovered that microalgae remove nitrogen and        phosphorus effectively from secondary effluent, accumulating biomass and        lipids in the process. Immobilization of appropriate microalgae, and        establishing a consortium of microalgae and/or bacteria, were both found        to be feasible ways to enhance pollutant removal and lipid production.        Demonstrations of pilot-scale microalgal cultures in secondary effluent        have also taken place. However there is still much work to be done in        improving pollutants removal, biomass production, and lipid accumulation        in secondary effluent. This includes screening microalgae, constructing        the consortium, making use of flue gas and nitrogen, developing        technologies related to microalgal harvesting, and using lipid-extracted        algal residues (LEA).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",,,,

The utilization        of biofuel can be seen as a short to medium mode for transition into a        green transportation society. Our investigation also showed that        microalgae gave a better ecological footprint which offers the strongest        potential for future Australian biofuel industry and aviation.        Meanwhile, EVs and FCVs also share the portion for long-term        transportation modes scenario.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1051/rees/2017034,,,

The aeration process of activated sludge treatment        requires high energy. So, a sustainable technique for sewage treatment        that could produce less amount of sludge and less energy demanding is        required for various developed and developing countries. This led to        research into using microalgae for wastewater treatment as they reduce        concentrations of nutrients like inorganic nitrates and phosphates from        the sewage water, hence reducing the associated chemical oxygen demand        (COD). The presence of microalgae removes nutrient concentration in        water resulting in reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and toxic        heavy metals like Al, Ni, and Cu. Their growth also offers opportunity        to produce biofuels and bioproducts from algal biomass. To optimize use        of microalgae, technologies like high-rate algal ponds (HRAPs) have been        developed, that typically use 22% of the electricity used in Sequencing        Batch Reactors for activated sludge treatment with added economic and        environmental benefits like reduced comparative operation cost per cubic        meter, mitigate global warming, and eutrophication potentials. The        addition of suitable bacterial species may further enhance the treatment        potential in the wastewater medium as the inorganic nutrients are        assimilated into the algal biomass, while the organic nutrients are        utilized by bacteria. Further, the mutual exchange of CO2 and O2 between        the algae and the bacteria helps in enhancing the photosynthetic        activity of algae and oxidation by bacteria leading to a higher overall        nutrient removal efficiency. Even negative interactions between algae        and bacteria mediated by various secondary metabolites (phycotoxins)        have proven beneficial as it controls the algal bloom in the eutrophic        water bodies.

Algal biomass has emerged as a promising feedstock for the production of carbonaceous adsorbents due to its rapid growth, high photosynthetic efficiency, and ability to thrive in wastewater. This review examines the conversion of algal biomass into biochar and hydrochar through pyrolysis and hydrothermal processes, respectively, and evaluates their potential applications in wastewater treatment, carbon sequestration, and biofuel production. Pyrolyzed algal biochars typically exhibit a moderate to high carbon content and a porous structure but require activation treatments (e.g., KOH or ZnCl2) to enhance their surface area and adsorption capabilities. Hydrothermal carbonization, conducted at lower temperatures (180–260 °C), produces hydrochars rich in oxygenated functional groups with enhanced cation exchange capacities, making them effective for pollutant removal. Algal-derived biochars and hydrochars have been successfully applied for the adsorption of heavy metals, dyes, and pharmaceutical contaminants, with adsorption capacities significantly increasing through post-treatment modifications. Beyond wastewater treatment, algal biochars serve as effective carbon sequestration materials due to their stable structure and high carbon retention. Their application as soil amendments enhances long-term carbon storage and improves soil fertility. Additionally, algal biomass plays a key role in biofuel production, particularly for biodiesel synthesis, where microalgae’s high lipid content facilitates bio-oil generation. Hydrochars, with energy values in the range of 20–26 MJ/kg, are viable solid fuels for combustion and co-firing, supporting renewable energy generation. Furthermore, the integration of these materials into bioenergy systems allows for waste valorization, pollution control, and energy recovery, contributing to a sustainable circular economy. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of algal-derived biochars and hydrochars, emphasizing their physicochemical properties, adsorption performance, and post-treatment modifications. It explores their feasibility for large-scale wastewater remediation, carbon capture, and bioenergy applications, addressing current challenges and future research directions. By advancing the understanding of algal biomass as a multifunctional resource, this study highlights its potential for environmental sustainability and energy innovation. © 2025 by the authors.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.A.

This has led to interest in identifying alternative and renewable energy sources such as biofuel generation from photosynthetic organisms. A wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, known as microalgae, have the potential to be economical and ecologically sustainable in the manufacture of biofuels such as bio-hydrogen, biodiesel, bio-oils, and bio-syngas. By using contemporary bioengineering techniques, the innate potential of algae to produce biomass of superior quality may be enhanced. In algal biotechnology, directed genome modification via RNA-guided endonucleases is a new approach. CRISPR/Cas systems have recently been frequently used to modify the genetic makeup of several aquatic and freshwater microalgae. The majority of research has used the Cas9-driven Type II system, one of two classes and six unique kinds of CRISPR systems, to specifically target desired genes in algae, and knock them out and down, or both. Using CRISPR technology to modify its genetic makeup, microalgae has produced more biomass and increased in lipid content. This review highlights the attempts made so far to target microalgae genome modification, discusses the prospects for developing the CRISPR platform for large-scale genome modification of microalgae, and identifies the opportunities and challenges in the development and distribution of CRISPR/Cas9 components.  © 2025 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: N.

Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that offer exceptional potential due to their rapid growth, high CO₂ fixation capacity, and ability to remove nutrients and pollutants from wastewater, producing both clean water and valuable biomass. Such characteristics have attracted interest in developing circular systems that transform wastes into resources such as biomaterials, biofertilisers, biofuels and bioactive compounds. However, various challenges hinder their industrial application, including technical, economic, environmental, commercial and political barriers. Technical limitations such as inefficient culture systems, low productivity and contamination risks, can be addressed by using genetic engineering tools to develop superior strains, and by developing bioreactors coupled with emerging technologies (AI, Digital Twin). Additionally, it was found that studies using wastewater for microalgae cultivation and a biorefinery approach to recover low and high value bioproducts were found to be energetically, environmentally and economically viable. Several projects and studies demonstrating microalgae-based circular economy models were highlighted.

Microalgae has the potential to play a major role within a sustainable bioeconomy, through zero-waste, carbon-neutral production of multiple biofuels by valorizing the entire biomass. Despite the multitude of advantages in deriving biofuels from microalgae, techno-economic challenges, such as chemical requirements for cultivation, energy requirements of harvesting, and tradeoffs between efficiency-energy-cost of downstream processing methods act as a barrier to scale-up and economically viable operation under the framework of a circular bioeconomy. Thus, this review aims to discuss the potential of microalgae-derived biofuels in achieving a circular bioeconomy through perspectives of possible integration with wastewater bioremediation as well as multiproduct biorefining operations.

However, microalgae systems entail consumption of materials and energy, with potential environmental, economic, and social costs. While environmental and economic impacts have been analyzed in the literature, the social dimension has been barely explored. In this article, social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) is applied to identify the main contributors to social risks. Methodology: In this paper, an approach is proposed and applied to exploit outcomes of a Life Cycle Costing (LCC) study as the input data to model and evaluate the potential social impacts of microalgae biorefinery schemes. Such approach helps ensure the consistency between the economic and social assessments, while facilitating data gathering in a context of data scarcity typical of an emerging technology. Priority levels for stakeholder categories and impact subcategories have been assigned based on the literature. Workers and local communities were identified as the stakeholders with the highest priority, related to impact subcategories such as health and safety issues and fair salary for the former and local employment for the latter. An inventory model was built, using PSILCA database v2.0 Starter and openLCA software, together with cost estimates from an LCC using real data from experiments at lab and pilot scale. Results: According to the results, the main contribution to social risks of the biogas production is expected to be linked to the anaerobic digestion. Some contributors, both from the cultivation and the anaerobic digestion, are basic chemicals production and market public sewage activities, together with civil engineering and construction, and metal products and machinery production. The geographical distribution of risks depends on the stakeholder category and impact subcategory. Since many activities of the value chain are assumed to happen in Spain, a non-negligible part of social risks take place there. However, other countries with minor contributions to total working time are found to have the highest social risk for subcategories and indicators such as fatal accidents. Finally, three scenarios have been compared, considering production in a Chinese, French, or Spanish context, which lead to significant differences. Conclusions: This study aims to highlight the importance of assessing the different dimensions of sustainability in a coherent manner. Furthermore, it provides useful information and hints on main contributors to potential social impacts in the microalgae-based sector based on available information and generic S-LCA databases, and their dependence on geographical locations of the life cycle activities. Despite limitations, conducting such social assessments with available tools is key to better understand the need for widening the scope of sustainability studies. © The Author(s) 2025.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: P.

In recent decades, the co-cultivation of algae-fungi and algae-bacteria consortia has gained more interest due to its enhanced effectiveness in nutrient removal from wastewater and increased biomass production. The present study aims to comprehensively discuss the mechanism, cultivation, harvesting, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing aspects of microalgae and its consortia for wastewater treatment. The enhancement of wastewater treatment and biomass yield through co-cultivation of microalgae-bacterial (MB-C), microalgae-fungi (MF-C), and microalgae-cyanobacteria consortia has been comprehensively analyzed with an updated comparative picture. Further, algae consortia-based biomass potential for biodiesel production has been explored. Factors such as agitation, exogenous carbon supplementation, and harvest frequency play vital roles in algal growth, biomass productivity, and nutrient removal. Reducing algae harvesting costs and finding methods that enable the production of bio-products remain ongoing challenges in algae-based industries.CRISPR-Cas9 stands out as an effective and convenient tool for genome editing. Both MF-C and MB-C hold great promise for wastewater treatment, pollutant removal, and resource recovery. The MF-C strain produces more biomass and lipids than single-culture strains. However, some strains in the MB-C system inhibit lipid development due to a less porous and nitrogen-sensitive system. Furthermore, lipid molecular structures can be engineered, and free fatty acid content can be optimized and personalized through co-cultivation, which is advantageous for biodiesel production.

The high productivity, the significant lipid concentrations of microalgae, and their ability to grow in adverse environments make them very attractive as feedstocks for biofuels. In this review, the authors discuss microalgae potentials as third-generation biofuels, which include the different cultivation systems, culture modes, alimentation modes, and harvesting technologies for microalgal biomass production before biofuel generation. A comprehensive literature review is conducted to identify relevant studies on microalgae by taking several academic databases to ensure a broad coverage of the literature and focusing on the studies of the last decade to ensure that the review includes the most recent advancements and trends in the field. The extracted data were then analysed to identify common trends, innovations, and gaps in the current research. The findings reveal that microalgae attain a lipid content of almost 10–40%, a yield capacity of 58.7–136.9 kl/ha, and a heating value of 32.73–41.0 MJ/kg. The combination of multiple harvesting methods effectively increases the capacity compared to when used individually, as shown by both an increased harvest rate and a reduction in energy consumption. Additionally, pre-treatment methods, including mechanical, thermal, and enzymatic approaches, optimize the conversion of microalgal biomass into various biofuels. Despite these advancements, the transition from laboratory to commercial scale faces challenges, including strain selection, seasonal variations, and cost-effective pre-treatment processes. The commercialization of microalgae-based biofuels will lead to a sustainable and low-carbon future, with potential applications extending to food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.

Recent research has identified microalgae and macroalgae biofuel as one of the major renewable energy sources for environmentally friendly growth, with the potential to replace fossil-based energy sources. The primary disadvantages associated with oil crops and lignocellulose-based biofuels were absent in marine microalgae and macroalgae biofuel. Algae-based renewable energy sources are technically and economically viable, as well as cost competitive; they require no additional land, use little water, and help to reduce atmospheric CO2. Commercial extraction of macroalgae and microalgae biofuel, however, remains impossible due to a small biomass amount and costly downstream procedures. Marine algae-based biofuel production can be made viable by installing sophisticated photobioreactors and developing low-cost biomass collection, drying, and oil recovery technologies. Commercial manufacturing is also achieved through improved genetically modified approaches to stress management, as well as technological metabolic processes to increase lipid production. Furthermore, emerging technologies such as algal-bacterial interactions for improving marine algae growth and lipid production are being investigated.

Widespread greenhouse gas emissions and resulting global warming pose significant risks to the environment, economy, and society. The need for alternative fuels drives the development of third-generation feedstocks: microalgae, seaweed, and cyanobacteria. These microalgae offer traits like rapid growth, high lipid content, non-competition with human food, and growth on non-arable land using brackish or waste water, making them promising for biofuel. These unique phototrophic organisms use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce biofuels, biochemicals, and more. This review delves into the realm of microalgal biofuels, exploring contemporary methodologies employed for lipid extraction, significant value-added products, and the challenges inherent in their commercial-scale production. While the cost of microalgae bioproducts remains high, utilizing wastewater nutrients for cultivation could substantially cut production costs. Furthermore, this review summarizes the significance of biocircular economy approaches, which encompass the utilization of microalgal biomass as a feed supplement and biofertilizer, and biosorption of heavy metals and dyes.

Numerous countries and regions across the globe have conducted extensive research and strategic planning on microalgal bioenergy, investing significant funds and manpower into this field. However, the microalgae biofuel industry has faced a downturn due to the constraints of high costs. In the past decade, with the development of new strains, technologies, and equipment, the feasibility of large-scale production of microalgae biofuel should be re-evaluated. Here, we have gathered research results from the past decade regarding microalgae biofuel production, providing insights into the opportunities and challenges faced by this industry from the perspectives of microalgae selection, modification, and cultivation. In this review, we suggest that highly adaptable microalgae are the preferred choice for large-scale biofuel production, especially strains that can utilize high concentrations of inorganic carbon sources and possess stress resistance. The use of omics technologies and genetic editing has greatly enhanced lipid accumulation in microalgae. However, the associated risks have constrained the feasibility of large-scale outdoor cultivation. Therefore, the relatively controllable cultivation method of photobioreactors (PBRs) has made it the mainstream approach for microalgae biofuel production. Moreover, adjusting the performance and parameters of PBRs can also enhance lipid accumulation in microalgae. In the future, given the relentless escalation in demand for sustainable energy sources, microalgae biofuels should be deemed a pivotal constituent of national energy planning, particularly in the case of China. The advancement of synthetic biology helps reduce the risks associated with genetically modified (GM) microalgae and enhances the economic viability of their biofuel production.

Biofuels such as biodiesel can be produced using third-generation feedstock viz., microalgae. It has gained huge attention as it has the potential to achieve the goals of sustainable development. Biodiesel production using microalgae depends upon the microalgal biomass availability and the amount of neutral lipid accumulated inside them. Biomass productivity and lipid accumulation vary from species to species but in general, are influenced by cultivation conditions (mode and method of cultivation) and growth parameters such as nutrients and environmental factors (light, temperature, pH, aeration, and photoperiod). Lipid extracted from microalgae is transesterified into biodiesel. This review discusses several factors, viz., pre-treatment methods, extraction methods, and transesterification processes that influence the quality and quantity of biodiesel production from microalgae. Explaining the difference between direct and indirect transesterification processes, the review elucidates the roles of catalyst(s) in the transesterification process and FAME production.

However, the combustion of these fossil fuels is the primary cause of emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which contributes to the warming of the planet and enhances greenhouse effect. In order to mitigate the negative effects of fossil fuels, biofuel is promoted as the most effective and environment friendly alternative to fossil fuels. Among the existing feedstocks diatoms and other microalgae have proved to be the most abundant source of existing crude oil from the previous studies and existing literatures. However, an important alternative for fuel from microalgae biomass, is its conversion into bioethanol which is currently the most demanding alternatives to fossil fuels replacing gasolines and aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the scale-up production of bioethanol using microalgae is challenging due to low yields, and high cost. It is crucial to discuss economic aspects, and innovations needed to overcome these shortcomings. Chemical free technologies such as pulsed electric fields (PEF), or induction of biosynthesized nanoparticles as pretreatment methods and economic cultivations like bubble farming and microalgae in microbial fuel cells could enhance the yields, and lower the cost. Wet biomass processing also plays a critical role in cost-effective bioethanol production from microalgae.

Microalgae have been established as a potential feedstock for biofuel production which is renewable as well as environmental friendly. Biofuel production from microalgae biomass is a multistep process and each process is specific to particular microalgae as well. High cost of oil extraction from algal biomass and its conversion into biodiesel poses a major challenge to its commercial viability. Recent studies on algal-based biofuel production have suggested the need of extraction of other co-products like astaxanthin, lutein, β-carotene, omega fatty acids, polysaccharides, and vitamins, from the same algal biomass following the concept of biorefinery analogous to petroleum refinery. Algal chemicals like β-Carotene in its cis form can generate revenue of approximately USD 600 million/kg. The world carotenoid market is estimated to be valued at USD 1.53 billion by the year 2021, Lutein’s market at USD 357.7 million by 2024, Astaxanthin at USD 814.1 million by the year 2022 and Omega fatty acids which includes γ-linolenic acid (GLA), DHA and EPA will be USD 18.95 billion by the year 2020 as reported by two leading market analyst companies. Several studies have reported production of platform chemicals having therapeutics, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics value from the same algal biomass before and after algal oil extraction. To make microalgae-based biofuel production economic and sustainable; other microalgal high-value components extraction is termed as a promising measure. This study presents different strategies including application of genetic and metabolic engineering, chemical genetics, development of efficient unit operations, and identification of alternatives to organic solvents as a solution toward sustainable and economically viable algal-based biofuel production. In addition to this, the article also discusses various aspects of microalgal biofuels and biorefinery including molecules of interest from microalgal biomass, challenges and several innovations to make it lucrative for industrial applications. The use of ionic liquids as an alternative to conventional organic solvents, algal biomass pre-treatment with enzymes, cell disruption techniques like ultrasonication, microwave and pulse electric field are promising strategies.

As a result, microalgae are obliged to only rely on the solid substrate as a means of attachment, without any further nutritional provisions. Slower growth rates, larger resource requirements, and exorbitant operating expenses had prompted the exploration of an alternative strategy, i.e; the innovative use of solid organic waste as nutritional source cum attachment platform.

HTL is a promising route for converting microalgae into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, HTL must be followed by the hydrotreatment of bio-oil to ensure that its composition and properties are compatible with SAF standards. The fact that microalgae offer the possibility of recovering wastewater treatment resources not only makes them more attractive but also serves as an incentive for wastewater treatment, especially in countries where this service has not been universalized. The combination of SAF and wastewater treatment aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, representing an advantageous opportunity for both aviation and sanitation. In this context, the utilization of HTL by-products in the concept of a biorefinery is essential for the sustainability of aviation biofuel production through this route. Another important aspect is the recovery and reuse of catalysts, which are generally heterogeneous, allowing for recycling. Additionally, discussions have focused on biomass pretreatment methods, the use of solvents and catalysts in HTL and hydrotreatment reactions, and the operational parameters of both processes.

One significant by-product of biodiesel production is glycerol, which accounts for about 10% of the total conversion output. While waste glycerol poses challenges due to its impurities and contaminants, it also holds potential as a metabolic resource for essential cellular components in microorganisms. Crude glycerol production is reviewed, highlighting relevance in current biodiesel technologies and its biochemical composition. To efficiently utilize waste glycerol, co-valorization with low-cost substrates through biocircular platforms using various microorganisms or insects for second and third-generation oxy-biofuels has been explored. Among these, the black soldier fly larvae have demonstrated higher competitiveness for lipid contents (35–43%), making them a promising organism for recycling waste glycerol into biodiesel production, alongside microalgae and oleaginous yeast. The microbial biodiesel productivity from oleaginous yeast is notably higher (3546 kg ha−1 y−1) than soybean biodiesel (562 kg ha−1 y−1), while microalgal biodiesel productivity surpasses palm biodiesel by more than 25 times. Remarkably, black soldier fly larvae biodiesel productivity was reported to be ~ 1.7 times higher than microalgae and an impressive ~ 43 times higher than palm biodiesel. Despite their potential for biodiesel production, waste glycerol from biodiesel industry still represents a challenge because of high impurities, high viscosity, and limited direct applications in existing processes. To further enhance energy sustainability and address the challenge of waste glycerol, biocircular platforms are discussed for waste glycerol utilization with domestic wastewater sludge, lignocellulosic biomass, and protein-rich wastes. These platforms offer opportunities to create other sustainable agricultural products while minimizing their environmental footprint. © The Author(s) 2023.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 32; Correspondence Address: M.

The rapid growth in the human population has led to rising energy needs, which are predicted to increase by at least 50% by 2030. Waste management and environmental pollution present the biggest challenge to developing countries. The improvement of energy efficiency while ensuring higher nutritional evacuation wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a significant problem for many wastewater treatment plants. Some treatment techniques require high energy input, which makes them expensive to remediate water use. Pollutants like chemical pesticides, hydrocarbons, colorants (dyes), surfactants, and aromatic compounds are present in wastewater and are contributing to other problems. Israel consumes 10% of the global energy supply, significantly more than other countries. The lagoon and trickling filters are the most widely used technologies in South African WWTPs, where the electricity intensity ranges from 0.079 to 0.41 kWh.m-3 (Wang et al. 2016). Korea and India use almost the same energy (0.24 kWh.m-3). An estimated one-fifth of the energy used in a municipality’s WWTPs is used for overall public utilities, and this percentage is anticipated to rise by 20% over the next 15 years owing to expanding consumption of water and higher standards. In this review paper, we examined the potential for creating energy-self-sufficient WWTPs and discussed how much energy is currently consumed by WWTPs. The desirable qualities of microalgae, their production on a global level, technologies for treating wastewater with biogas and solar power, its developments, and issues for sustainable development are highlighted.

Microgas turbine engines can be promising choice for highway vehicles. This research paper investigates the process of producing fuel from microalgae, as well as its performance and emission characteristics in the micro gas turbine engine operating at sea level conditions for highway vehicle applications. A two-step extraction and transesterification process were employed to convert the biofuel, using a batch stirrer reactor for esterification. The preparation of biofuel blends followed the volume fraction method at the concentration of 10% and 30%. Additionally, nanoparticles were incorporated into the blends at a 50 ppm concentration to enhance overall characteristics of the engine. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles, known for their high surface-to-volume ratio, were used for this purpose. Experimental tests were conducted on a 30 kW micro gas turbine engine to evaluate the fuel's quality in terms of performance and emissions. Various parameters were measured at different engine speed, including 30,000 rpm, 40,000 rpm, 50,000 rpm, 60,000 rpm, and 70,000 rpm. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the optimal blending of biofuel with neat Jet-A fuel improves performance by generating the required thrust while significantly reducing harmful gas emissions. Furthermore, the addition of nanoparticles acted as a catalyst and enhanced the quality of the fuel blends, making them an efficient alternative for aircraft engines as well. Added to above, there is an significant reduction in the emission of the CO has been noted across wide range of speed.

This article summarizes a continuous and comprehensive assessment of different feedstocks needed for third and fourth generations of biodiesel. Various sources of feedstock, steps for biodiesel production, yield of biodiesel obtained through different methods, properties of biodiesel like fatty acid profile, density, viscosity, cetane number, flash point, cloud point, economic feasibility and considerations are also discussed. Third generation biodiesel like microalgae can be widely used in CI engines. It is observed that their performance and combustion analysis in a CI engine is determined by the physico chemical properties of obtained biodiesel and nature of feedstock. Species selection and cultivation methods of microalgae, future perspectives of cultivating techniques and lipid production are summarized in detail. Fourth generation biodiesel like solar fuels and synthetic biomass production are covered, though their application in various energy fields is still not revealed. The type of transesterification that best suits the free fatty acid profile of fuel is selected and other reaction parameters like reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst quantity and oil methanol molar ratio are explained individually for third generation feedstocks. Proper adoption of suitable methods would help in yielding the maximum biodiesel. Future energy demand can be dealt with by the combination of various third and fourth generation oil feedstocks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: V.

The mitigation of the adverse effects of CO2 can be accomplished through its conversion into useful products or renewable fuels. In this regard, microalgae is a promising candidate due to its high photosynthesis efficiency, sustainability, and eco-friendly nature. Microalgae utilizes CO2 in the process of photosynthesis and generates biomass that can be utilized to produce various valuable products such as supplements, chemicals, cosmetics, biofuels, and other value-added products. However, at present microalgae cultivation is still restricted to producing value-added products due to high cultivation costs and lower CO2 sequestration efficiency of algal strains. Therefore, it is very crucial to develop novel techniques that can be cost-effective and enhance microalgal carbon sequestration efficiency. The main aim of the present manuscript is to explain how to optimize microalgal CO2 sequestration, integrate valuable product generation, and explore novel techniques like genetic manipulations, phytohormones, quantum dots, and AI tools to enhance the efficiency of CO2 sequestration. Additionally, this review provides an overview of the mass flow of different microalgae and their biorefinery, life cycle assessment (LCA) for achieving net-zero CO2 emissions, and the advantages, challenges, and future perspectives of current technologies.

Microalgae thanks to their metabolic versatility represent a promising solution for a ‘green’ economy, exploiting non-arable land, non-potable water, capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) and solar energy. The interest in microalgae is justified by their high content of bioactive molecules, such as amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, polyunsaturated fatty acids (as ω-3 fatty acids), pigments (as β-carotene, astaxanthin, fucoxanthin, phycocyanin, zeaxanthin and lutein), or mineral elements. Such molecules are of interest for human and animal nutrition, cosmetic and biofuel production, for which microalgae are potential renewable sources. Microalgae, also, represent effective biological systems for treating a variety of wastewaters and can be used as a CO2 mitigation approach, helping to combat greenhouse gases and global warming emergencies. Recently a growing interest has focused on extremophilic microalgae species, which are easier to cultivate axenically and represent good candidates for open pond cultivation.

The need of the hour is to minimize fossil fuel usage and capture the atmospheric CO2. Broadly, the CO2 mitigation strategies employ carbon capture and storage (CCS) and biological carbon capture and utilization (bio-CCU) technologies. A critical comparative summary of the prevalent CCS and bio-CCU methods has been presented in this study. Among all the CO2 capture technologies, the microalgal bio-CCU in a biorefinery model is more environment and economy-friendly. Microalgal biorefinery can potentially serve as a platform not only for bio-CCU but also for producing third-generation biofuels and commercially important value-added products as means of wealth generation from waste CO2. Alongside reducing the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, this approach also directly or indirectly addresses most of the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs). To enhance the microalgal CO2 capture efficiency and consequent biomass productivity, smart bioprocess design and reactor engineering performed by researchers are summarized to understand the progress in this direction. Recent advances, innovations, and existing challenges in the design and development of microalgal cultivation processes and systems, including CO2 delivery mechanisms, have been critically discussed and assessed in terms of carbon capture efficiency.

Not only the storage capacity is limited, but also the use of the ecological environment causes great damage, a serious threat to human life safety. Microalgae biodiesel receives extensive attention due to its biodegradable and carbon-neutral green energy characteristics, which is used to reduce or replace the use of these fossil fuels. Because of the slow growth of microalgae, low lipid content and low biodiesel production, people begin to study ways to improve the growth and lipid production of microalgae and catalytic conversion of biodiesel. In this paper, the research progress of the whole process from microalgae culture to microalgae oil production to microalgae catalytic conversion of biodiesel in recent years is reviewed. The efficient growth and oil production of microalgae, the catalytic conversion methods of microalgae biodiesel and the application prospects of microalgae biodiesel are discussed and summarized. Specifically, this review critically discusses: (i) The current development status of microalgae culture and microalgae biodiesel; (ii) Cultivation methods for efficient growth and oil production of microalgae under different stress conditions; (iii) The effects of different types of catalysts and catalytic methods on the yield of biodiesel; (iv) Environmental problems and economic value of the whole process of microalgae biodiesel production; (v) Current limitations and future research directions in the field of microalgae biodiesel. Studies show that regulating light, temperature, pH, nutrients, etc. can improve the growth and oil production of microalgae, in which the addition of anions and cations can change the physiological, biochemical and metabolic mechanisms of microalgae. At present, a large number of genetic modification and metabolic regulation engineering technologies are applied to microalgae oil production. They have precise control of the targeting mechanism in cells to induce increased lipid accumulation. The two-stage culture model can simultaneously increase biomass and lipid content. The addition of homogeneous, heterogeneous, biological enzymes and nano-catalysts accelerates the conversion efficiency and improves the yield of biodiesel. The catalytic yield of several magnetic nano-catalysts studied is as high as > 98 %. The supercritical method and ionic liquid method are favored by everyone because they do not use catalysts to reduce environmental pollution. In situ transesterification replaces the traditional two-step transesterification method to reduce energy consumption and cumbersome steps. Hydrothermal liquefaction method can directly convert wet algae biomass into biofuels without drying at high temperatures and pressure and in the presence of water. However, the current high-cost economic problems in the production of microalgae biodiesel and the environmental problems caused by the addition of catalysts need to further study the efficient and low-cost microalgae culture methods and new environmentally friendly catalysts and catalytic methods to improve the yield of microalgae biodiesel, to realize the commercial production of microalgae biodiesel as soon as possible. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 35; Correspondence Address: Y.-T.

M-WWD was achieved by replacing ultraviolet disinfection with a microalgal open raceway pond in an existing sewage treatment plant (STP) in India. Regarding impacts on human health, both M-WWD and STP yielded comparable life cycle impacts, around 0.01 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per person per year. However, QMRA impacts for M-WWD (0.053 DALYs per person per year) were slightly lower than that for STP while considering exposure to E. coli O157:H7 and adenovirus. Additionally, a comparative LCA resolved the dilemma about the appropriate utilization of microalgal biomass.

Moreover, these nations strive to achieve complete elimination of greenhouse gases, considering the context of the ongoing and escalating global energy crisis. As a result, researchers are investigating bio-based feedstocks as viable and environmentally friendly alternatives for bioenergy production. Microalgae are a type of photosynthetic microorganism that could be used as a renewable energy resource. They are capable of growing in harsh environmental circumstances and on terrain that is not suitable for agriculture. Additionally, they tend to flourish in both seawater and wastewater. Microalgae exhibit superior photosynthetic efficiency and biomass productivity in comparison to their terrestrial plant counterparts. Microalgae biomass, as well as the metabolites derived from it, can be transformed into a range of biofuels, including bioethanol, biodiesel, crude oil, pyrolytic bio-oil, biomethane, biohydrogen, and jet biofuel.

To enhance the sustainability of the environment and economic feasibility of microalgal bioethanol, it is crucial to choose suitable microalgal bio jets, create methods for concentrating biomass, and utilize wet microalgal biomass for bioethanol production. All these methods and steps need to be carried out meticulously. Additionally, adopting a coordinated biorefinery approach to produce value-added products would further contribute to the identified goals. This article aims to provide an overview of the present state of research on microalgal bioethanol and its prospects. © Association of Microbiologists of India 2024.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: R.C.

It underscores the need to explore alternative energy sources. Biodiesel, derived from renewable feedstock, is considered a promising solution to meet future energy needs while addressing concerns about dwindling fossil fuel reserves and environmental issues. Microalgal oils are identified as third-generation feedstock for biofuels production due to their advantages over conventional edible crops and non-edible oils, which face limitations in availability and yield. Microalgal oils are particularly significant because edible oils serve as food sources, and non-edible oil resources have slow growth rate as well as less oil yields. For biodiesel derived from any feedstock, meeting specific physical and chemical properties to comply with biodiesel standards. Therefore, thoroughly examining the conversion process from microalgal oil to biodiesel is necessary. This study explores various aspects of microalgal oils as biodiesel feedstock, including different microalgal species and their oil content, technologies used for biodiesel production from microalgal oils and biomass, and biodiesel standards and characterization across other countries. Techno-economics and Life Cycle Assessment are applied in this study to evaluate the economic viability and environmental impact of microalgae-based processes, addressing challenges such as data availability, uncertainty, and stakeholder engagement.

Unlike energy crops (like oil palm and sugar cane), microalgae benefit from faster growth rate, higher lipid content, smaller land area required, ability to flourish using waste or brackish water, and posing zero competition with food crops. Microalgae-derived biofuels (like biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, and biohydrogen) are sustainable energy sources that can be produced using well-developed techniques (e.g., transesterification, fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and Fisher–Tropsch process). To prevent dire climate conditions resulting from the global temperature rise of 1.5°C and resolve worldwide energy security issue, our generation will need to establish and implement renewables on a global scale. To improve the industrial production of microalgal biofuel, the efficiencies of biomass and metabolite production to post-cultivation biofuel synthesis processes must be enhanced. For the cultivation step, there exist three key techniques that can directly change the traits, structure, and behavior of microalgal cells, and induce them to accumulate targeted metabolites rapidly and in large amounts. These techniques are genetic engineering, chemical modulation, and nanomaterial approach. Genetic engineering commonly alters the chloroplast DNA of microalgae to overexpress or down-regulate key genes in various metabolic pathways so that the cells accumulate more lipids. Chemicals can also be used to modulate microalgal growth and lipid accumulation by inducing oxidative stress or prevent conversion of lipid molecules. Nanomaterials and nanoparticles can also enhance microalgal lipid production by microenvironmental stress induction, vitamin supplementation, and light backscattering. Therefore, in this review, the recent progress as well as the pros and cons of genetic engineering, chemical modulation, and nanomaterial approach in achieving greater biofuel production from microalgae are comprehensively examined. © 2024 The Authors.

The paper serves the innovative scientific knowledge for CO2 transformation via a biochemical pathway to microalgal biomass with its subsequent treatment to biofuels and bioproducts assuming milder climatic conditions (Central or Eastern Europe, Visegrad countries or climatically related world regions). The recent trends were critically reviewed for microalgal biorefinery to reach the sustainability of microalgal-based chemicals with added value, digestion, hydrothermal liquefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification of microalgal residues. Knowledge-based chemical process engineering analysis, systematic data synthesis, and critical technical evaluation of available life cycle assessment studies evaluated the sustainability of microalgal biorefinery pathways.

In the Philippines, future biodiesel consumption is projected to rise due to the anticipated increase in biodiesel blending mandated by the Philippine Biofuels Law. Massive research efforts were conducted in search for alternative feedstocks in the Philippines. This led to several studies using third-generation feedstock (such as microalgae) for biodiesel production. Previous studies have shown that microalgae can be cultivated in engineered systems and can produce biodiesel with superior quality fuel characteristics, which makes them a promising source of biomass feedstock for biodiesel production. Microalgae is also a sustainable option for feedstock because they occupy less land area compared to other feedstocks and they are not being consumed as food.

However, the global share for these biofuels has been inadequate recently, especially due to the ongoing global pandemic. Therefore, this paper offers a review of the state-of-the-art study of the production field of third-generation biofuel from microalgae. The current review aims to focus on the different aspects of algal biofuel production that requires further attention to produce it at a large scale. It was found that several strategies during the life cycle of algal biofuel production can significantly increase its quality and yield while reducing cost, energy, and other related attributes. This paper also focuses on the challenges for large-scale production of third-generation biofuels pre and post COVID-19 to better understand the barriers. The high cost of this fuel’s production and sale tends to be the major reason behind the lack of large-scale production, hence, inadequacy to meet the global need.

The application of biofuel as an alternative energy source will not only help in maintaining a clean environment and improving air quality but also decrease harmful organic matter content from aquatic bodies. Cyanobacteria are valuable sources of many novel bioactive compounds, such as lipids and natural dyes, with potential commercial implications. One of the advantages of cyanobacteria is that their biochemical constituents can be modified by altering the source of nutrients and growth conditions. Careful changes in growth media and environmental conditions altering the quality and quantity of the biochemicals and yield capacity have been discussed and analyzed. In the present review, the challenges and successes achieved to date in the commercial production of biofuel and its application in the transportation industry are discussed. The authors also focus on different types of feedstocks obtained from biomass, especially from cyanobacterial species.

The existing wastewater treatment system is incompetent at eliminating ECs since the effluent water contains significant concentrations of ECs, viz., antibiotics (0.03–13.0 μg L-1), paracetamol (50 μg L-1), and many others in varying concentrations. Microalgae are considered as a prospective and sustainable candidate for mitigating of ECs owing to some peculiar features. In addition, the microalgal-based processes also offer cost and energy-efficient solutions for the bioremediation of ECs than conventional treatment systems. It is pertinent that, microalgal-based processes also provides waste valorization benefits as microalgal biomass obtained after ECs treatment can be potentially applied to generate biofuels. Moreover, microalgae can effectively utilize alternative metabolic (cometabolism) routes for enhanced degradation of ECs. Additionally, the ECs removal via the microalgal biodegradation route is highly promising as it can transform the ECs into less toxic compounds. The present review comprehensively discusses different mechanisms involved in removing ECs and various factors that affect their removal. Also, the technoeconomic feasibility of microalgae than other conventional wastewater treatment methods is summarised. The review also highlighted the different molecular and genetic tools that can augment the activity and robustness of microalgae for better removal of organic contaminants.

Thus, wastewater treatment plants with capacities ranging from 8000 to 200,000 tons/day have been implemented to treat wastewater and discharge effluent with improved quality parameters. Nonetheless, the generation of 160,000–210,000 tons/year of sludge and the requirement for advanced treatment to achieve non-detectable residues are significant concerns for highly effective wastewater treatment. In this context, microalgae with the potential of effective nutrient removal from wastewater streams have been exploited in wastewater treatment at primary, secondary and tertiary treatment stages. Microalgae-based bioremediation generates valuable biomass with metabolites, namely lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, which could be utilized in the value-added production of biofuels, biofertilizers, etc. Moreover, microalgae integrated wastewater treatment systems would substantially remove residual pollutants, nutrients, and pathogens with high removal efficiencies. Hence, the integration of microalgae into the conventional wastewater treatment process enhances the process sustainability while contributing to the concept of a circular bioeconomy.

Aviation gasoline and kerosene are currently used to power most jet engines. While battery-powered planes and planes that could utilise a cleaner fuel, such as hydrogen, are possible, the time scale required to improve and implement these technologies is distant, with air fleet turnover taking some 30 years. Existing jet engines could be modified to run on biodiesel, and considering the close similarity in fuel density to kerosene, could be a less disruptive approach to the industry. The sheer volume of biodiesel required remains a challenge, and certainly, using plant-derived oils grown on arable land is not acceptable, as it competes with food production. However, high-lipid-yielding microalgae (where productivity is an order of magnitude greater than oilseeds), grown on marginal land, such as desert or semi-desert areas of the world, could be possible. Indeed, to replace 30% of fossil fuel with algal-derived biodiesel would require 11,345 km2 of land.

However, there is experimental evidence that the latter one, including but not limited to variation in mass/size, internal composition and cell cycle phase, can play a crucial role in both cultivation and downstream processes. Population balance equations (PBEs) represent a powerful approach to develop mathematical models describing the effect of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. In this work, the potential of PBEs for the analysis and design of microalgae processes are discussed. A detailed review of PBE applications to microalgae cultivation, harvesting and disruption is reported. The review is largely focused on the application of the univariate size/mass structured PBE, where the size/mass is the only internal variable used to identify the cell state. Nonetheless, the need, addressed by few studies, for additional or alternative internal variables to identify the cell cycle phase and/or provide information about the internal composition is discussed. Through the review, the limitations of previous studies are described, and areas are identified where the development of more reliable PBE models, driven by the increasing availability of single-cell experimental data, could support the understanding and purposeful exploitation of the mechanisms determining cell-to-cell heterogeneity. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: A.

However, their production on a large scale would require a large amount of water and nutrients. Considering the importance of food security and the high economic value of microalgal biomass, food and feed applications should be prioritized if microalgae are grown using conventional water resources. Nevertheless, microalgae can also be grown in nutrient-rich wastewater streams while producing valuable biomass and treating harmful effluents. Because of health issues, food and feed applications of microalgal biomass grown using waste resources are not allowed; hence, it can be used as a feedstock for biofuel production. In line with that, this review first briefly discusses the applications of microalgae in food, feed, and wastewater treatment and then summarizes the efforts put into utilizing microalgal biomass to produce biofuels through different pathways. These technologies, including thermochemical (200–1300 °C), biochemical (25–55 °C), and chemical (25–200 °C) conversion methods, are critically discussed. The pros and cons of using different microalgal conversion technologies are outlined to identify possible future directions for the field. Different microalgal biomass harvesting methods are also reviewed, and the process conditions are summarized. Parameters affecting technology selection, such as energy costs, reaction time, and technological sophistication, are also explored and presented. In general, microalgal biofuels still face many challenges in replacing traditional fossil fuels.

In order to widely commercialize this technology, its limitations and weaknesses must be eliminated. Many technical and economic issues also need to be clarified and unknowns answered. Microalgae-based technologies have been shown to be versatile, efficient and suitable for practical and commercial use. However, the current technological readiness level (TRL) of most microalgae-based bioenergy production systems precludes their quick and widespread implementation. Their development is limited by a combination of factors that must be precisely identified, after which their negative impact on scale-up prospects can be eliminated or minimized. The present study identifies the main barriers to the development of industrial microalgae-production and microalgae-to-biofuel systems. In addition, it proposes measures and efforts necessary to achieve a higher TRL, which will provide investors with sought-after performance and cost-efficiency data for the given project. The main barriers to the development of microalgae cultivation and processing systems have been identified to include: the complex nature of the cultivation process with multiple variables involved; lack of sufficient data from pilot-scale and near-full-scale plants, which often precludes reliable life cycle assessment (LCA); and insufficient legal assistance, advisory assistance, subsidies and funding for innovative projects. Potential ways of improving performance and competitiveness of microalgae-based systems include: process optimization techniques, genetic engineering, yield improvement through advanced process control and monitoring, use of waste as feedstock and dedicated support programs.

First- and second-generation biofuels are not able to meet the demand. Third-generation biofuels use microalgae as the fuel feedstock and can, at least in principle, meet global demand. Microalgae can also become a carbon sink to minimize or even reverse fossil-carbon emissions. Despite their benefits, microalgae-to-fuel technologies have been stalled due to three barriers: the relatively low solar-energy-conversion efficiency of photosynthesis, substantial energy inputs for process operation, and the costs of harvesting and down-stream processing of microalgae biomass. Here, we describe the unique advantages that microalgae present based on their superior biochemical composition as fuel precursors, compared to first- and second-generation feedstocks. We review recent advancements in microalgal cultivation, harvesting, biofuel quality, and metabolic engineering. We also review non-fuel products that are promising for improving the economics of microalga cultivation via a biorefinery strategy. Taken together, these advancements lead to updated economic and environmental considerations that improve prospects for microalgal commercialization. In any case, moving microalgal-based biofuels and by-products to a large scale will require continued research and development to lower the cost of the produced feedstock and to ensure that algal biomass is acceptable for human consumption. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1039/d2se01599d,Biofuels;Carbon;Energy conversion efficiency;Feedstocks;Fossil fuels;Metabolic engineering;Microorganisms;Solar energy;Sustainable development;A-carbon;Carbon emissions;Carbon sink;Fossil carbon;Global demand;Micro-algae;Renewable energies;Second generation;Sustainable production;Third generation;biochemical composition;biofuel;biomass;carbon sink;cultivation;harvesting;microalga;research and development;Microalgae,,

However, the current microalgal growth using traditional liquid-based culture is not economically viable as the price of microalgal biofuel is still higher compared to its fossil fuel counterpart. In fact, microalgal dewatering requires substantial energy and represents a major bottleneck limiting the industrial microalgal mass production. Compared to conventional planktonic microalgae growth systems, the attached growth or biofilm-based growth represents several advantages such as higher biomass content compared to liquid culture and lower capital costs, which has a great potential to help microalgal fuels reach economic viability. However, despite the many advantages of biofilm-based growth, limited work has been reported on their use to mass produce microalgal biofuels or bioproducts. This review discusses the factors affecting microalgal biofilms growth as well as the challenges that hinder their large-scale production. Several parameters such as the microalgal strain, the microalgal adhesion to the substrate, operation conditions, and physico-chemical properties of the substrate are outlined in depth. This review highlights the current challenges in microalgal biofilm development and identifies strategies to improve biofilms growth, to optimize the economics of microalgal biomass production and downstream processing, and to promote the commercial industrialization of algal biofilm. A preliminary economic assessment of Chlorella sp., Spirulina sp. and Scenedesmus sp. biofilms compared to liquid cultivation is evaluated, showing that the biomass production costs for biofilm-based cultivation system are 8–10 times lower than that of suspension-based cultivation system. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 44; Correspondence Address: H.

Consequently, the past few decades saw the emergence of researches focussing on the derivation of renewable substitutes for non-renewable energy resources. Microalgae show promise as a feedstock that could efficiently replace or reduce the need of fossil fuels owing to their resilience to adapt in diverse environment and high lipid content. Present comprehensive review offers an in-depth analysis on the various parameters involving the usage of microalgae for wastewater treatment and production of biodiesel along with other value-added products. The critical analysis showed differential responses of microalgae species towards biotic factors which can influence the accumulation of biomolecules. This necessitates a systematic study on the algal biodiversity to determine the optimal growth conditions which determine their economic feasibility in biorefinery, bioremediation, and circular economy. Biomolecules, especially lipid accumulated in microalgae can be extracted, transesterified to produce fatty acid methyl esters, and eventually transformed into biodiesel. In wastewater treatment, algal biomass can reduce Biological and Chemical Oxygen Demand up to the extent of 90%. Succinctly, microalgae also have the ability to sequester major water pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus, absorb heavy metals, xenobiotic compounds, and emerging contaminants to ameliorate water quality. Consequently, propagating microalgae in wastewater could couple green approaches like biosorption for wastewater treatment and biodiesel production. This review also showed that the prospects of biorefinery and multiple value-added products from microalgae enhance the economic viability of microalgae to help achieve environmental sustainability, sustainable development goals (SDGs), and energy resilience. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: P.K.

The innate potential of microalgae over traditional terrestrial feedstocks to provide a high-quality and sustainable fuel portfolio has been recognized. Microalgae are known to mitigate atmospheric CO2 and convert it to valuable metabolites and bioactive compounds. The high growth rate of microalgal biomass with no additional requirements of feed and arable land makes microalgae as realistic alternative to existing biofuels sources. Micro-algae can store more primary metabolites under abiotic stress, which can be used as a possible source of energy. These metabolite storing abilities of microalgae have become a point of interest for the scientific community as the accumulated lipids serve as potential feedstock for biodiesel production by transesterification, whereas the carbohydrates can be used as the feedstock for bioethanol production by fermentation. Although microalgae-based biofuels are viable sources of energy, their commercialization and deployment in the fuel market remain a challenge. As a result, efforts are being undertaken to make it more cost-effective.

The present global energy strategy is built on cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives; and production of microalgae has the ability to meet these requirements. Microalgae have been found as a promising and sustainable alternative for treating wastewater (WW) concurrently with biofuel production. One potential strategy, which uses microalgae for lowering the level of contamination in WW is called bioremediation. There are substantial gains to be made for both the economy and the environment through the integration of microalgae-based biofuel production with wastewater treatment (WWT). The use of microalgae that have a short life span, a high growth rate, and a high CO2 usage efficiency is one of the promising approaches for producing biomass from WW nutrients that involves the utilization of renewable resources. Microalgae are one of the most promising biomass resources for use in thermochemical conversion processes for the production of liquid and gaseous biofuels due to their advantages over other biomass feedstocks, such as sustainability, renewability, and productivity. Currently, technology and cost are the primary obstacles limiting industrial applicability, which necessitates an optimum downstream process to minimize production costs. Consequently, the concurrent utilization of microalgae for WWT and biofuel production has made these challenges practical and economically viable. This review provides an overview of microalgae and their bioremediation and bioenergy production applications. It also provides insight for future research to investigate additional possible applications of microalgal biomass.

However, the usage of fossil fuels has been strongly correlated with impactful problems, which lead to global warming. Moreover, the excessive use of fossil fuels has led to their rapid depletion. Hence, exploring other renewable and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels is imperative. One of the most sustainable fossil fuel alternatives is biofuel. Microalgae-based biofuels are receiving the attention of researchers due to their numerous advantages compared with those obtained from other types of feedstocks. Hence, it is essential to explore the recent technologies for biofuel produced from microalgae species and define the possible challenges that might be faced during this process. Therefore, this work presents the recent advancements in biofuel production from microalgae, focusing on emerging technologies such as those using nanomaterials and genetic engineering. This review focuses on the impact of nanoparticles on the harvesting efficiency of various microalgae species and the influence of nanoparticles on biofuel production. The genetic screening performed by genome-scale mutant libraries and their high-throughput screening may assist in developing effective strategies for enhancing microalgal strains and oil production through the modification of enzymes. Furthermore, the barriers that limit the production of biofuels from microalgae are introduced. Even though microalgae-based biofuels are perceived to engage with low negative impacts on the environment, this review paper touches on several environmental issues associated with the cultivation and harvesting of microalgae species. Moreover, the economic and technical feasibility limits the production of microalgae-based biofuels. © 2022 by the authors.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: ; A.H.

However, palm oil mill effluent can be used as a nutrient for the growth of microalgae with utility in pollutant removal and algae biorefinery production of biofuel and functional foods. The aim of the present study was to analyze the sustainability of microalgae biomass production by calculating a sustainability index. METHODS: Questionnaires were used to evaluate the scientific judgment of expert researchers in the field of microalgae research. Data were processed and analyzed using multidimensional scaling comprising social, economic, ecological, and technological dimensions with a total of 47 attributes in Rapfish software. FINDINGS: The sustainability index of microalgae biomass production was calculated as 73.53%, which indicates the process has the potential for sustainable development with consideration of the leverage factors identified in each dimension. Analysis of the four dimensions demonstrated that the environment dimension had the lowest leverage at 67.30%, while the economy, technology, and social dimensions had leverage values of 70.99%, 73.67%, and 82.17%, respectively. These findings indicate that management experience and skills (environment and technological dimensions), involvement of family members (social dimension), and productivity level (economic dimension) warrant further attention in order to improve the sustainability of microalgae biomass production. CONCLUSION: The prospective analysis in the present study identified production, productivity, land conversion, consumption per capita, and population as key or dominant factors influencing the microalgae supply system. Further research is required to fully utilize microalgae biomass as a value-added product in optimal, technically, economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable systems.

Microalgae have been proposed as a suitable biological platform to reduce carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, while also creating commercial sources of high-value compounds such as medicines, cosmetics, food, feed, and biofuel. Industrialization of microalgae culture and valorization is still limited by significant challenges in scaling up the production processes due to economic constraints and productivity capacities. Therefore, a boost in resource usage efficiency is required. This enhancement not only lowers manufacturing costs but also enhancing the long-term viability of microalgae-based products. Using wastewater as a nutrient source is a great way to reduce manufacturing costs. Furthermore, water scarcity is one of the most important global challenges. In recent decades, industrialization, globalization, and population growth have all impacted freshwater resources. Moreover, high amounts of organic and inorganic toxins in the water due to the disposal of waste into rivers can have severe impacts on human and animal health.

Nonetheless, the commercialization of BD has not yet been realized because of expensive and energy-intensive cultivation, pretreatment, and BD conversion processes in reference to 1st generation BD production. To resolve the issues, this study comprehensively reviewed the current technical developments of microalgal BD production process and suggested promising future studies. Current microalgal BD production processes highly rely on the processes developed from 1st generation BD process, namely base-catalyzed transesterifications. However, the base-catalyzed suffers from saponification reaction and low production yield due to high water and free fatty acid contents in microalgae. Vigorous pretreatments such as dewatering, drying, esterification of free fatty acid, and purification are required for high yield of microalgal BD production, making this process economically not attractive. As efforts to construct new transesterification platform, novel approaches tolerant to impurities such as thermally induced non-catalytic transesterifications were suggested. The thermally induced reactions allowed in situ conversion of microalgal lipid into BD (≥ 95 wt.% yield) within 1 min of reaction at ≥ 350 ˚C.

Microalgal biofuel has been recognized as one of the most prominent and versatile alternative renewable energy sources because it can be converted into a wide array of biofuels, such as biodiesel, bioethanol, bioelectricity and biogases such as syngas, methane, hydrogen, and hythane etc., with a lower carbon emission profile. To attain the economic viability of algal fuels, a collective biorefinery approach addressing both the operational and technical limitations is quintessential. The current review critically analyzes and categorizes energy aspects of microalgae through various direct and indirect approaches with the perspective of a circular economy. These approaches include complicated thermochemical and biochemical processes integrating the recovery of a wide range of value-added products apart from biofuels, thus defining a cascading approach for a multi-product-based biorefinery model.

In this study, the value of externalities associated with different types of biofuel feedstock is estimated using discrete choice experiments with a sample of Australian fuel consumers. The results indicate that newer biofuel feedstock, like microalgae, can generate high consumer values relative to its agricultural-based predecessors. Consumers were found to be willing to pay more than double for biofuels that avoid a 10 % increase to food prices, an issue that has plagued the long-term viability of agricultural-based biofuels. Consumer values for biofuels with low lifecycle emissions were also substantial. Further modelling also revealed that existing biofuel policies and higher incomes had contradictory associations with consumer values. The results should inform policy on biofuels. In particular, the high non-market values for externalities suggest that policies should encourage the development of a more diversified range of feedstock use and related technologies—rather than prioritising market transition away from fossil fuels—to increase the production of more sustainable fuel alternatives.

However, many historical TEA studies have focused on the conversion of biomass with elevated levels of carbohydrates and lipids and lower levels of protein, incurring substantial burdens on the ability to achieve high cultivation productivity rates relative to nutrient-replete, high-protein biomass. Given a strong dependence of algal biomass production costs on cultivation productivity, further TEA assessment is needed to understand the economic potential for utilizing potentially lower-cost but lower-quality, high-protein microalgae for biorefinery conversion. Results: In this work, we conduct rigorous TEA modeling to assess the economic viability of two conceptual technology pathways for processing proteinaceous algae into a suite of fuels and products. One approach, termed mild oxidative treatment and upgrading (MOTU), makes use of a series of thermo-catalytic operations to upgrade solubilized proteins and carbohydrates to hydrocarbon fuels, while another alternative focuses on the biological conversion of those substrates to oxygenated fuels in the form of mixed alcohols (MA). Both pathways rely on the production of polyurethanes from unsaturated fatty acids and valorization of unconverted solids for use as a material for synthesizing bioplastics. The assessment found similar, albeit slightly higher fuel yields and lower costs for the MA pathway, translating to a residual solids selling price of $899/ton for MA versus $1033/ton for MOTU as would be required to support a $2.50/gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE) fuel selling price. A variation of the MA pathway including subsequent upgrading of the mixed alcohols to hydrocarbon fuels (MAU) reflected a required solids selling price of $975/ton. Conclusion: The slight advantages observed for the MA pathway are partially attributed to a boundary that stops at oxygenated fuels versus fungible drop-in hydrocarbon fuels through a more complex MOTU configuration, with more comparable results obtained for the MAU scenario. In either case, it was shown that an integrated algal biorefinery can be economical through optimal strategies to utilize and valorize all fractions of the biomass. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 41; Correspondence Address: M.

Microalgal biofuels are produced using sunlight, water, and simple salt minerals. Their high growth rate, photosynthesis, and carbon dioxide sequestration capacity make them one of the most important biorefinery platforms. Furthermore, microalgae's ability to alter their metabolism in response to environmental stresses to produce relatively high levels of high-value compounds makes them a promising alternative to fossil fuels. As a result, microalgae can significantly contribute to long-term solutions to critical global issues such as the energy crisis and climate change. The environmental benefits of algal biofuel have been demonstrated by significant reductions in carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur oxide emissions. Microalgae-derived biomass has the potential to generate a wide range of commercially important high-value compounds, novel materials, and feedstock for a variety of industries, including cosmetics, food, and feed. This review evaluates the potential of using microalgal biomass to produce a variety of bioenergy carriers, including biodiesel from stored lipids, alcohols from reserved carbohydrate fermentation, and hydrogen, syngas, methane, biochar and bio-oils via anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, and gasification. Furthermore, the potential use of microalgal biomass in carbon sequestration routes as an atmospheric carbon removal approach is being evaluated. The cost of algal biofuel production is primarily determined by culturing (77%), harvesting (12%), and lipid extraction (7.9%). As a result, the choice of microalgal species and cultivation mode (autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic) are important factors in controlling biomass and bioenergy production, as well as fuel properties. The simultaneous production of microalgal biomass in agricultural, municipal, or industrial wastewater is a low-cost option that could significantly reduce economic and environmental costs while also providing a valuable remediation service. Microalgae have also been proposed as a viable candidate for carbon dioxide capture from the atmosphere or an industrial point source. Microalgae can sequester 1.3 kg of carbon dioxide to produce 1 kg of biomass. Using potent microalgal strains in efficient design bioreactors for carbon dioxide sequestration is thus a challenge. Microalgae can theoretically use up to 9% of light energy to capture and convert 513 tons of carbon dioxide into 280 tons of dry biomass per hectare per year in open and closed cultures. Using an integrated microalgal bio-refinery to recover high-value-added products could reduce waste and create efficient biomass processing into bioenergy. To design an efficient atmospheric carbon removal system, algal biomass cultivation should be coupled with thermochemical technologies, such as pyrolysis. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 211; Correspondence Address: A.I.

Bio-CO2 emission reduction has received more and more attention as an environmentally sustainable approach. Microalgae are very popular in this regard because of excellent speed of growth, low costs of production, and resistance to extreme environments. Besides, most microalgae can undergo photosynthesis, where the CO2 and solar energy can be converted into sugar, and subsequently become biomass, providing a renewable and promising biofuel strategy with a few outstanding benefits. This review focuses on presenting CO2 sequestration by microalgae towards wastewater treatment and biodiesel production. First, the CO2 fixation mechanism by microalgae viz., sequestration and assimilation of CO2 in green microalgae as well as cyanobacteria were introduced. Besides, factors affecting CO2 sequestration in microalgae, containing microalgae species and cultivation conditions, such as light condition, photobioreactor, configuration, pH, CO2 concentration, temperature, and medium composition, were then comprehensively discussed. Special attention was given to the production of biodiesel as third-generation biofuel from various wastewater (CO2 biofixation), including processing steps of biodiesel production by microalgae, biodiesel production from wastewater, and improved methods. Furthermore, current life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) used in biodiesel production were discussed. Finally, the research challenges and specific prospects were considered. Taken together, this review provides useful and updated information to facilitate the development of microalgal “green chemistry” and “environmental sustainability”. © 2021","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 128; Correspondence Address: S.-H.

The potential of microalgae to perform photosynthesis and accumulate lipids make them suitable candidates for lipid production. Biofuel production from various single oleaginous microorganisms is already in practice. However, the high cost of biomass harvesting, extraction of lipids, and contamination issues are significant challenges of biofuel bioprocess commercialization. Recent microalgal co-culture studies showed considerable potential for easy biomass harvesting and reduction in overall energy consumption cost. Therefore, microalgal co-culture could be an alternative to overcome these constraints and enhance biomass and lipid production. Additionally, the integration of the nutrient sequestration process from potential agro-industrial wastewater using microalgal co-culture can reduce the cost of the substrate requirement for cultivation as well as ecological load. The co-culture in wastewater has shown excellent total phosphate removal efficiencies by microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana and yeast Rhodotorula glutinis, nitrogen removal by microalgae C. sorokiniana with activated sludge, and ammonium-nitrogen removal by C. vulgaris and fungi Aspergillus sp. co-culture. This review summarized the current advances towards biofuel and its value-added production from various microalgae co-culture and compared it with monoculture fermentation. It also includes some critical challenges of co-culturing for the economically viable bioprocess development for biofuel production. Furthermore, techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of co-culture technology were also discussed for biofuel production feasibility from microalgal co-culture. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 78; Correspondence Address: S.

This third-generation biofuel has great performance of combustion and can reduce emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, its production is currently very expensive, relative to petrochemical diesel. Development and implementation of strategies to optimize productivity and quality of biomass and thus ensure this future-proof biofuel is economically feasible to fabricate and competitive with diesel oil on an industrial scale is challenging. This meta-analytic overview documents the diversity of fastest-growing, oil-accumulating microalgae; performance of cultures and systems; strategies for inducing lipids; and quality and economics of microalgal biodiesel. The microalgae, Neochloris oleoabundans, Scenedesmus obliquus, Desmodesmus sp., and Micractinium sp., are hyperaccumulators of lipids. The genre, Micractinium sp., is a thermophile, and thus it can resist hydrothermal streams. Complementarily, it is the fastest to grow and the most productive in both biomass and biodiesel. This should be of great importance to roll-out sustainable, high-performance algal systems in marginal lands in tropical zones, where the heat often makes the planning and management of projects difficult and expensive. Heat shock, nutritional starvation, and photoperiod are the most effective algae-specific strategies for inducing mechanisms for lipogenesis in Ankistrodesmus dimorphus, Chlorella vulgaris and Leptolyngbya sp., Cylindrotheca closterium and N. oleoabundans, and Amphora subtropica and Dunaliella sp., respectively. Rhodococcus sp. produces a significant amount of biomass at very low cost, relative to diesel oil.

Firstly, it is essential to identify the main problems arising from fossil fuel production and consumption, which will enable the search and implementation of technological, sustainable, and economical alternatives to mitigate the current issue. With the modern technological advances in this specific area, the use of biofuels has expanded, given their high potential of production from diverse classes of biomass. Producing biodiesel from microalgae oil specifically, as a way of obtaining clean and renewable energy, can play a significant role in this context, and the process is of high interest to the energy sector. Biodiesels are produced through mixtures of ethyl esters or fatty acid methyl esters, which are generated by the synthesis of oil with alcohol in the presence of the enzyme alcohol lipase. There are clear challenges linked to the new technologies employed to obtain biofuels from microalgae, and there also are strong prospects to these approaches, since they are very energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Thus being, the present review describes the main aspects associated with biodiesel production from microalgae, highlighting the fundamentals of the technique, the immobilization processes followed, the use of solvents to optimize reaction media, bioreactor systems, as well as the performance optimization of microalgae biodiesel-based engines, while considering important economic and environmental aspects. Future trends in the biofuel scientific research and industry are also included, aiming at fostering discussions on the development of other significant advances in the use of microalgae lipase and oil technology for biodiesel production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 122; Correspondence Address: J.C.S. dos Santos; Institute of Engineering and Sustainable Development, Universidade da Integração Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira, Redenção, Campus das Auroras, CEP 62790970, Brazil; email: jcs@unilab.edu.br | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ellen""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.algal.2021.102616,Catalytic activity;Economic aspects;Lipase biocatalyst;Microalgae;Microalgae biodiesel,,

Because of the worldwide energy crises, the future of microalgal biorefinery is attentively receiving prominence. Despite being renewable and carbon–neutral, microalgal-based technology produces net CO2 emissions. Due to poor market pricing for renewable fuels, current biomass conversion techniques are neither profitable nor long-term viable. The microalgal strain chosen is critical to the experiment's success. A comprehensive approach that considers all three aspects of environmental sustainability is required to successfully address these challenges. The process should never be jeopardized in any way that threatens its long-term viability. The issue of sustainability must therefore be addressed from the outset of every biorefinery project. It is necessary to investigate genetically altered microalgal strains with improved lipid content, light usage efficiency, pigment accumulation, and other features during the design phase of an algal-based biorefinery, among other things. This is due to the recent drop in crude oil prices, as well as the significant capital and investment costs associated with algae cultivation. Dewatering, harvesting, and lipid recovery must all be researched and developed at a low cost. To solve the problem of decreasing biomass productivities at bigger production scales, a new generation of photobioreactor designs, lighting strategies, and nutrient feed systems are required. To be successful, proponents of large-scale microalgae-based biorefineries must integrate social and sustainability sciences into their commercial plans. The current review explores the potential application of algal biomass for the production of biofuels and bio-based products.

This study provides an updated review on microalgae to investigate the interaction between the food-energy-water-environment (FEWE) sectors and understand how to manage their challenges effectively. Concerns about food, energy, and water security, as well as challenges, such as climate change, local agrochemical manufacturing, the threat of synthetic pigments, non-degradable plastics and surfactants, thermal pollution, and the demand for livestock and aquafeed, need a platform that can respond to the goals of these four sectors simultaneously. A biorefinery platform as a cost-effective and innovative solution for the FEWE nexus has been proposed. To reduce costs, waste streams and effluent flue gas from plants should be fed into the cultivation media, making the biorefinery platform location sensitive. This review summarizes the challenges and the new techniques in converting microalgae into different types of biofuels, heat, electricity, and other value-added products such as bioplastics, pigments, surfactants, cosmetics, and food products.

The depleting fossil fuel reserves and increasing emission of greenhouse gases have raised the concern for the pursuit of alternative sustainable fuels. Bioethanol can potentially accomplish the need for a substitute for petroleum fuel. However, ascertaining environment-friendly and renewable feedstock for bioethanol is one of the major constraints towards commercialization. Due to the unsustainable approaches of the first two generation feedstocks, the incorporation of marine microalgae, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, as third-generation feedstock for bioethanol production has been broadly considered by the researchers. Vast resources, the capability to grow in non-potable seawater, and the presence of unique metabolites ascertain marine microalgae for the major drive over its freshwater counterparts in the bioethanol industry. Despite being a promising one, research on marine-based bioethanol production is still in its infancy. This review thus highlights the prospects of marine microalgae for bioethanol production along with different hydrolysis and fermentation techniques for biomass conversion. An insight into the economically sustainable cultivation and harvesting methods, strategy for carbohydrate augmentation for a revolutionary advancement in bioethanol production have also been discussed.

The current state of art technologies produces biodiesel from microalgal biomass attributed to high intrinsic neutral-lipid contents. However, persisting hurdles in terms of techno-economic feasibility have impeded commercial-scale operations. The latent qualities of microalgae towards the accumulation of multiple high-value products ranging from animal feed to pharmaceuticals adds up to the economic feasibility. Alternatively, the high abundant carbohydrate contents of microalgal strains are used as low-cost substrates for the growth of commercially important microbes to synthesize biofuels. Novel carbohydrate enhancement strategies such as two-stage cultivation, phytohormones, starvation strategies, combinatorial stress strategies, etc., are frequently emerging to mitigate the challenges. Therefore, this study targets to review the recent trends in tuning the microalgal metabolism for increased carbohydrates and associated biofuel generation to attain process feasibility and sustainability. According to recent reports, nitrogen limitation, phosphate limitation, the optimal light intensity with reduced dissolved oxygen, limited inorganic carbon, optimal organic carbon levels, and indole-3-acetic acid augmented the carbohydrate productivity in different microalgal strains. Further analysis on different pretreatment methods highlighted electric-based physical treatment strategies with high efficiencies and less energy requirements of 13.3 kJ to 1.5 MJ per kg biomass. The production cost for microalgae-based bioethanol varies from US$ 1.67 to 31.36 per gallon for different process scenarios, which needs further attention. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 114; Correspondence Address: M.

This will have a serious impact on the environment and human body, such as land desertification, increase in ocean acidity, sea level rise, and increase in pests and diseases; affect people's normal work and rest; and make people feel dizzy and nauseated. Excessive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main component of the greenhouse gas, have contributed to the continued rise in Earth's temperature. Although the world is vigorously developing clean energy to reduce carbon emissions, it will not replace fossil fuels in the short term. The conversion of biomass into energy is the most important way of energy utilization. Biomass energy refers to the solar energy stored in biomass in the form of chemical energy and is the fourth major energy source after oil, coal, and natural gas. At present, biofuels have gone through three developmental stages, which can be divided into first-generation biofuels, second-generation biofuels, and third-generation biofuels according to the types of raw materials and development history. The first generation of biofuels produced from food crops, such as bioethanol derived from sucrose and starch, has already entered the energy market. However, because the first generation of biofuels uses food crops as raw materials, there is a phenomenon of ""competing with people for food,""and it is difficult to achieve large-scale application. To avoid the problem of food shortages, second-generation biofuels produced from nonfood crops, such as wood fiber, have been developed. Microalgae biomass energy is favored by governments and scholars all over the world because of its unique advantages of fast reproduction speed and high oil content. The cultivation of microalgae does not occupy traditional farmland, and the marginal land such as mountains, oceans, and deserts can cultivate microalgae, or develop microalgae cultivation in the air through the innovation of microalgae photosynthetic reactors. When municipal wastewater, food industry wastewater, and aquaculture wastewater are used as the medium for large-scale cultivation of microalgae, and waste gas from biogas power generation, flue gas from coal power plants, and industrial waste gas from fermentation are used as the CO2 gas source for large-scale cultivation of microalgae, it can be further reduced. The comprehensive production cost of microalgae bioenergy plays a significant emission reduction effect. Combining the above advantages, the use of microalgae to produce first- or second-generation bioenergy has become a new research direction.

Although microalgae are a feasible source of biofuel, industrial microalgae applications face energy and cost challenges. To overcome these challenges, researchers have been interested in applying the bio-refinery approach to extract the important components encapsulated in microalgae. This review discusses the key steps of microalgae-based biorefinery including cultivation and harvesting, cell disruption, biofuel and value-added compound extraction along with the detailed technologies associated with each step of biorefinery. This review found that suitable microalgae species are selected based on their carbohydrate, lipid and protein contents and selecting the suitable species are crucial for high-quality biofuel and value-added products production. Microalgae species contain carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in the range of 8% to 69.7%, 5% to 74% and 7% to 65% respectively which proved their ability to be used as a source of value-added commodities in multiple industries including agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, culinary, and cosmetics. This review suggests that lipid and value-added products from microalgae can be made more economically viable by integrating upstream and downstream processes. Therefore, a systematically integrated genome sequencing and process-scale engineering approach for improving the extraction of lipids and co-products is critical in the development of future microalgal biorefineries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 336; Correspondence Address: M.

The manufacturing of biodiesel with renewable feedstocks and enzymes as catalysts can be supported commercially; however, studies into enhancing performance may be beneficial. Biodiesel gives a sustainable possibility to address the socio-economic and sustainable fuel problems. For competitive biodiesel, massive studies have been focused on growing new and sustainable biodiesel manufacturing technology to enhance productivity. Recently, fourth-generation biofuels (FGBs), genetically modified (GM) algae biomass, have attracted much interest from educational and business communities. However, changing FGBs with mineral assets stays fraught with many demanding situations. In particular, the technical elements of genetic engineering features want to be specified. However, little or no interest has been paid to GM algae biomass. Algal Genetics has a restricted quantity of development views and demanding situations dealing with FGBs.

The search for cost-effective and environmental-friendly bio-jet fuels derived from natural resources is gaining momentum. The microalgae cultivation conditions including temperature, pH, light intensity and nutrients have shown significant influence on the microalgae growth rate and chemical composition, which create the opportunities to enhance the yield and quality of microalgae bio-jet fuel. This review is focused on the hydroprocessing method for converting microalgae oil into bio-jet fuel, as well as the novel conceptual approaches for bio-jet fuel production such as gasification with Fischer-Tropsch and sugar-to-jet. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of biomass is one of the best alternative ways to replace natural aviation fuel due to the high maximum energy efficiency and low emission of greenhouse gas. In addition, hydroprocessing with the aid of Ni and zeolites catalysts has successfully converted the microalgae biodiesel to bio-jet fuel with high yield and alkane selectivity. Among these techniques, hydroprocessing used the lowest production cost with the longest duration, whereas the bio-jet fuel with high selectivity (C8–C16) could be produced by using gasification with the Fischer-Tropsch process. Consequently, gasification and Fischer-Tropsch and sugar-to-jet can become the future alternative process to convert microalgae to bio-jet fuel.

Nevertheless, the successful exploitation of microalgae as biofactories for industrial scale is dependent on choosing the right microalga and optimum growth conditions. Due to the rich biodiversity of microalgae, a screening pipeline should be developed to perform microalgal strain selection exploring their growth, robustness, and metabolite production. Current prospects in microalgal biotechnology are turning their focus to high-value lipids for pharmaceutic, nutraceutic, and cosmetic products. Within microalgal lipid fraction, polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids are broadly recognized for their vital functions in human organisms. Microalgal-derived phytosterols are still an underexploited lipid resource despite presenting promising biological activities, including neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, neuromodulatory, immunomodulatory, and apoptosis inductive effects. To modulate microalgal biochemical composition, according to the intended field of application, it is important to know the contribution of each cultivation factor, or their combined effects, for the wanted product accumulation. Microalgae have a vital role to play in future low-carbon economy.

However, several challenges about microalgae’s cultivation, harvesting, pre-treatment and extraction processes as well as the technology of biodiesel production affect its sustainability. This study proffers solutions to these challenges and recommended that hybrid culture systems with genetically engineered microalgal species would overcome the challenges of cultivation. The coagulation/flocculation method was adjudged the best harvesting process of the microalgae for its sustainability for biodiesel production. The pre-treatment by ultrasound coupled with enzymatic extraction was suggested best, due to their numerous advantages over other methods. A novel integrated ultrasound-enzyme-enzyme in-situ pre-treatment-extraction-transesterification design is considered a sustainable approach to utilising microalgae biomass for biodiesel production. The study concludes that the microalgae biomass is more than sufficient to meet the global energy demand and can be economically harnessed as a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. HIGHLIGHTS • Microalgae contain sufficient characteristics for their sustainability for biodiesel production. • Implementation of genetic strategies of microalgal species by cultivating in a hybrid system is the key to microalgae sustainability. • Harvesting of microalgae by coagulation/flocculation method would promote its efficient lipid recovery. • Microalgae are novel feedstocks with a rigid cell wall, its lipid extraction requires the use of effective and efficient pretreatment. • The ultrasound-enzymatic extraction and enzymatic transesterification in an in-situ process can sustainably utilise microalgae biomass for biodiesel production. © 2022, University of Ilorin, Faculty of Engineering and Technology.

To overcome these problems, algae can be acts as one of the potent sources for biofuels feedstocks as well as biosorbents for wastewater treatment. The cultivation of microalgae leads to the removal of nutrients, heavy metals, dyes, and pharmaceutical waste from wastewater. Extracted lipids from microalgae are utilized for biodiesel production and lipid extracted microalgae can act as feedstocks for the production of bioethanol, biobutanol, and biogas. Biochar formed from microalgae can act as biosorbents. Several factors like temperature, the intensity of light, CO2, nutrient concentration, and inoculum size affect the cultivation of microalgae. Dynamic models are proposed for algal growth kinetics in raceway ponds and photobioreactors. Similarly, biomass concentration, initial pH, contact time, temperature, initial metal and dyes concentration, etc. affect the biosorption process. Biosorption isotherm kinetics are employed for heavy metals and dyes removal from wastewater.

Among sustainable energy sources, microalgae represent a promising alternative to fossil fuel and contribute to the achievement of important Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, the potential contribution of marine microalgae to sustainable development is large as, among other benefits, they represent a carbon negative energy source and may be applied in many coastal areas around the world. Despite this, significant economic and technological improvements are needed in order to make microalgae biofuels viable on a large scale. This review aims to explore how and to what extent third‐generation biofuels (marine microalgae, but also the latest advances in freshwater microalgae) can benefit the realization of these SDGs. From this study we concluded that the production of large‐scale marine microalgae biofuels is not yet feasible from the economic perspective at a large scale. However, the cultivation of microalgae in seawater holds great potential for increasing the small to medium viability of this biofuel source. The possibilities for improvement along with the contributions to sustainable development lay the groundwork for continuing to study and apply the potential of sustainable production of microalgae bioenergy. © 2021 by the authors.

The trends and perspectives of advanced biofuels including techno-economic and policy analysis are discussed and examined to evaluate future development. The biofuel properties are directly influenced by feedstock compositions and manufacturing processes. The wide exploitation and application of lignocellulose feedstocks are dominant steps for providing sufficient alternative fuel in global biofuel market. The application potentials of major algae strains for advanced biofuel production are critically analyzed. New types of biofuel should be globally recognized by sustainability criteria and certification. The development of advanced conversion and purification techniques to increase the economic value of byproducts enhances the competitiveness of biofuels. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are considered the most promising feedstocks for various types of advanced biofuel. Genetic modification of algae or bacterial strains and co-cultivation of various microorganisms are found to be effective for growing the required chemical compounds and satisfying the required fuel characteristics. In addition, thermochemical and biochemical conversions are found to be two of the most competitive processes for the production of advanced generation biofuels.

Besides being at the verge of getting exhausted fossil fuels are major contributors of greenhouse gases to the environment. This led to the expedition for sustainable and renewable energy source and researchers found microalgae an over overwhelmingly rich source of renewable energy, which are termed as tiny biorefineries. Microalgae are the eukaryotic /prokaryotic organisms having the capabilities of fixing carbon (1 kg of algal biomass can fix about 1.5 kg of CO2) photosynthetically (8.3 % photosynthetic efficiency). The diversified nature of different genera of microalgae allows them to be grown in varying cultivating conditions i.e., high ammonia acidic/basic pH, varied salinity, high/low temperatures. Microalgae are regarded as third generation feedstock in the production of algal biomass which is a source of biofuels and other value-added products. The cost effectiveness is the criterion where microalgae-based biofuels lose the ground to fossil fuels since the cost of cultivation and harvesting is high. But the cost issue can be suppressed if microalgae is cultivated coupled with wastewater resulting in the resource recovery and biomass production at the same time. This can be achieved by blending biorefinery with bioeconomy. Biorefinery paves the way to obtain biofuels and other green chemicals from microalgal biomass and circular bioeconomy directs the best optimum utilization of the obtained microalgal biomass for sustainable and environmentally friendly system. As it promotes the primary objectives of the circular bioeconomy (i.e., reduce and reuse). Valorization of a single product from microalgal biomass is not valued, as it restrains the economic viability, while multiple products from microalgal biomass which are commercially in demand and are environmentally sustainable can compensate the economy. Consolidating bioeconomy in microalgal biorefinery can improve cost-effectiveness and process efficiency, together with resource recovery. This mini review focusses on the primary components of the circular bioeconomy in context of the high pollutants/nutrient composition of different wastewaters.

To elucidate the research status timely and future trends in biochar field, CiteSpace is used to systematically analyze the related literature retrieved from the Web of Science core collection in 2019. Based on the keywords clustering analysis, it was found that “biochar production”, “organic pollutants removal”, “heavy metals immobilization”, “bioremediation” were the main hotspots in research covering biochar. “Bioremediation” is an emerging topic and deserves extensive attention due to its highly effective and environmentally friendly treatment of pollutants. Improving the phytoremediation effect, immobilizing functional microorganisms on biochar, and using microorganisms as raw materials to produce biochar were the common methods of biochar-assisted bioremediation. While studies focused on “soil quality and plant growth” and “biochar and global climate change” decreased, investigations concentrated in the toxicity of biochar to soil biota and ruminants are sustainably growing. Research on direct and catalytic thermal pyrolysis of green waste (mainly microalgae) for biofuels (bio-oil, biodiesel, syngas, etc.) and biochar production is increasing. Converting municipal wastes (e.g., sewage sludge, fallen leaves) into biochar through pyrolysis was a suitable treatment for municipal waste and became a popular topic in recent time. Moreover, the biochar produced from these municipal wastes exhibited excellent performance in the removal of pollutants from wastewater and soil. This review may help to identify future directions in biochar research and applications. © 2020, Shenyang Agricultural University.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 97; Correspondence Address: Y.

This review discusses the development of a biorefinery model using sustainable feedstocks such as microalgal biomass, with multiple benefits. As a case study, it demonstrates the development of a microalgal biorefinery to produce lipid for biofuel and carotenoids like lutein for healthcare applications, along with CO2 mitigation. However, there has been a question mark regarding the economic viability of microalgal biorefinery, mainly for low biomass and product yields and discrete downstream processing steps. To provide sustainable solutions for these technological challenges, process intensification strategies can be implemented to enhance the yields of biomass-derived biofuels and value-added products. This article investigates the design aspects of photo-bioreactors to enhance biomass productivity and CO2 sequestration. Despite efforts made by researchers to improve product yields, there is ample scope to improve the economic viability of lutein and lipid production by integrating upstream and downstream operations to reduce the cost associated with the process. The future of algal biorefineries will rely on the development of rationally integrated genome and process-scale engineering strategies to improve further the production of lipid and carotenoids.

Agricultural and food residues represent low-cost abundant and renewable sources of organic carbon that can be valorized for the cultivation of microalgae, while converting them from an environmental liability to an industrial asset. Biochemical treatment of such residues results in the release of various sugars, primarily glucose, sucrose, fructose, arabinose, and xylose along with other nutrients, such as trace elements. These sugars and nutrients can be metabolized in the absence of light (heterotrophic) or the presence of light (mixotrophic) by a variety of microalgae species for biomass and bioproduct production.

The application of biodiesel as fuel-blend has been implemented commercially in transport sector in the country. Among various potential feedstock for biodiesel production, microalgae have been appeared as a promising source since a decade due to its' high biomass productivity, rapid growth rate, large amount of lipid content, capability of high CO2 capture and sequestration as well as suitable geographical location to be harvested. The main objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of microalgae harvesting in Malaysia to produce biodiesel and potential to implement microalgae-biodiesel as commercial transportation fuel. This study demonstrated the current scenario of overall biodiesel production and application in Malaysia. Since Malaysia is the world's second-largest oil palm producer, exploitation of edible palm oil for the making of biodiesel is to be blamed as the cause of soaring food price; therefore, the country is currently looking for 3rd generation biofuel sources and microalgae has been preferred for this purpose. Therefore, insight of the significance of microalgae cultivation for this purpose, suitable microalgae candidates and possible feasibility of microalgae biodiesel have been delineated in this review study. Prospects and challenges to implement microalgae biodiesel have also been emphasized in this study. Therefore, the advantages and limitations of this biodiesel can be transparent to government and non-government sectors. Thus, this study can re-direct both sectors in future. Consequently, it may contribute setting an appropriate government policy to encourage microalgae for biodiesel production to sustain the local biofuel and secure economic growth, energy security and improve environmental conditions in near future. © 2020 The Authors","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 67; Correspondence Address: N.

However, biofuel compounds including lipid, carbohydrate, and hydrogen are not sufficiently produced by microalgae under normal conditions; therefore economical viability of microalgal biofuel production has not reached the ultimate stage of commercial viability. In order to overcome the above limitation, various stress conditions have been applied on microalgae to boost lipid, carbohydrate and hydrogen production. Even though stress conditions increases the production of biofuel compounds, microalgae growth is severely affected. In this regard, a two-stage cultivation mode wherein first stage involving high biomass production under media optimized heterotrophic condition and second stage involving lipid, carbohydrate and hydrogen accumulation under stress integrated phototrophic mode is considered as a potential route for biofuel production in microalgae. The present review critically evaluates various two-stage strategies adopted in microalgal biofuel production by comparing lipid, carbohydrate and hydrogen productivities with that of single stage cultivation.

The production of microalgal biomass using the currently available technologies costs approximately $4.92 kg−1, which is unacceptably high for biodiesel production. The challenges lie in high biomass production cost and unfavorable energetic balance and significant process, and engineering advancements are desirable before mass-scale production of algal oil and biodiesel at a cost-competitive price is realized. On the other hand, various high-value products sourced from microalgae are already commercialized. The biomass production cost of $4.92 kg−1is more than acceptable if such products are also derived which, according to some estimates, may command a price as high as $123 kg−1 biomass. It is expected that with process modifications and engineering advancements, the biomass production cost can be brought down to as low as $0.50 kg−1. Moreover, coupling phycoremediation of pollution loads in waste streams to microalgal biomass production offers economic (up to $170 t−1 biomass produced) and environmental gains (90% reduction in water footprint, improved GHG balance, and a substantial reduction in external input of fertilizers).

The second is to assess the economic impact of algae production systems on the dairy farms potentially interested in Southern Italy. The analysis was performed using financial and economic indicators and considering two system management scenarios, namely single and collective. Our results confirm that current microalgae production technology favors biofuel only as a co-product and that the production of high-value co-products improve profitability and net income in Southern Italian dairy farms, either in single or collective management.

Due to this fact, researchers look for alternative energy sources to satisfy the need of the current generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. As a result, nowadays the production of energy from biological sources is highly applicable and takes advantage of fossil fuel due to the limited impact on the environment. On the other hand, food cost, land use for some other purposes, and carbon emissions have risen due to the increased production of first-generation bioethanol. Even though the second-generation bioethanol from lignocellulose agricultural waste solved this problem, it again faced difficulties-to-overcome technological barriers. This, in turn, pushed researchers to come up with another alternative called the third-generation biofuel production. The renewed promise is held in microalgae biomass as an alternative feedstock.

Microalgae are likewise utilized to extract high-value products such as pigments, anti-oxidants and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which are useful in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry. These compounds can be extracted simultaneously or sequentially after biodiesel extraction to reduce the total expenditure involved in the process.

This strategy is ideal for converting biomass into a variety of food, chemical, pharmaceutical, and energy products. This last, in turn, represents the main step towards the production of alternative fuels, such as biodiesel, which still has a high production cost and, therefore, prevents market concurrence against the resilient fossil fuels. In this sense, the objective of this review is to critically address the issues related to biodiesel facilities to make them commercially competitive. The consolidated biorefineries (soybean, palm, rapeseed, and sunflower) and the emergent biorefineries (jatropha, microalgae, yeast, and activated sludge) were presented and discussed with the focus in the multiproduct refining. Based on the data analysis and interpretation compiled in this review, biorefineries are not economically viable against the robustness of the main competitor, the oil refineries. In terms of availability of feedstocks, consolidated biorefineries depend on public policy action, while the emerging ones depend on research and development.

In addition, the CO2 present in the atmosphere is captured and sequestered long term in the form of biochar would help to attain carbon negativity, while remediating wastewater and balancing energy requirements.

The various species of microalgae commonly used as biodiesel feedstock was critically assessed, particularly on high lipid content species. The production of microalgae biodiesel via direct conversion from biomass was systematically discussed, covering major enhancements such as heterogeneous catalysts, the use of ultrasonic and microwave- techniques and supercritical alcohols that focus on the overall improvement of biodiesel production.

Due to the energy-intensive and cost barrier of physical harvesting techniques, chemical methods entailing organic, inorganic, and electroflocculation have come to limelight and in this regard, microalgae used, floc recovery and the dose of flocculants have been compared and presented in detail. Further, state of the art harvesting techniques viz., bioflocculation by microalgae/bacteria, flocculation by pH adjustment, and magnetic nanocomposite based microalgal harvesting had been critically articulated. Besides discussing the several methods, this paper has summarized the key challenges in conventional and advanced harvesting techniques and also provided the scope thereof.

However, several primary bottlenecks still exist in current technologies, including low biomass conversion efficiency, bio-invasion from the external environment, limited or costly nutrient sources, and high energy and capital input for harvest, and stalling its industrial progression. Coupling biofuel production with environmental treatment renders microalgae a more feasible feedstock. This review focuses on microalgae biotechnologies for both bioenergy generation and environmental treatment (e.g. CO2 sequestration and wastewater reclamation). Different intelligent technologies have been developed, especially during the last decade, to eliminate the bottlenecks, including mixotrophic/heterotrophic cultivation, immobilization, and co-cultivation. It has been realized that any single purpose for the cultivation of microalgae is not an economically feasible option. Combinations of applications in biorefineries are gradually reckoned to be necessary as it provides more economically feasible and environmentally sustainable operations. This presents microalgae as a special niche occupier linking the fields of energy and environmental sciences and technologies.

There are several measures on different levels to reduce the global warming including clean energies from wind, solar, and biomass. There are different aspects in bringing these technologies into a reality including development of technology, economic feasibilities, environmental sustainability and finally, support from the government in the form of effective policies and public awareness. Adequate R&D efforts could overcome all the factors but only an effective policy could drive those efforts to reality. Therefore, in this connection this review initially addresses the present state of energy demand, progression of biofuel sources and the bottlenecks in microalgal biofuel production and commercialization. The biofuel policies are essential to change the world's dependence on fossil fuels for a better tomorrow. Hence, this review addresses the salient features of National Biofuel Policy of India that helps in regulating the biofuels production and their marketing. As a part of Policy implementation, government of India introduced several schemes and programs in last two-decades, which includes mandate blending of ethanol with gasoline, diesel with biodiesel, for the future clean energy vision, and incentivizing bio-based products/fuels. In addition, participation of both federal and state governments for clean energy initiatives, capital investments and tax credits were described in detail. Many policies lack easy outreach among public and industries, which needs marketing by the government that secures a clean energy future in India. Though India is in the process of evolution, it might be quite difficult to enact a dedicative legislation to deal with the challenges of biofuel marketing.

Recent research focussed mainly on the technological feasibility of various separation processes. However, to what extent these innovative harvesting strategies have been commercialized and therefore have led to actual innovation in the current microalgae biotech industry by the creation of intellectual property, has remained unexplored. This study reviews the scientific literature based on technological, economical and environmental criteria of 13 primary and 8 secondary harvesting methods. Commercial deployment was evaluated via patent analysis. Auto- and co-flocculation, as well as sedimentation, overall scored best for economic (CAPEX and OPEX) and environmental (energy and GHG) criteria, while belt filters scored the highest on the technological criteria (TSS). Hence, only 4 patents based on auto-/co-flocculation, sedimentation and only two for belt filtration are still in force. Technologies based on organic, electrolytic and magnetic flocculation seem to be more successfully patented. Since patenting involves making the technology freely available for others, small but sometimes crucial improvements in low-tech systems may be often kept as a company secret instead. So far, no single harvesting process with superior feasibility has emerged for application on a large commercial scale.

The natural petroleum can not catch-up the current consumption rate, which is already reported to be 105 times faster than nature can create. Besides, the use of fossil fuels is devastating to our environment through greenhouse gas emissions and consequent global warming. Therefore, the search for ‘clean’ energy has become the most overwhelming challenges. Currently, several alternatives are being studied and implemented. Biofuels, fuels from living organisms, provide environmental benefits, since their use leads to a decrease in the harmful emissions of CO2 and hydrocarbons and, to the elimination of SOx emissions, with a consequent decrease in the greenhouse effects. Unfortunately, the present biofuel projections are based on feed-stocks that are also food commodities and resources suitable for conventional agriculture. One possibility to overcome the problem is the cultivation of micro-algae and switching to third generation biofuels, which seem to be a promising source since algae are able to efficiently convert sunlight, water, and CO2 into a variety of products suitable for renewable energy applications. Therefore, this review is intended to recapitulate current works on micro-algal biofuel production potential and discuss possible ways to put it into practice. This review starts by highlighting the advantages and various forms of micro-algal biofuels. Some of the micro-algal species proved to be suitable for biofuel production so far are considered, with particular emphasis on Scenedesmus obliquus. The recent attempts and achievements in improving the economies of production through genetic and metabolic engineering of micro-algal strains are also addressed. Other potential applications such as wastewater treatment and CO2 mitigation that can be coupled with biofuel production are described.

On-line and in-line monitoring of macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and high-value pigments will be more critical to maintain product quality and consistency for downstream processing in a biorefinery to maintain and valorize these markets. The main contribution of this review is to present current and prospective advances of on-line and in-line process analytical technology (PAT), with high-selectivity–the capability of monitoring several analytes simultaneously–in the interest of improving product quality, productivity, and process automation of a microalgal biorefinery. The high-selectivity PAT under consideration are mid-infrared (MIR), near-infrared (NIR), and Raman vibrational spectroscopies. The current review contains a critical assessment of these technologies in the context of recent advances in software and hardware in order to move microalgae production towards process automation through multivariate process control (MVPC) and software sensors trained on “big data”.

Diesel demand in Iran has increasingly grown due to the low price of diesel, a high subsidy, and an unsuitable consumption pattern. During 2006-2007, this growth imposed 2.2 billion liters of imports, which were equivalent to 7.5% of diesel production in 2007 and cost about $1.2 billion. Therefore, the government implemented fuel rationing in 2007 and a targeted subsidy law in 2010. These projects have not gained effective control of consumption due to the wide gap between the international diesel price and the domestic price. Diesel import after the implementation of fuel rationing and the targeted subsidy law in 2011 imposed 3.6 billion liters of import and cost about $2.2 billion. Therefore, the government will need fundamental strategies and policies to face and control the negative impact on the economy and the environment. Third generation fuels, biofuels, as another supplementary approach seems to have the capability to reduce the petroleum requirement. This paper investigates the potential of biodiesel as diesel alternative fuel from oil seeds and microalgae in Iran along with evaluating the policy for reducing diesel consumption. Dunaliella salina as an indigenous green microalga isolated from the Maharlu Salt Lake was cultivated in an integration of an airlift system and a raceway pond (IARWP) to prove microalgal potentials in Iran. Additionally, the natural culture medium from the Maharlu Salt Lake was utilized for Dunaliella salina in order to commercialize and reduce cultivation cost. Compared to oilseeds, microalgae because of their high lipid content have much potential to solve a fuel consumption problem.

This perspective paper first briefly discusses the latest advances in liquid transportation biodiesel production from microalgal biomass, including microalgal growth, biomass harvesting and drying, lipid extraction and biodiesel conversion. Subsequently, strategies for the future development of microalgal biodiesel have been proposed and discussed, in an attempt to reduce the cost gap. From the microalgal biodiesel production chain perspective, genetic and metabolic engineering, isolation of suitable species, high-efficiency bioreactor development, efficient culturing system development, optimal harvest process design, high-efficiency lipid extraction and transesterification method development will have critical roles to play. It is worthy of note that the increase of the outcome credits can also realize the reduction of the economic gap, and the main measures include appropriate glycerol recovery and reutilization, integration with wastewater treatment and CO2 mitigation together with microalgal biorefinery for the production of multiple co-products with high values.

Collectively, biofuels include any energy-enriched chemicals generated directly through the biological processes or derived from the chemical conversion from biomass of prior living organisms. Predominantly, biofuels are produced from photosynthetic organisms such as photosynthetic bacteria, micro- and macro-algae and vascular land plants. The primary products of biofuel may be in a gas, liquid, or solid form. These products can be further converted by biochemical, physical, and thermochemical methods. Biofuels can be classified into two categories: primary and secondary biofuels. The primary biofuels are directly produced from burning woody or cellulosic plant material and dry animal waste. The secondary biofuels can be classified into three generations that are each indirectly generated from plant and animal material. The first generation of biofuels is ethanol derived from food crops rich in starch or biodiesel taken from waste animal fats such as cooking grease. The second generation is bioethanol derived from non-food cellulosic biomass and biodiesel taken from oil-rich plant seed such as soybean or jatropha. The third generation is the biofuels generated from cyanobacterial, microalgae and other microbes, which is the most promising approach to meet the global energy demands. In this review, we present the recent progresses including challenges and opportunities in microbial biofuels production as well as the potential applications of microalgae as a platform of biomass production. Future research endeavors in biofuel production should be placed on the search of novel biofuel production species, optimization and improvement of culture conditions, genetic engineering of biofuel-producing species, complete understanding of the biofuel production mechanisms, and effective techniques for mass cultivation of microorganisms. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 564; Correspondence Address: B.D.

Plants or algae appear ideal since they can use sunlight to fix CO2 into usable fuel or fuel feedstocks. However, as the world population approaches the 1010 (10 billion) mark, the use of agricultural land to produce fuel instead of food cannot be justified. Microalgal biofuel production is under intense investigation due to its promise as a sustainable, renewable biofuel that can be produced using non-arable land and brackish or non-potable water. Some species accumulate high levels of TAGs (triacylglycerols) that can be converted to fatty acid esters suitable as replacement diesel fuels. However, there are many technical barriers to the practical application of microalgae for biofuel production and thus a number of significant challenges need to be met before microalgal biodiesel production becomes a practical reality. These include developing cost-effective cultivation strategies, low energy requiring harvesting technologies, and energy efficient and sustainable lipid conversion technologies. The large culture volumes that will be necessary dictate that the necessary nutrients come from wastewaters, such as the effluents from secondary treatment of sewage.

This paper served as a platform to critically review current production technologies of microalgae, ranging from cultivation, harvesting, extraction and several biofuels conversion processes. In addition, due to the high photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae, mass cultivation of microalgae is believed to be able to efficiently reduce the carbon dioxide emission to atmosphere and thus, reducing the impact of global warming. This is because microalgae have high growth rate and is able to develop maximum of 70% of lipid content within their cells depending on species. Apart from that, microalgae have the ability to survive under harsh condition and occupied smaller cultivation land area than other land crops. The harvested microalgae biomass can be used for electrical generation, while its crude lipid can be used as transportation fuel as it has 80% average energy content of petroleum. In the present paper, a detailed discussion to produce biodiesel, fuel gas, bio-oil, methane, hydrogen and alcohol from microalgae biomass are also included. Besides, updated research, challenges and the way forward of microalgae biofuels are also presented.

Mass cultivation of microalgae is the most overpriced and technically challenging step in microalgal biofuel generation. Wastewater is an available source of the water plus nutrients necessary for algae cultivation. Microalgae provide a cost-effective and sustainable means of advanced (waste)water treatment with the simultaneous production of commercially valuable products. Microalgae show higher efficiency in nutrient removal than other microorganisms because the nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, urea and trace elements) present in various wastewaters are essential for microalgal growth. Potential progress in the area of microalgal cultivation coupled with wastewater treatment in open and closed systems has led to an improvement in algal biomass production. However, significant efforts are still required for the development and optimization of a coupled system to simultaneously generate biomass and treat wastewater. In this review, the systematic description of the technologies required for the successful integration of wastewater treatment and cultivation of microalgae for biomass production toward biofuel generation was discussed. It deeply reviews the microalgae-mediated treatment of different wastewaters (including municipal, piggery/swine, industrial, and anaerobic wastewater), and highlight the wastewater characteristics suitable for microalgae cultivation. Various pretreatment methods (such as filtration, autoclaving, UV application, and dilution) needed for wastewater prior to its use for microalgae cultivation have been discussed. The selection of potential microalgae species that can grow in wastewater and generate a large amount of biomass has been considered. Discussion on microalgal cultivation systems (including raceways, photobioreactors, turf scrubbers, and hybrid systems) that use wastewater, evaluating the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) of each system was reported.

In this context, microalgae grown in salt-water and arid areas represent a promising sustainable chain for advanced biofuel production but, at the same time, they also represent a considerable challenge. Processing microalgae in an economic way into a viable and sustainable liquid biofuel (a low-cost mass-product) is not trivial. So far, the most studied microalgae-based biofuel chain is composed by microorganism cultivation, lipid accumulation, oil extraction, co-product valorization, and algae oil conversion through conventional esterification into Fatty Acids Methyl Esters (FAME), i.e. Biodiesel, or Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), the latter representing a very high quality drop-in biofuel (suitable either for road transport or for aviation). However, extracting the algae oil at low cost and industrial scale is not yet a mature process, and there is not yet industrial production of algae-biofuel from these two lipid-based chains. Another option can however be considered: processing the algae through dedicated thermochemical reactors into advanced biofuels, thus approaching the downstream processing of algae in a completely different way than separation. The present work examines the possible routes for thermochemical conversion of microalgae into liquid biofuels, distinguishing between dry-processes (namely Pyrolysis, PO) and wet-processes (near critical-water HydroThermal Liquefaction, HTL). A literature review on algae-HTL was carried out, distinguishing between batch and continuous experiments, and compared to original results from algae pyrolysis. In particular, pyrolysis was carried out on both starved (lipid-accumulated) and non-starved microalgae. Typical composition of major products is given for both PO and HTL, comparing the main characteristic of the products. Major engineering advantages and challenges in thermochemical conversion of algae into liquid biofuels were identified and discussed for both processes, in view of the production of a transport biofuel and the full exploitation of this renewable feedstock in energy and biorefinery complexes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 246; Correspondence Address: D.

A lot of research has been done in microalgal biology, culture, harvest, biofuel conversion and so forth. However, both academia and industry suggest that microalgae-based biofuel production is still in its infancy due to a lack of economic efficiency. Microalgae contain lipids, carbohydrates (starch and cellulose), proteins and a wide range of inorganic and organic molecules. These components can be converted into biofuels, feed, food and other high-value products such as cosmetics, fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Through microalgal biorefinery, multiple products (low-volume high-value bio-products and low-value high-volume biofuels) can be produced, thus maximising the value derived from microalgal biomass. However, some uncertainties with risks also exist during the process, and should be forecast well in advance and then minimised or even eliminated. The main challenges during microalgal biorefinery include water footprint, energy balance, production costs, market potential and policy influence. In an effort to mitigate these uncertainties, further research and development in the field is still required. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: L.-D.

To obtain a comprehensive and systematic overview of the current state of microalgal research, particularly microalgal biofuel research, we retrieved and analyzed manuscripts and patents related to this topic and published between 1900 and mid-2015. We found that there was a burst in microalgal biofuel research from 2006 to 2011 that significantly stimulated the development of microalgal biotechnology for the production of high value-added commodities and for environmental applications and microalgal mass culturing, in an attempt to make the entire process of biofuel production economically viable for industrialization. However, a lag in basic microalgal research has kept production costs high, resulting in a decline in investments, funding, and research efforts in the fields of microalgal biofuel production, microalgal biotechnology, and mass culturing since 2012. Based on a review of the challenges/problems of microalgae biofuel production and recent advances of their solution, the perspective view of the future R&D needs and trends were proposed. To bypass the price bottleneck of microalgae-based biofuel production, it has been proposed that energy-producing microalgal biotechnological applications be synergistically combined with microalgal biofuel production. Future investments and funding will most likely be directed toward basic studies that aim to elucidate the microorganisms' characteristics and toward the development of microalgal biotechnology and its environmental applications, which have potential economic and social benefits.

Modern cyanobacteria grow fast; they do not compete for agricultural lands and resources; they efficiently convert excessive amounts of CO2 into biomass, thus participating in both carbon fixation and organic chemical production. Many cyanobacterial species are easier to genetically manipulate than eukaryotic algae and other photosynthetic organisms.

Technology development and process optimization are necessary to minimize the overall production cost. Moreover, in the framework of process sustainability, social and environmental impacts should include process safety aspects. In this context, the objective of this work is to develop a biodiesel production process based on microalgae and the subsequent estimation of the associated risks, thus contributing to more sustainable and safe processes. The biodiesel biorefinery is optimized, taking into account alternative configurations for algae cultivation and lipid extraction. Algae cultivation options are open ponds and tubular photobioreactors. Regarding lipid extraction, dewatering and subsequent n-hexane extraction, and combined ethanol/n-hexane extraction are the studied alternatives. Numerical results showed that open ponds and n-hexane extraction provide maximum net present value. However, n-hexane consumption dramatically rises, and industrial hazards have not been considered in the optimization process. To overcome this issue, a preliminary hazard analysis is carried out to identify hazardous materials and operations. Event trees are formulated to derive the frequencies of different accident scenarios, further determining the consequences. The major consequences of accidents involve toxic releases of high quantities of n-hexane.

With an imperative need of CO2 reduction and considering the declining status of crude oil, governments in various countries have not only diverted substantial funds for biofuel projects but also have introduced incentives to vendors that produce biofuels. Currently, biodiesel production from microalgal biomass has drawn an immense importance with the potential to exclude high-quality agricultural land use and food safe-keeping issues. Moreover, microalgae can grow in seawater or wastewater and microalgal oil can exceed 50-60% (dry cell weight) as compared with some best agricultural oil crops of only 5-10% oil content. Globally, microalgae are the highest biomass producers and neutral lipid accumulators contending any other terrestrial oil crops. However, there remain many hurdles in each and every step, starting from strain selection and lipid accumulation/yield, algae mass cultivation followed by the downstream processes such as harvesting, drying, oil extraction, and biodiesel conversion (transesterification), and overall, the cost of production. Isolation and screening of oleaginous microalgae is one pivotal important upstream factor which should be addressed according to the need of freshwater or marine algae with a consideration that wild-type indigenous isolate can be the best suited for the laboratory to large scale exploitation. Nowadays, a large number of literature on microalgal biodiesel production are available, but none of those illustrate a detailed step-wise description with the pros and cons of the upstream and downstream processes of biodiesel production from microalgae. Specifically, harvesting and drying constitute more than 50% of the total production costs; however, there are quite a less number of detailed study reports available. In this review, a pragmatic and critical analysis was tried to put forward with the on-going researches on isolation and screening of oleaginous microalgae, microalgal large scale cultivation, biomass harvesting, drying, lipid extraction and finally biodiesel production. © 2016 Mallick, Bagchi, Koley and Singh.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 131; Correspondence Address: N.

In this paper, we expand the previous optimization framework by considering the processing of microalgae residue previously treated as wastes. We develop an expanded biorefinery superstructure model, based on which a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed to determine the optimal/promising biorefinery configurations with different choices of objective functions.

Main challenges are currently the feasibility of large-scale commercialization of microalgae biofuels, since there are still some technical problems to overcome (e.g. the high energy consumption associated with biomass processing) and the majority of economic and financial analyses are based on pilot-scale projects. Therefore, this article presents the results of a Delphi study aiming to identify the main obstacles and most critical issues affecting the potential of large-scale commercialization of microalgae biodiesel and its incorporation into the fuel market. According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first Delphi study with this objective. The respondents are worldwide market specialists in the survey themes that ranged from biofuels economics to their environmental sustainability. One of the key findings is that most of the experts believe that production of microalgae biofuels will achieve its full commercial scale until 2020, and that from 2021 till 2030 it could represent from 1% to 5% of the worldwide fuel consumption.

This is evidenced by a reduction in the discovery of new fossil fuel sources and the exploitation of more energy intense reserves such as shale gas and tar sands. As a result of this reality, biofuel research and development has progressed through several stages globally and within Canada. First and second generation bioethanol production currently dominates the market, leading to concerns over sustainability while only partially addressing the issue at hand. Third generation biofuel feedstocks, derived from microalgae and cyanobacteria, present the potential to address the short falls of both first and second generation feedstocks. Specifically, third generation biofuels offer increased productivity and the opportunity to sequester nutrients from waste streams whilst also expanding the biofuel pallet to include biodiesel, as well as other target compounds. However, third generation feedstocks remain a young technology that presents several limitations, including the lack of a complement of suitable traits within a single species. Moreover, common assumptions over the use of waste streams to improve productivity and sustainability may limit scalability. These, in turn, may limit development or dictate smaller regionally located processes. The presented manuscript demonstrates that in spite of their potential, mandates and funding support for third generation biofuel feedstocks are largely overlooked within Canada, a factor that may severely limit future Canadian biofuels research, and the development of technologies to address future carbon emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 52; Correspondence Address: R.E.

The topics on the reclamation of CO2 discussed in the review are as follows: (i) hydrogenation to methanol, dimethyl ether, methane, alkene, formic acid, etc. (ii) reaction with hydrocarbons, including CO2 reforming of methane to syngas; hydrocarbons oxidation to alkene, aldehyde, and carboxylic acid; C1-C3 hydrocarbons and aromatics carboxylation. (iii) reaction with oxy-organics, such as methanol, propylene glycol and epoxide, to obtain valuable chemicals and materials. (iv) Reaction of CO2 with others. In this review, the performance of the catalysts involved was evaluated, and the underlying reaction mechanisms of CO2 activation by catalysis were analyzed. In addition, opportunities and prospects in the other utilization of carbon dioxide were introduced, such as conversion of carbon dioxide to biodiesel and biogas by biological microalgae technologies, progress of CO2 utilization as new hydrogen storage materials. Carbon dioxide has good chemical stability, and the activation of CO2 is believed to be the key of the whole utilization process. It is necessary to develop suitable catalysts with high activity and selectivity in the further work. The exploitation of homogeneous catalyst may greatly enhance the conversion and selectivity of the reaction. Multi-functional catalysts with desirable adsorption-catalysis activity also need to be developed in order to directly use carbon dioxide emitted from different practical sources.

In an attempt to support algal biodiesel industry, the exploration of sustainability concerns involved in biodiesel refinery is becoming more and more necessary and important. From a sustainability perspective, this paper addresses the environmental, economic, social, and cultural implications of microalgae-based biodiesel refinery. From an environmental standpoint, there are four main related concerns: first, less water is required and water used can be recycled greatly, but it might cause water and even groundwater pollution; second, although low-value lands can be used for construction, it might cause land use changes and soil erosion; third, infrastructure construction and eutrophication by water pollution will threaten on local biodiversity; finally, there are some disputes of energy input and greenhouse gases emissions. From an economic point of view, the main benefit lies in an increase of employment and incomes, while the main drawback is the overwhelming investments required due to high costs. Socially, it can improve energy security and create jobs, while, on the other hand, it might affect the health of local animals and people. From a cultural viewpoint, algal biodiesel concept is a new element, and it requires time for people to adapt.

There are various instances of availability of bio-fuels which can substitute fossil fuels but they don't stand to be consumer friendly with respect of cost effectiveness.

Dunaliella is particularly advantageous as a feedstock because it is currently commercially mass cultured, thrives in salt water, and has no cell wall. Fourteen strains of Dunaliella have been investigated for growth rates and lipid production in mass culture and tested for enhanced lipid production under a range of environmental stressors including salinity, pH, nitrogen and phosphorus limitation, and light regime. The nuclear genome has been sequenced for four of these strains, with the objective of increasing carbon flux through genetic engineering. Electroflocculation followed by osmotic membrane rupturing may be a very energy and cost efficient means of harvesting the lipid bodies from Dunaliella. A technically feasible and scalable thermo-catalytic process to convert the lipids into replacements for liquid transportation fuels has been developed.

Main challenges are currently the feasibility of large-scale commercialization, since the majority of economic and financial analyses rely on pilot-scale projects. Environmental issues are most likely to diverge opinions from experts.

Biofuels are a potential alternative to fossil fuels. First- and second-generation biofuels face criticism due to food security and biodiversity issues. Third-generation biofuels, based on microalgae, seem to be a plausible solution to the current energy crisis, as their oil-producing capability is many times higher than that of various oil crops. Microalgae are the fastest-growing plants and can serve as a sustainable energy source for the production of biodiesel and several other biofuels by conversion of sunlight into chemical energy. Biofuels produced from microalgae are renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable and environment friendly. Microalgae can be grown in open pond systems or closed photobioreactors. Microalgal biofuels are a potential means to keep the development of human activities in synchronization with the environment. The integration of wastewater treatment with biofuel production using microalgae has made microalgal biofuels more attractive and cost effective. A biorefinery approach can also be used to improve the economics of biofuel production, in which all components of microalgal biomass (i.e., proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) are used to produce useful products. The integration of various processes for maximum economic and environmental benefits minimizes the amount of waste produced and the pollution level.

Microalgae have ability to fix atmospheric CO2 and convert it into sugars, which are then converted into fuel after biochemical processing. Microalgae have high growth rate and accumulate lipids up to 70% in their cell body. They demand less water and nutrients for their growth as compared to terrestrial crops. Despite these advantages, the scale-up applications of microalgae biofuels have some technical limitations.

Bioenergy is a promising alternative among the different renewable energy sources, and microalgae in particular are of interest because of their various desirable properties. Microalgae can yield a very high lipid content, which can be processed to biodiesel. They can capture carbon dioxide and can be grown even on degraded land with waste water. Additionally, it is possible to generate a variety of products such as ethanol, biogas and pharmaceuticals from microalgae. Inspite of these promising attributes, its commercial scale implementation has been limited. Here, the major challenge is the relatively high cost associated with the entire process. Additionally, each of the processing steps exhibits several technological challenges.

Because corn and soybean are staple food crops for humans, their common use as the main source of dietary energy and protein for food-producing animals directly competes with their allocation for human consumption. Alternatively, de-fatted marine microalgal biomass generated from the potential biofuel production may be a viable replacement of corn and soybean meal due to their high levels of protein, relatively well-balanced amino acid profiles, and rich contents of minerals and vitamins, along with unique bioactive compounds. Although the full-fatted (intact) microalgae represent the main source of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids including docohexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the de-fatted microalgal biomass may still contain good amounts of these components for enriching DHA/EPA in eggs, meats, and milk.

Microalgae have emerged as one of the most promising sources for biodiesel production. They are unicellular or colonial photosynthetic organisms, with permanently increasing role in industrial application in the production of not only chemicals and nutritional supplements, but also the biodiesel. The biodiesel productivity per hectare of cultivation area can be up to 100 times higher for microalgae than for oil crops. Also, microalgae can grow in a variety of environments that are often unsuitable for agricultural purposes. Microalgae oil content varies in different species and can reach up to 77% of dry biomass, while the oil productivity by the phototrophic cultivation of microalgae is up to 122 mg/l/d. Variations of the growth conditions and the implementation of the genetic engineering can induce the changes in the composition and productivity of microalgae oil. Biodiesel from microalgae can be produced in two ways: by transesterification of oil extracted from biomass or by direct transesterification of algal biomass (so called in situ transesterification). This paper reviews the curent status of microalgae used for the production of biodiesel including their isolation, cultivation, harvesting and conversion to biodiesel. Because of high oil productivity, microalgae will play a significant role in future biodiesel production. The advantages of using microalgae as a source for biofuel production are increased efficiency and reduced cost of production. Also, microalgae do not require a lot of space for growing and do not have a negative impact on the global food and water supplies. Disadvantages of using microalgae are more difficult separation of biomass and the need for further research to develop standardized methods for microalgae cultivation and biodiesel production. Currently, microalgae are not yet sustainable option for the commercial production of biodiesel. First of all, the price of biodiesel from microalgae is still higher than the price of diesel, due to high production costs.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: D. S.

Algal biofuels are being evolved as carbon (C)-neutral alternative biofuels. Algae are photosynthetic microorganisms that convert sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2) to various sugars and lipids Tri-Acyl-Glycols (TAG) and show promise as an alternative, renewable and green fuel source for India. Compared to land based oilseed crops algae have potentially higher yields (5-12 g/m2/d) and can use locations and water resources not suited for agriculture. Within India, there is little additional land area for algal cultivation and therefore needs to be carried out in places that are already used for agriculture, e. g. flooded paddy lands (20 Mha) with village level technologies and on saline wastelands (3 Mha). Cultivating algae under such conditions requires novel multi-tier, multi-cyclic approaches of sharing land area without causing threats to food and water security as well as demand for additional fertilizer resources by adopting multi-tier cropping (algae-paddy) in decentralized open pond systems. A large part of the algal biofuel production is possible in flooded paddy crop land before the crop reaches dense canopies, in wastewaters (40 billion litres per day), in salt affected lands and in nutrient/diversity impoverished shallow coastline fishery. Mitigation will be achieved through avoidance of GHG, C-capture options and substitution of fossil fuels. Estimates made in this paper suggest that nearly half of the current transportation petro-fuels could be produced at such locations without disruption of food security, water security or overall sustainability. This shift can also provide significant mitigation avenues. The major adaptation needs are related to socio-technical acceptance for reuse of various wastelands, wastewaters and waste-derived energy and by-products through policy and attitude change efforts. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 37; Correspondence Address: H.

In this context, the development of renewable, carbon-neutral and economically feasible biofuels is a driving force for innovation worldwide. A lot of effort has been put into developing biodiesel from microalgae. However, there are still a number of technological, market and policy barriers that are serious obstacles to the economic feasibility and competitiveness of such biofuels. Conversely, there are also a number of business opportunities if the production of such alternative biofuel becomes part of a larger integrated system following the Biorefinery strategy. In this case, other biofuels and chemical products of high added value are produced, contributing to an overall enhancement of the economic viability of the whole integrated system. Additionally, dual purpose microalgae-bacteria-based systems for treating wastewater and production of biofuels and chemical products significantly contribute to a substantial saving in the overall cost of microalgae biomass production. These types of systems could help to improve the competitiveness of biodiesel production from microalgae, according to some recent Life Cycle Analysis studies. Furthermore, they do not compete for fresh water resources for agricultural purposes and add value to treating the wastewater itself. This work reviews the most recent and relevant information about these types of dual purpose systems. Several aspects related to the treatment of municipal and animal wastewater with simultaneous recovery of microalgae with potential for biodiesel production are discussed. The use of pre-treated waste or anaerobic effluents from digested waste as nutrient additives for weak wastewater is reviewed. Isolation and screening of microalgae/cyanobacteria or their consortia from various wastewater streams, and studies related to population dynamics in mixed cultures, are highlighted as very relevant fields of research. The species selection may depend on various factors, such as the biomass and lipid productivity of each strain, the characteristics of the wastewater, the original habitat of the strain and the climatic conditions in the treatment plant, among others. Some alternative technologies aimed at harvesting biomass at a low cost, such as cell immobilization, biofilm formation, flocculation and bio-flocculation, are also reviewed. Finally, a Biorefinery design is presented that integrates the treatment of municipal wastewater with the recovery of oleaginous microalgae, together with the use of seawater supplemented with anaerobically digested piggery waste for cultivating Arthrospira (Spirulina) and producing biogas, biodiesel, hydrogen and other high added value products.

Pertinent questions however need to be answered on the commercial viability of large scale production of biodiesel from microalgae. Vital steps need to be critically analysed at each stage. Isolation of microalgae should be based on the question of whether marine or freshwater microalgae, cultures from collections or indigenous wild types are best suited for large scale production. Furthermore, the determination of initial sampling points play a pivotal role in the determination of strain selection as well as strain viability. The screening process should identify, purify and select lipid producing strains. Are natural strains or stressed strains higher in lipid productivity? The synergistic interactions that occur naturally between algae and other microorganisms cannot be ignored. A lot of literature is available on the downstream processing of microalgae but a few reports are available on the upstream processing of microalgae for biomass and lipid production for biodiesel production. We present in this review an empirical and critical analysis on the potential of translating research findings from laboratory scale trials to full scale application. The move from laboratory to large scale microalgal cultivation requires careful planning. It is imperative to do extensive pre-pilot demonstration trials and formulate a suitable trajectory for possible data extrapolation for large scale experimental designs. The pros and cons of the two widely used methods for growing microalgae by photobioreactors or open raceway ponds are discussed in detail. In addition, current methods for biomass harvesting and lipid extraction are critically evaluated. This would be novel approach to economical biodiesel production from microalgae in the near future.

The perceived benefits provide the underpinning rationale for much of the public support directed towards micro-algae research. Here we examine three aspects of micro-algae production that will ultimately determine the future economic viability and environmental sustainability: the energy and carbon balance, environmental impacts and production cost. This analysis combines systematic review and meta-analysis with insights gained from expert workshops. We find that achieving a positive energy balance will require technological advances and highly optimised production systems. Aspects that will need to be addressed in a viable commercial system include: energy required for pumping, the embodied energy required for construction, the embodied energy in fertilizer, and the energy required for drying and de-watering. The conceptual and often incomplete nature of algae production systems investigated within the existing literature, together with limited sources of primary data for process and scale-up assumptions, highlights future uncertainties around micro-algae biofuel production. Environmental impacts from water management, carbon dioxide handling, and nutrient supply could constrain system design and implementation options. Cost estimates need to be improved and this will require empirical data on the performance of systems designed specifically to produce biofuels. Significant (>50%) cost reductions may be achieved if CO2, nutrients and water can be obtained at low cost. This is a very demanding requirement, however, and it could dramatically restrict the number of production locations available. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 788; Correspondence Address: R.

High lipid productivity of dominant, fast-growing algae is a major prerequisite for commercial production of microalgal oil-derived biodiesel. However, under optimal growth conditions, large amounts of algal biomass are produced, but with relatively low lipid contents, while species with high lipid contents are typically slow growing. Major advances in this area can be made through the induction of lipid biosynthesis, e.g., by environmental stresses. Lipids, in the form of triacylglycerides typically provide a storage function in the cell that enables microalgae to endure adverse environmental conditions. Essentially algal biomass and triacylglycerides compete for photosynthetic assimilate and a reprogramming of physiological pathways is required to stimulate lipid biosynthesis. There has been a wide range of studies carried out to identify and develop efficient lipid induction techniques in microalgae such as nutrients stress (e.g., nitrogen and/or phosphorus starvation), osmotic stress, radiation, pH, temperature, heavy metals and other chemicals. In addition, several genetic strategies for increased triacylglycerides production and inducibility are currently being developed.

Currently, culturing of microalgae for CO2 bio-fixation has gained a huge momentum due to their high photosynthetic rate that allows bio-fixation of CO2 more efficient than terrestrial plants. In addition, lipid from microalgae biomass can be converted to biodiesel; a renewable fuel that emits less CO2 compared to fossil-diesel when combusted. However, several recent life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have revealed that enormous energy input is required to cultivate microalgae and also for the harvesting and drying processes. The energy required (in the form of electricity) is normally generated from burning coal or natural gas that emits substantial amount of CO2 to the atmosphere and this could entirely eliminate all the positive effect of culturing microalgae for CO2 bio-fixation and biofuel production. Thus, in this review, critical assessment and comparative study of CO2 bio-fixation rate by microalgae and CO2 emission rate during cultivation and processing of microalgae biodiesel were carried out.

Environmentally, four main concerns are mapped out: first, there are potential water safety risks, such as water resource abuse, water pollution and groundwater recharge deficiency; second, unreasonable construction will lead to land-use overexpansion, land pollution and service expectancy reduction; third, microalgae production may exert a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem, causing algal blooms and biological invasion; finally, microalgae might emit unexpected greenhouse gases [nitrogen oxides (NOx), methane (CH 4)] and ammonia (NH3). From an economic risk standpoint, microalgae production requires an overwhelming investment due to the expensive start-up and operation. Socially, contaminant discharge will threaten the health of local animals and people. Moreover, the safety effects of genetically modified algae may not be immediately apparent or known. In addition, over time, microalgae may become a medium for mosquitoes to spread disease. From a cultural point of view, it requires time for people in developing countries to adapt algal oil to their daily life as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, personnel changes in the workforce may harm existing cultural structures, and landscape aesthetics may be affected by system construction.

Their oil productivities are much higher than those of higher terrestrial plants, and they do not require high quality agricultural land. Microalgae may indeed be cultivated in brackish and wastewaters that provide suitable nutrients (e.g. NH4+,NO3-andPO43-), at the expense of only sunlight and atmospheric CO2. On the other hand, metabolic engineering permits release of molecular hydrogen also via photosynthetic routes, which will easily be converted to electricity in fuel cells or mechanical power in explosion engines, with only water vapor as exhaust product in both cases.However, large-scale implementation of microalga-based systems to manufacture biodiesel and biohydrogen has been economically constrained by their still poor volumetric efficiencies, which imply excessively high costs when compared with current petrofuel prices. Technological improvements are accordingly critical, both on the biocatalyst and the bioreactor levels. The current bottlenecks that have apparently precluded full industrial exploitation of microalgae cells are critically discussed here, viz. those derived from the scarce knowledge on the mechanisms that control regulation of gene expression, the reduced number of species subjected to successful genetic transformation, the relatively low cell density attainable, the poor efficiency in harvesting, and the difficulties in light capture and use.Therefore, this paper provides an overview of the feasibility of microalgae for production of biofuels via synthesis of liquid endocellular metabolites (i.e. triglycerides) and gaseous extracellular ones (i.e. molecular hydrogen), and addresses technical and economic shortcomings and opportunities along the whole processing chain, at both microorganism and reactor levels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 105; Correspondence Address: F.X.

The best option is bioenergy: the sun's energy is captured in biomass and converted to energy forms useful to modern society. To make a dent in global warming, bioenergy must be generated at a very high rate, since the world today uses ∼10 TW of fossil-fuel energy. And, it must do so without inflicting serious damage on the environment or disrupting our food supply. While most bioenergy options fail on both counts, several microorganism-based options have the potential to produce large amounts of renewable energy without disruptions. In one approach, microbial communities convert the energy value of various biomass residuals to socially useful energy. Biomass residuals come from agricultural, animal, and a variety of industrial operations, as well as from human wastes. Microorganisms can convert almost all of the energy in these wastes to methane, hydrogen, and electricity. In a second approach, photosynthetic microorganisms convert sunlight into biodiesel. Certain algae (eukaryotes) or cyanobacteria (prokaryotes) have high lipid contents. Under proper conditions, these photosynthetic microorganisms can produce lipids for biodiesel with yields per unit area 100 times or more than possible with any plant system. In addition, the non-lipid biomass can be converted to methane, hydrogen, or electricity. Photosynthetic microorganisms do not require arable land, an advantage because our arable land must be used to produce food.

A promising alternative is conveyed by microalgae, the oil content of which may exceed 80% (w/wDW) - as compared with 5% of the best agricultural oil crops. However, current implementation of microalga-based systems has been economically constrained by their still poor volumetric efficiencies - which lead to excessively high costs, as compared with petrofuel prices. Technological improvements of such processes are thus critical - and this will require a multiple approach, both on the biocatalyst and bioreactor levels. Several bottlenecks indeed exist at present that preclude the full industrial exploitation of microalgal cells: the number of species that have been subjected to successful genetic transformation is scarce, which hampers a global understanding (and thus a rational design) of novel blue-biotechnological processes; the mechanisms that control regulation of gene expression are not fully elucidated, as required before effective bioprocesses based on microalgae can be scaled-up; and new molecular biology tools are needed to standardize genetic modifications in microalgae - including efficient nuclear transformation, availability of promoter or selectable marker genes, and stable expression of transgenes. On the other hand, a number of pending technological issues are also present: the relatively low microalga intrinsic lipid productivity; the maximum cell concentration attainable; the efficiency of harvest and sequential recovery of bulk lipids; and the possibility of by-product upgrade. This review briefly covers the state of the art regarding microalgae toward production of biofuels, both from the point of view of the microalgal cell itself and of the supporting bioreactor; and discusses, in a critical manner, current limitations and promising perspectives in this field. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Export Date: 17 June 2025; Cited By: 485; Correspondence Address: F.X.

Specifically, large-scale microalgal culture need not compete for arable land, while in theory their productivity is greater. In consequence, there has been resurgence in interest and a proliferation of algae fuel projects. However, while on a theoretical basis, microalgae may produce between 10- and 100-fold more oil per acre, such capacities have not been validated on a commercial scale. We critically review current designs of algal culture facilities, including photobioreactors and open ponds, with regards to photosynthetic productivity and associated biomass and oil production and include an analysis of alternative approaches using models, balancing space needs, productivity and biomass concentrations, together with nutrient requirements. In the light of the current interest in synthetic genomics and genetic modifications, we also evaluate the options for potential metabolic engineering of the lipid biosynthesis pathways of microalgae. We conclude that although significant literature exists on microalgal growth and biochemistry, significantly more work needs to be undertaken to understand and potentially manipulate algal lipid metabolism. Furthermore, with regards to chemical upgrading of algal lipids and biomass, we describe alternative fuel synthesis routes, and discuss and evaluate the application of catalysts traditionally used for plant oils. Simulations that incorporate financial elements, along with fluid dynamics and algae growth models, are likely to be increasingly useful for predicting reactor design efficiency and life cycle analysis to determine the viability of the various options for largescale culture.

In the perspective of setting up massive cultures, the management of large quantities of residual biomass and the high amounts of fertilizers must be considered. Anaerobic digestion is a key process that can solve this waste issue as well as the economical and energetic balance of such a promising technology. Indeed, the conversion of algal biomass after lipid extraction into methane is a process that can recover more energy than the energy from the cell lipids. Three main bottlenecks are identified to digest microalgae. First, the biodegradability of microalgae can be low depending on both the biochemical composition and the nature of the cell wall. Then, the high cellular protein content results in ammonia release which can lead to potential toxicity. Finally, the presence of sodium for marine species can also affect the digester performance. Physico-chemical pretreatment, co-digestion, or control of gross composition are strategies that can significantly and efficiently increase the conversion yield of the algal organic matter into methane. When the cell lipid content does not exceed 40%, anaerobic digestion of the whole biomass appears to be the optimal strategy on an energy balance basis, for the energetic recovery of cell biomass.

Algal biofuels would be based mainly on the high lipid content of the algal cell and thus would be an ideal feedstock for high energy density transportation fuels, such as biodiesel as well as green diesel, green jet fuel and green gasoline. A comprehensive research and development program for the development of algal biofuels was initiated by the US Department of Energy (DoE) more than 30 years ago, and although great progress was made, the program was discontinued in 1996, because of decreasing federal budgets and low petroleum costs. Interest in algal biofuels has been growing recently due to increased concern over peak oil, energy security, greenhouse gas emissions, and the potential for other biofuel feedstocks to compete for limited agricultural resources. The high productivity of algae suggests that much of the US transportation fuel needs can be met by algal biofuels at a production cost competitive with the cost of petroleum seen during the early part of 2008. Development of algal biomass production technology, however, remains in its infancy.

These products can be processed into both biofuels and useful chemicals. Two algae samples (Cladophora fracta and Chlorella protothecoid) were studied for biofuel production. Microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels. Microalgae can be converted to biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-oil, biohydrogen and biomethane via thermochemical and biochemical methods. Industrial reactors for algal culture are open ponds, photobioreactors and closed systems. Algae can be grown almost anywhere, even on sewage or salt water, and does not require fertile land or food crops, and processing requires less energy than the algae provides. Microalgae have much faster growth-rates than terrestrial crops. the per unit area yield of oil from algae is estimated to be from 20,000 to 80,000liters per acre, per year; this is 7-31 times greater than the next best crop, palm oil. Algal oil can be used to make biodiesel for cars, trucks, and airplanes. The lipid and fatty acid contents of microalgae vary in accordance with culture conditions. The effect of temperature on the yield of hydrogen from two algae (C. fracta and C. protothecoid) by pyrolysis and steam gasification were investigated in this study. In each run, the main components of the gas phase were CO2, CO, H2, and CH4.The yields of hydrogen by pyrolysis and steam gasification processes of the samples increased with temperature. The yields of gaseous products from the samples of C. fracta and C. protothecoides increased from 8.2% to 39.2% and 9.5% to 40.6% by volume, respectively, while the final pyrolysis temperature was increased from 575 to 925K. The percent of hydrogen in gaseous products from the samples of C. fracta and C. protothecoides increased from 25.8% to 44.4% and 27.6% to 48.7% by volume, respectively, while the final pyrolysis temperature was increased from 650 to 925K.
