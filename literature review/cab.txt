AB Third generation micro algae feedstock cultivation and fuel production
   have sustainable and economic benefits due to their microscopic nature.
   Each process in the production of micro algae biodiesel such as
   cultivation, harvesting and extraction can be optimized to negate the
   factors affecting production. Optimized micro algae biodiesel blends can
   be utilized to obtain ideal engine maps by calibrating engine parameters
   at stationary or dynamic engine tests. Numerous studies are available on
   micro algae based biodiesel production and its application in IC
   engines. Even though few consolidated articles are available on the
   effects of using micro algae biodiesel in IC engines, little to no
   article is available clubbing the production and optimization aspects of
   micro algae biodiesel with engine testing. To address this issue, this
   article intends to consolidate studies which have utilized different
   reactors for cultivating diverse micro algae species with multiple
   growth mediums. Furthermore, this combination also includes different
   biomass preprocessing and extraction techniques in producing micro algae
   biodiesel. Also, the implementation of micro algae biodiesel in IC
   engines and its output characteristics for different micro algae
   biodiesels have been highlighted and analyzed. To understand the current
   commercial status of micro algae biodiesel, a techno-economic analysis
   has been drawn. Studies revealed that closed type reactors are effective
   for continuous cultivation due to the constant regulation and
   availability of optimized growth factors. Furthermore, the
   techno-economic assessment revealed that the maintenance costs involved
   in the production should be lowered by 2-3 times the original to make
   micro algae biodiesel commercially available.

AB The global concerns of increasing atmospheric concentration of green
   house gas emissions and world energy demand has led to the substantial
   interest in developing sustainable energy sources. The greenhouse gas
   most commonly produced by burning fossil fuels is carbon dioxide (CO2),
   which is responsible for 63% of global warming. Micro algae are viewed
   as sustainable approach for Carbon fixation. Microalgae are capable of
   fixing CO2using sunlight to produce biofuel and other chemical compounds
   with numerous additional technological advantages. This present study
   highlights the concept of algal carbon sequestration and biofuel
   production using open raceway ponds and closed photo bioreactor. This
   article addresses its technical and economic aspects.

AB In this study the LCA methodology is applied in order to satisfy two

   of biodiesel from terrestrial and micro-algae feedstock; (ii) to compare
   quantitatively, utilizing primary data, the impacts of the first
   generation in respect to the third generation bio-fuels. Results show
   that micro-algae are neither competitive yet with traditional oil crops
   nor with fossil fuel. The use of renewable technologies as photovoltaics
   and biogas self production might increase the competitiveness of
   micro-algae oil. Further investigations are however necessary to
   optimize their production chain and to increase the added value of

AB Many researchers consider efficient harvesting is the major challenge of
   commercialising micro-algal biofuel. Although micro-algal biomass can be
   'energy rich', the growth of algae in dilute suspension at around
   0.02-0.05% dry solids poses considerable challenges in achieving a
   viable energy balance in micro-algal biofuel process operations.
   Additional challenges of micro-algae harvesting come from the small size
   of micro-algal cells, the similarity of density of the algal cells to
   the growth medium, the negative surface charge on the algae and the
   algal growth rates which require frequent harvesting compared to
   terrestrial plants. Algae can be harvested by a number of methods;
   sedimentation, flocculation, flotation, centrifugation and filtration or
   a combination of any of these. This paper reviews the various methods of
   harvesting and dewatering micro-algae for the production of biofuel.
   There appears to be no one method or combination of harvesting methods
   suited to all micro-algae and harvesting method will have a considerable
   influence on the design and operation of both upstream and downstream
   processes in an overall micro-algal biofuel production process.

AB Micro-algae have received considerable interest as a potential feedstock
   for producing sustainable transport fuels (biofuels). The perceived
   benefits provide the underpinning rationale for much of the public
   support directed towards micro-algae research. Here we examine three
   aspects of micro-algae production that will ultimately determine the
   future economic viability and environmental sustainability: theenergy
   and carbon balance,environmental impactsandproduction cost. This
   analysis combines systematic review and meta-analysis with insights
   gained from expert workshops. We find that achieving a positive energy
   balance will require technological advances and highly optimised
   production systems. Aspects that will need to be addressed in a viable
   commercial system include: energy required for pumping, the embodied
   energy required for construction, the embodied energy in fertilizer, and
   the energy required for drying and de-watering. The conceptual and often
   incomplete nature of algae production systems investigated within the
   existing literature, together with limited sources of primary data for
   process and scale-up assumptions, highlights future uncertainties around
   micro-algae biofuel production. Environmental impacts from water
   management, carbon dioxide handling, and nutrient supply could constrain
   system design and implementation options. Cost estimates need to be
   improved and this will require empirical data on the performance of
   systems designed specifically to produce biofuels. Significant (>50%)
   cost reductions may be achieved if CO2, nutrients and water can be
   obtained at low cost. This is a very demanding requirement, however, and
   it could dramatically restrict the number of production locations
   available.

AB Micro-algae are photosynthetic organisms, which represent a promissory
   renewable raw material for biofuels production, since they can be
   cultivated in non-fertile lands, avoiding the competition with food
   crops for land use. From micro-algae, oil can be obtained oil that can
   be converted to biodiesel, green diesel and biojet fuel. In particular,
   the renewable aviation fuel is one of the less explored biofuels;
   nevertheless, for the aviation sector, this is the best alternative to
   reduce CO2emissions, allowing its sustainable development. In order to
   produce hydrocarbons in the boiling point range of jet fuel, we need to
   transform the micro-algae oil. A number of research projects report the
   use of micro-algae oil for the production of biojet fuel through the
   hydrotreating process. However, the application of process
   intensification strategies for the hydroprocessing of micro-algae oil
   has not been reported. Therefore, in this work we propose the modeling,
   simulation and intensification of the hydrotreating process to produce
   biojet fuel, considering micro-algae oil as raw material. The
   hydroprocessing of micro-algae oil is modeled in Aspen Plus processes
   simulator, based on data from an experimental study recently reported.
   The produced renewable hydrocarbons are purified through conventional
   and intensified distillation sequences; thereby, conventional and
   intensified hydrotreating processes are defined and evaluated in terms
   of total annual costs, CO2emissions and biojet fuel price. Simulation
   results show that the implementation of intensification strategies leads
   to the production of biojet fuel with reduced carbon dioxide emissions,
   34% less, and a competitive price per liter, 78% cheaper than fossil jet
   fuel price.

AB Micro algae are promising attractive energy carriers. Their biomass
   productivity is 5-30 times higher than that of first and second
   generation biomass. Additionally, they utilize CO2 for their
   photosynthetic process thereby protects possibly the environment and
   contributes towards CO2 remediation at higher rates. Their cultivation
   can be combined with wastewater and industrial effluents which
   consequently leads to the bioremediation of inorganic elements more
   effectively. Among the conversion technologies for the biofuel
   production from the micro algal biomass, thermochemical conversion is an
   enduring sustainable alternative path in the view of engineering as this
   process utilizes all kinds of the biochemical moieties from the micro
   algal biomass cellular constitution. This article reviews the bio
   moieties of micro algal biomass, and subsequent use of them in
   thermochemical liquefaction (TCL) technologies like pyrolysis and
   hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) for the extraction of liquid fuels and
   upgrading of bio-oil processes via decarbonylation, decarboxylation
   (DCO) and hydrogenation for palmitic/oleic using suitable catalysts viz
   activated carbon with noble metals & cost-effective tungsten based
   catalysts. These two technically feasible processes in an appropriate
   technical downstream path are dependent on the oil upgrading process.
   Moreover, a comparative study of pyrolysis and HTL processes has been
   evaluated towards the challenges and opportunities of a commercial-scale
   microalgae-to-fuels process in the consideration for mitigating
   technical, environmental, and logistical concern.

AB The review highlights the correlation between removal of various
   eco-toxins by micro algae and the production of high-value products
   thereof. It appraises established and novel strategies for micro algal
   cultivation, downstream processing methods for product recovery, and
   recent progress in algal generation of the green energy carriers biogas
   and biohydrogen micro algae. The suitability of selected micro algal
   species for various final products, and the potential of different
   strains for abating environmental problems are discussed. Due to the
   fact that low cell densities and moderate growth rates are known as the
   major obstacles towards a broad market penetration of micro algal
   products, the article shows how high cell densities and reasonable
   volumetric productivities can be obtained. Here, the article deals with
   the improvements of process design and nutrient supply regimes that are
   needed to achieve these goals. As demonstrated by an integrated case
   study, mixotrophic cultivation results in increased biomass
   concentration in a first cultivation step for some micro algal strains
   likeNannochloropsis oculata. In a second step, the fresh active algal
   biomass accumulates desired productsviaCO2fixation, e.g. from industrial
   effluent gases, as the sole carbon source. This can be realized by a
   novel, two-stage, continuously operated closed photo-bioreactor system.
   After cell harvest and optimized product recovery, the value-added
   conversion of residual algal biomass for generation of green energy
   carriers, e.g. in biogas plants, constitutes another focal point of the
   ongoing research.

AB The rapid growth of human population has led to mounting energy demands,
   which is projected to increase by 50% or more by 2030. The natural
   petroleum can not catch-up the current consumption rate, which is
   already reported to be 105 times faster than nature can create. Besides,
   the use of fossil fuels is devastating to our environment through
   greenhouse gas emissions and consequent global warming. Therefore, the
   search for 'clean' energy has become the most overwhelming challenges.
   Currently, several alternatives are being studied and implemented.
   Biofuels, fuels from living organisms, provide environmental benefits,
   since their use leads to a decrease in the harmful emissions of CO2 and
   hydrocarbons and, to the elimination of SOx emissions, with a consequent
   decrease in the greenhouse effects. Unfortunately, the present biofuel
   projections are based on feed-stocks that are also food commodities and
   resources suitable for conventional agriculture. One possibility to
   overcome the problem is the cultivation of micro-algae and switching to
   third generation biofuels, which seem to be a promising source since
   algae are able to efficiently convert sunlight, water, and CO2 into a
   variety of products suitable for renewable energy applications.
   Therefore, this review is intended to recapitulate current works on
   micro-algal biofuel production potential and discuss possible ways to
   put it into practice. This review starts by highlighting the advantages
   and various forms of micro-algal biofuels. Some of the micro-algal
   species proved to be suitable for biofuel production so far are
   considered, with particular emphasis on Scenedesmus obliquus. The recent
   attempts and achievements in improving the economies of production
   through genetic and metabolic engineering of micro-algal strains are
   also addressed. Other potential applications such as wastewater
   treatment and CO2 mitigation that can be coupled with biofuel production
   are described. Finally, the promises and challenges of algae to biofuel
   industry are uncovered.

AB The demand for energy is ever increasing, and concurrently the depletion
   of fossil fuels has been so rapid that it could lead to an energy crisis
   in the near future. At the same time, reducing the carbon footprint to
   mitigate global warming has been a subject of immediate attention.
   Production of energy through photosynthetic organisms such as
   micro-algae by harnessing solar energy might be a viable solution to
   some of these issues. In pursuit of renewable energy sources, efforts
   worldwide focus on identifying those organisms that can accumulate high
   quantities of biomass and produce molecules that can be converted to
   combustible materials. Economically viable processes for large-scale
   cultivation and downstream processing of biofuel precursors, such as
   lipids and hydrocarbons, have been a challenge, requiring adoption of
   technologies needing reduced inputs of energy and chemicals. Prudent
   energy audits to assess the viability of bio-energy processes are a
   necessity. The utilization of micro-algae for bio-energy production
   would be viable only when the whole process has a net energy gain, with
   complete utilization of algal biomass for biofuel and the co-products
   thereof used to produce food, feed and chemicals. The spent algal
   biomass - which is rich in proteins, carbohydrates, minerals and
   bio-active compounds - is ideal for feed applications. The paper
   outlines biorefinery approaches to integrated utilization of algal
   biomass for bio-energy, with co-production of valuable metabolites and
   nutrients as feed, with full utilization of all the fractions for
   economic viability of the process. These aspects are dealt with in
   detail in the various sections to provide a comprehensive overview of
   micro-algal technology for biofuel programmesvis-a-visfeed applications.

AB Micro-algae constitute powerful unicellular factories with enormous
   potential for mitigation of miscellaneous pollutants from effluent gases
   and waste waters. Especially their outstanding capacity for
   photosynthetic CO2 fixation underlines their potential for diminishing
   current ecological problems. Together with these contributions to
   beneficial environmental development, various micro-algae accumulate
   high-value marketable products as cell constituents. Low cell densities
   and moderate growth rates typical for algal cultivation are known as the
   major obstacles in industrial manufacturing of algal products: Here,
   high cell densities are required to obtain reasonable volumetric
   productivities. This raises the challenges for the process engineering
   design and novel nutrient supply regimes as needed for efficient algal
   cultivation. For some algal strains, mixotrophic cultivation by
   providing organic substrates together with CO2 results in increased
   biomass concentration in a first cultivation step. For this purpose,
   numerous organic waste streams can be applied as substrate. In a second
   step, active algal biomass accumulates desired products via CO2
   fixation, e.g. from industrial effluent gases. This can be realized by
   two-stage, continuously operated photo-bioreactor systems. After
   optimized product recovery, the value-added conversion of residual algal
   biomass for energy recovery e.g. in biogas plants, constitutes another
   challenge.

AB The phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity of micro-algae capable of
   accumulating triacylglycerols provides a challenge for the accurate
   determination of biotechnological potential. High-yielding strains are
   needed to improve economic viability and their compositional information
   is required for optimizing biodiesel properties. To facilitate a
   high-throughput screening programme, a very rapid direct-derivatization
   procedure capable of extracting lyophilized material for GC analysis was
   compared with a scaled-down Folch-based method. This was carried out on
   ten micro-algal strains from 6 phyla where the more rapid
   direct-derivatization approach was found to provide a more reliable
   measure of yield. The modified Folch-based procedure was found to
   substantially underestimate oil yield in oneChlorellaspecies (P<0.01).
   In terms of fatty acid composition however, the Folch procedure proved
   to be slightly better in recovering polyunsaturated fatty acids, in six
   out of the ten strains. Therefore, direct-derivatization is recommended
   for rapid determination of yields in screening approaches but can
   provide slightly less compositional accuracy than solvent-based
   extraction methods.

AB It is expected that the need for protein sources for application in feed
   will increase drastically in the coming decades. This paper addresses
   the background of this increased protein demand, and the perspectives of
   some novel plant proteins for poultry feed. In particular the protein
   providing or replacing properties of macro algae (seaweeds), micro
   algae, leaf proteins and free amino acids will be discussed. The
   chemical composition of seaweeds shows large variation due to among
   others species, location, and harvesting season, which provides both
   opportunities and challenges. The high mineral content and potentially
   high heavy metal content requires attention. There is limited and
   inconsistent information regarding the nutritive value of seaweeds for
   poultry. Some intact seaweeds showed prebiotic effects or reduced the
   bacterial load in case of a bacterial challenge. Recentin vitrostudies
   with extracted seaweed polysaccharides demonstrated anti-bacterial
   effects, as well as stimulating effects on the immune system, energy
   metabolism and oxidative response. These seaweed properties seem to be
   very promising, butin vivopoultry studies should be conducted to
   validate these findings. Based on results available from literature it
   can be concluded that micro algae from a nutritional point of view can
   be considered as a useful protein source in laying hen and broiler
   diets. Inclusion levels between 5 and 15% seem to be applicable without
   negative effects on bird performance. The effects of cell wall
   disruption techniques on nutrient digestibility need further
   investigation. Moreover, there are several indications that micro algae
   contain bioactive components, which might contribute to an improvement
   of the quality of meat and eggs and to bird health. Besides, micro algae
   potentially have a very high protein yield per hectare, making algae a
   promising novel protein source. Intact grass might to some extent
   contribute to the protein supply of poultry. The fibre content of intact
   grass, however, limits its use in poultry diets. Biorefinery might
   increase the possibilities to use grass and other leaves by separating
   the protein and fibre fractions. In vivo studies are required to
   demonstrate the nutritional value of extracted leaf proteins in poultry.
   Supplementation of free amino acids to the diet allows a substantial
   reduction of the soybean meal content of broiler diets, thereby reducing
   the crude protein content, without adverse effects on growth performance
   and slaughter yield, provided that diets are supplemented with
   sufficient lysine, and free methionine, threonine, arginine, isoleucine,
   valine and glycine in the recommended ratio to lysine. Based on the
   current nutritional knowledge we conclude that micro algae and free
   amino acids currently already can substantially contribute to poultry
   diets as novel proteins or protein replacers, whereas the protein value
   of seaweeds and leaf proteins for poultry needs further investigation.

AB The growing demand for fuels combined with the fact that there are
   limited fossil fuel resources has led the world to seek renewable energy
   resources such as biofuels. Micro-algae can be an efficient source of
   biofuel energy, since it significantly reduces air pollution. In this
   paper, we develop a micro-algae biofuel supply chain through a two-stage
   approach. This study aims to commercialize micro-algae as a new source
   of energy. In the first stage, we utilize the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to
   determine the best cultivation system, and in the second stage, a
   bi-objective mathematical model is presented which simultaneously
   optimizes the economic and environmental objectives. We also propose a
   robust optimization model to deal with the uncertain nature of the
   biofuel supply chain. Our analysis on the trade-off between the supply
   chain's total cost and unfulfillment demand arrives at interesting
   managerial insights. Furthermore, to show the effectiveness of the
   robust optimization model, we compare the performance of the robust and
   deterministic models, and the results show that the robust model
   dominates over the deterministic model in all scenarios. Finally,
   sensitivity analysis on critical parameters is conducted to help
   decision-makers find the optimal trade-off between investment and its
   benefits.

AB Global warming is caused mainly by the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2),
   with thermal power plants being responsible for about 7 per cent of
   global CO2 emissions. The Use of fossil fuels to meet our energy
   requirement has resulted in adverse effects on the climate, over
   dependence on foreign oil and economic uncertainties. The increase in
   the surface temperature due to global warming, causing catastrophic
   effects, compels the scientist community to tag it as an issue of prior
   concern. The most of the environmental group urging for individual,
   group or community actions against global warming, through switching to
   alternate energy to hinder the speed of warming up. These methodologies
   remain virtual. To mitigate these harmful effects, biological
   alternatives to capture CO2 are being investigated. The use of carbon
   sequestration by micro algae is a major tool for reducing atmospheric
   concentrations of CO2. This paper highlights the photosynthetic way of
   fixing CO2 from flue gas and the various technical and economic
   challenges involved in it. Current research issues such as design of
   algae pond and photo bioreactor, algae strain selection, operational
   problems and harvesting techniques are described.

AB Future micro-algal biofuels will most likely be derived from open-pond
   production systems. These are by definition open to "invasion" by
   grazers, which could devastate micro-algal mass-cultures. There is an
   urgent requirement for methodologies capable of early detection and
   control of grazers in dense algal cultures. In this study a model system
   employing the marine alga Nannochloropsis oculata was challenged by
   grazers including ciliates, amoebae and a heterotrophic dinoflagellate.
   A FlowCAM flow-cytometer was used to detect all grazers investigated
   (size range <20->80 m in length) in the presence of algae. Detection
   limits were <10 cells ml-1 for both "large" and "small" model grazers,
   Euplotes vannus (80*45 m) and an unidentified holotrichous ciliate (18*8
   m) respectively. Furthermore, the system can distinguish the presence of
   ciliates in N. oculata cultures with biotechnologically relevant cell
   densities; i.e. >1.4*108 cells ml-1 (>0.5 g l-1 dry wt.).

AB It is well established that the drinking water treatment has several
   disadvantages such as it may rupture the algae, thereby releasing the
   taste- and odour-producing oils before the whole algae are removed from
   the treatment system. This review aims to present the concept of algae
   recovery instead of its removal in drinking water treatment plant.
   Control of algae in water supplies and some coagulation/flocculation and
   electrolysis experiments as harvesting methods are discussed. In fact,
   algae recovery instead of its removal in water treatment plant is a
   promising perspective and a suitable issue when the surface water comes
   from dams where algae blooms occur frequently. Micro-algae are a
   sustainable energy resource with great potential for CO2 fixation. The
   micro-algae could be grown in photo-bioreactors or in open ponds. A new
   interesting field of research would be fast and simultaneous algal
   biodiesel production with drinking water treatment in the biodiesel
   production/water treatment plant without chemicals. However, the fact
   that algal cultivation needs light and space would be very difficult
   challenge.

AB A life-cycle analysis (LCA) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy
   use was performed to study bio-jet fuel (BJF) production from
   micro-algae grown in open ponds under Chinese conditions using the
   Tsinghua University LCA Model (TLCAM). Attention was paid to energy
   recovery through biogas production and cogeneration of heat and power
   (CHP) from the residual biomass after oil extraction, including fugitive
   methane (CH4) emissions during the production of biogas and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) emissions during the use of digestate (solid residue from
   anaerobic digestion) as agricultural fertilizer. Analyses were performed
   based on examination of process parameters, mass balance conditions,
   material requirement, energy consumptions and the realities of energy
   supply and transport in China (i.e., electricity generation and heat
   supply primarily based on coal, multiple transport modes). Our LCA
   result of the BJF pathway showed that, compared with the traditional
   petrochemical pathway, this new pathway will increase the overall fossil
   energy use and carbon emission by 39% and 70%, respectively, while
   decrease petroleum consumption by about 84%, based on the same units of
   energy service. Moreover, the energy conservation and emission reduction
   benefit of this new pathway may be accomplished by two sets of
   approaches: wider adoption of low-carbon process fuels and optimization
   of algae cultivation and harvest, and oil extraction processes.

AB Eco-friendly bio-diesel production using the growth of microalgae has
   recently been investigated in response to fossil fuel depletion and
   environmental concerns. Photobioreactors (PBRs) using microalgae,
   however, have a limitation in that the light transmittance rate is
   reduced as the algae become adsorbed on the surfaces of the reactor. The
   purpose of this study was to seek improvements in light transmittance in
   PBRs and to assess antimicrobial activity in the delivery system by
   analyzing adsorption characteristics of microalgae towards delivery
   system components used in PBRs and general reactors, using various
   surface modifications. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), a polymer, and
   stainless steel 316L were used as experimental specimens. The surface of
   the PMMA was treated with plasma and fluorocarbon resin. The surface of
   the stainless steel 316L was treated with a pulse electrochemical
   polishing (PECP) process to make the surface smooth and to enhance
   corrosion resistance as well as cleaning. For measurements of surface
   changes after these modifications, we performed three-dimensional (3D)
   configuration analysis, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), and
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic analyses, with a contact angle meter. The
   specimens were submerged in microalgae cultures after undergoing the
   various surface treatments, and the microalgae were continuously
   circulated to simulate the conditions in PBRs. The adsorption
   characteristics of micro algae toward to surface-modified PMMA and
   stainless steel 316L were also analyzed.

AB Different kinds of technologies are now adopted to treat the industrial
   and agricultural waste waters by chemical, physical and biological
   means. Research on microalgae as a probable solution for the wastewater
   treatment has gained importance in the recent years since; the
   microalgae have the potential to utilize inexpensive substrates in the
   wastewater for their growth and sustenance. Moreover, the ability of
   microalgae to treat wastewater and produce biofuels makes it an
   economically viable and environmental friendly feedstock. The present
   review deals with the treatment of wastewaters using micro algal
   cultivation systems such as open and closed systems and the relative
   effectiveness of the various strategies of harvesting micro algal like
   filtration, sedimentation and centrifugation are addressed. Currently,
   there are various approaches used by industries and companies taking
   pure water from laboratory to pilot scale; nevertheless, large scale
   production systems for controlled microalgae cultivation and biomass
   harvesting for wastewater treatment application and subsequent
   processing for biofuels production are lacking. Searching methods on
   large scale algae cultivation and harvesting for biofuels production are
   necessary for further development. The viability of each application is
   evaluated on the basis of its algae cultivation nutrient removal
   efficiency, biomass harvesting, economic feasibility and future
   perspectives are also discussed in this review.

AB Micro-algae have been recognized as a promising feedstock for biofuel
   production. Effective combining microalgae cultivation with wastewater
   treatment can reduce CO2 emissions and the cost of microalgae biofuel
   production, making it more feasible. However, the biomass and lipid
   productivity must be improved prior to large-scale production. The paper
   is therefore giving a critical review on microalgae productivity towards
   biofuel production focusing on the influencing factors in terms of
   strains and cultivation condition. Based on this review, we recommend
   the mixed native algae species and employment of two-stage cultivation
   strategy as potential breakthrough toward sustainable and economic
   microalgae biofuel production using wastewater as a medium for
   cultivation.

AB Biodiesel has received much attention in recent years. The motivation
   for renewable fuel is not just energy independence but also mitigation
   of global climate disruption, which has been called "the deficiency
   challenge of our era" Energy, is essential and vital for development,
   and the global economy literally runs on energy. Although numerous
   reports are available on the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils
   of terrestrial oil-plants, such as soybean, sunflower and palm oils the
   use of fossil fuels as energy now widely accepted as unsustainable due
   to depleting resources and also due to the accumulation of green house
   gases in the environment. Biodiesel demand is constantly increasing as
   the reservoir of fossil fuel are depleting. Unfortunately biodiesel
   production from oil crop, waste cooking oil and animal fats are not able
   to replace fossil fuel. The viability of the first generation biofuel
   production is however questionable because of the conflict with food
   supply. The manuscript is an attempt to review the potential of
   microalgae in lipid production and provides a brief summary of genes
   which enhances the lipid synthesis and biomass productivity of different
   species of micro algae.

AB The production of solid and liquid bio-fuels in the EU is increasing and
   is governed by various legislative measures. The aim is to provide 20%
   of EU consumption from renewable sources by 2020. In addition to
   designated crops, the grassland biomass, basically plant material from
   uncultivated land, involving CO2 capture, is a potential key to
   sustainable bio-energy production. Bio-diesel is produced in Italy
   chiefly by 4 firms; a new process to produce it from micro-algae
   (Botryococcus braunii) offers interesting prospects. For bio-ethanol, an
   agreement has been reached between the main agricultural organizations
   and the distillers (Assodistilla) to produce half the quota of 79 000 t
   from wine making and the rest from beet and maize. It is anticipated
   that the EU will devote 8 million ha to bio-fuel crops to meet growing
   demand.

AB In present times, non-renewable energy resources are dwindling at a
   faster rate. It has, therefore, become very essential to develop new
   alternative sources of energy to overcome this problem. The use of
   microalgae and its biomass as a starting material has received much
   interest in recent years because of its eco-friendly nature,
   biodegradability and lower net carbon cycle and these features are in
   sharp contrast with those of conventional petroleum fuels. Microalgae
   are photosynthetic organisms which accumulate chemical energy during
   their vegetative propagation. Utilizing these microalgae as a feedstock
   to produce renewable fuel is an emerging trend. The present work starts
   with a discussion on the different culturing techniques followed by an
   in-depth evaluation of the various processes that use microalgae and its
   biomass for biofuel production. This review also gives a glance of the
   current scenario and the merits and demerits of every process. The
   entire process of developing biofuel from algal mass is being carried
   out at research level. More works are yet to be conducted to overcome
   the difficulties in implementing the process of full-fledged
   exploitation of micro-algae for biofuel production at industry level.

AB Algae have been used as food and as sources of a wide range of chemicals
   for thousands of years. Over the last 50 years, the major products from
   algae have been the phycocolloids, namely agar and carrageenans; many
   macroalgal species, as well as being used as human food, have been an
   important source of folk medicines and are now being examined as
   potential sources of new drugs. Details are given of the algal products
   currently being commercialized, which include carotenoids, phycobilins,
   fatty acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, sterols, and biologically active
   molecules for use in human and animal health. Specific requirements for
   research and development for particular products are outlined. It is
   concluded that despite such limitations, the use of microalgae as
   sources of valuable chemicals is established and the next few years
   should see a continued expansion of the range of commercially available
   microalgal products.

AB The anaerobic digestion, AD, process presents a solution for sustainable
   waste management, greenhouse gas mitigation and energy production for
   growing population needs and requirements. Adopting a biorefinery
   approach that utilises different feedstock may enhance energy production
   and support optimisation of the anaerobic digestion process. Algae is a
   promising feedstock that could be used for energy production via the
   anaerobic digestion process. Microalgal biomass is rich in carbohydrates
   and lipids; however, many species of algae exhibit tough cell walls that
   could also be difficult to digest and may influence or inhibit the
   efficiency of the AD process. This study concentrated on the comparison
   of AD remediation of two marine algal biomass species,Tetraselmis
   suecicaandNannochloropsis oceanica. The two species were pre-treated
   with an ultrasound technique and compared for their methane production
   using biochemical methane potential tests. ForTetraselmis, a specific
   methane production of 0.165 LCH4/KgVS was observed; however,
   forNannochloropsis, a value of 0.101 LCH4/KgVS was observed for the
   samples treated with ultrasound. The BMP results from this study show
   that among the two micro-algae species tested,Tetraselmis suecicais
   found to be a better substrate for methane production potential.
   Contrary to increasing the specific methane production, ultrasound
   cavitation caused a slight decrease in the specific methane production
   values for bothNannochloropsis oceanicaandTetraselmis suecicabiomass
   residues. The pre-treatment of the biomass using ultrasound techniques
   provided comparable results and can be recommended for effective
   bioenergy production. However, further research is required for the
   optimisation of the pre-treatment of microalgae and for the integration
   of microalgal biorefineries for circular economy.

AB Phyco-remediation is an environmental-friendly method, which involves
   the application of beneficial microalgae to treat wastewater-containing
   pollutants for a diverse range of conditions. Several industrial
   processes generate hyper saline wastewater, which is a significant
   challenge for conventional wastewater treatment, and the disposal of
   saline waters also has a negative impact on the environment. Road salt
   run-off is one such saline wastewater stream not currently treated and
   one that contributes significantly to negatively impacting receiving
   bodies of water. In this study, Nannochloropsis microalgae were able to
   assimilate >95% of the nitrates within 8 days in road salt
   concentrations ranging from 2.6% to 4.4% under phototrophic cultivation
   mode. Biomass yields of 1-2 g/l of culture were obtained with the
   maximum lipid of 22% (g/g) biomass in the road salt media. The crude
   road salt media provided all the essential micronutrients needed for
   algal cultivation. The fatty acid composition analysis of the obtained
   lipid composed of C16 and C18 over 45% of FAME are suitable for biofuel.
   This study has established that the use of road salt containing nitrate
   and phosphate nutrients will support the growth of marine micro algae
   for remediation of a waste water system that are the concern at
   winter-prevalent regions.

AB Injection parameter such as fuel opening injection pressure has a
   significant impact on engine combustion, performance, and emissions. For
   each loading condition of 30%, 60%, 80%, 90%, and 100%, respectively,
   micro algal biodiesel blends of 30% (MA30H2) were used, along with
   injection parameters and a fixed hydrogen flow rate of 7 lpm. The goal
   of this endeavor is to make single-cylinder diesel engines more
   efficient and less polluting. There are also two great substitutes for
   traditional fuels that can reduce energy usage and abide by strict
   emission regulations: hydrogen and biodiesel. A total of three different
   opening injection pressures 220, 240, and 260 bar will be used in the
   experiment. Due to its high calorific value, hydrogen enrichment
   enhances BTE and BSFC and reduces emissions like HC, CO, and CO2.
   However, due to a rise in EGT, NOx emission has increased. With the
   addition of hydrogen, combustion properties such as in-cylinder pressure
   (ICP), heat release rate (HRR), and ignition delay (ID) improve while
   the combustion duration (CD) drops.

AB The official bio-economy strategies in Europe and Germany pursue a
   technology-based implementation pathway and stipulate a wide range of
   objectives to be achieved with a bio-based economy. Reviews of the
   scientific and societal debate have shown that the technology fix meets
   criticism and that there is a controversial discussion about possible
   ways to shape the transition process. Against this background, an online
   survey was carried out among scientists involved in a regional
   bio-economy research program in southern Germany in order to gain
   insight into their understanding of a bio-economy. Moreover, the survey
   provides information about cooperation and major challenges in the
   future development of three biomass utilization pathways: biogas,
   lignocellulose, and micro-algae. The analysis showed that a
   resource-oriented understanding of a bio-economy is favored. The
   political objectives for a European bio-economy are widely accepted, and
   it is expected that ongoing research can significantly contribute to
   achieving these goals. The two different pathways for shaping the
   bio-economy that are discussed in the debate-the technology-based
   approach and the socio-ecological approach-are considered compatible
   rather than contrary. Up to now, scientific cooperation has prevailed,
   while cooperation with societal stakeholders and end-users has played a
   minor role.

AB The microalgae can be used to capture and utilize CO2emitted by
   thermoelectric power plants or other sources. Mitigation of emissions of
   greenhouse effect gases results from converting biomass harvested from
   microalgae into renewable energy source such as biodiesel, bioethanol,
   biogas and other substitutes for fossil fuels. The microalgae are
   usually cultivated in large tanks with agitation produced by rotating
   blades or technically projected photobioreactors. Algae multiply
   suspended in water when supplied with the necessary nutrients and the
   multiplication rate increases on supply of additional CO2. Compared to
   other biological options to capture and use CO2, microalgae cultivation
   has advantages of high productivity potential, ability to capture
   nutrients from wastewater, waste utilization, sources of salt water and
   high efficiency in water use. Microalgae are an attractive alternative
   to oilseeds such as soybeans and palms, because of high lipid content
   leading to higher oil output per hectare. The microalgae can be
   cultivated in industrial areas, require much less space and low soil
   fertility. This review aims to present some updates about the potential
   of cultivating microalgae for biofuel production.

U2 6
AB Algae are fast growing eukaryotes and contribute more than two third of
   the planet's photosynthesis. Concerns of sustainability and food
   security linked with the limited availability of land for cultivation of
   biodiesel crops and oil seed bearing trees have resulted in growing
   attention on algae based biodiesel production. Algae are the oldest and
   original oil producers on earth. Biodiesel produced by algae is
   considered as Green House Gas neutral. Oil producing macro and micro
   algae thus present promising Climate Change mitigation opportunities.
   The investment and other barriers could be overcome by carbon credit
   benefits coming from compliance and voluntary carbon market. Clean
   Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol is attractive option
   for implementation of algal biodiesel based Climate Change mitigation
   projects in developing countries. There are opportunities in voluntary
   carbon markets also driven by the corporate social responsibility to
   offset emission footprints of activities, products and services of
   individuals and companies. Climate Change mitigation opportunities in
   algal biodiesel sector include - Bio-sequestration in green algal
   biomass; Biodiesel production and consumption as a replacement of
   conventional fossil fuel in energy generation activities; and energy
   generation from de-oiled algal biomass. Eligibility of these options has
   been assessed in the paper under the CDM and VCM (Voluntary carbon
   market) from the methodological aspects. Based on the assumptions from
   past studies it is estimated that the algal biodiesel alone can generate
   30 carbon credits per ha per year, offering the revenue of *360 per
   hectare per year. This is an estimate and varies on actual performance
   of algae, biodiesel plant and power plant.

AB Bio-oil contains plant, animal, fish, and micro-algae oil, and more than
   200 million tons are produced annually. However, many edible and
   non-edible bio-oils are still under development, and their value and
   feasibility have yet to be determined. The vast majority of bio-oils
   produced in the world have a very high unsaturated fatty acid content
   (70-98%), which could be used as a renewable, eco-friendly alternative
   to petroleum. Hydrolysis (or transesterification) with ethylene
   metathesis technology converts unsaturated fatty acids to C4-C30oil
   fragments. These oil fragments are a sustainable chemical technology
   used in chemical industry platform technology and carbon dioxide
   abatement green chemical technology, and as a petrochemical substitute.
   These platform chemicals also have their own market but are used as raw
   materials for other products (polymers, surfactants, synthetic
   lubricants, plasticizers, other specialty chemicals, general purpose
   chemicals, biofuels, etc.). The biodegradability and biocompatibility of
   the polymeric materials made from the oil mean that it is also possible
   to develop diverse functional products with high added value such as
   toothpaste, dandruff treatment shampoo, and melanin pigment removal
   cosmetics, medical and shape memory polymer materials. According to the
   cradle-to-gate analysis for environmental impact and economics, the
   total carbon dioxide emission reduction per ton of soybean oil was
   estimated to be 1.5 kg kg-1products. Moreover, the metathesis of soybean
   oil ($680/ton) with additional raw materials ($237.4) will generate a
   value that is 7.5 times higher at $6857. Due to the biodegradability and
   biocompatibility of the products made from bio-oils, it is expected that
   various functional products with high added value will be developed and
   that industrial applicability will be greatly expanded in the near
   future. In addition, for the development of various derivatives, fusion
   and cooperative research in chemical fields such as catalytic
   engineering, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, maintenance
   chemistry, and reaction engineering are essential.

AB This article reviews various technologies that have been used for
   biodiesel production till date, with a view to comparing commercial
   suitability of these methods on the basis of available feedstocks and
   associated challenges. This review shows that while emphasis is on the
   use of micro alga oil sources, the viability of the economics of the
   process is still in doubt. Homogenously catalyzed processes are the
   conventional technologies. However, their large-scale applicability is
   compromised due to their characteristic challenges. Batch processes and
   continuous processes are used for industrial purposes with typical
   capacity of 7.26-7.5 Gg y-1and 8-125 Gg y-1respectively, and
   heterogeneous catalysis may be sustainable for the continuous processes.
   Heterogeneous catalysts from renewable sources may be both
   environmentally and economically viable. Reactive distillation has the
   major advantage of combining the reaction and separation stages in a
   single unit, thereby significantly reducing capital costs and increasing
   opportunities for heat integration. This paper is a comprehensive
   overview of current technologies and appropriate options for scale-up
   development, providing the basis for a proposal for the exploitation of
   heterogeneous catalysts from natural sources to optimize biodiesel
   production.

AB Billions tons of fish waste generated annually by fish processing units
   pose significant environmental challenges, including emissions and
   degradation. However, a promising solution lies in converting this waste
   into valuable resources such as biofuel, pharmacological components,
   fertilizer and fodder. Biofuel derived from organic waste, seaweed and
   micro-algae, have been gaining attraction due to their pollution-free
   nature and several advantages over conventional fuels. Among the various
   waste sources, fish waste stands out as an ideal raw material for
   biodiesel production due to its non-toxic and biodegradable properties.
   Furthermore, biodiesel offers substantial reductions in emissions of air
   toxins, CO2, hydrocarbons, and particulates compared to traditional
   fuels. The conversion process involves the extraction and purification
   of fish oil from the waste, followed by transesterification resulting in
   the production of biodiesel and bio-gas, respectively. The efficiency of
   biodiesel from common carp waste in our experiment was measured to be
   80%, indicating that 80% of the energy content in the feedstock is
   successfully converted into biodiesel. This high efficiency makes
   biodiesel a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels in terms
   of energy conversion. To ensure the efficiency and functionality of
   biofuels, analytical techniques such as gas chromatography (GC-FID) and
   various other tests are employed to assess the confirmation. These
   analyses provide valuable insights into the composition and quality of
   the biofuels, contributing to their successful application as a
   sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to current fuels.

AB Biofuels derived from algae can have lower impact on the environment and
   the food supply than biofuels produced from crops. The strain selection,
   cultivation method, culture conditions and the chemical composition
   strongly influences the production costs but also the engine's
   performance and the exhaust gas emissions. The scope of this paper is to
   make a critical review about the impact of the use of biofuels produced
   from (micro) algae to power diesel engines. There is a huge disparity in
   the amount of papers published for algae culture, oil extraction, and
   biodiesel production compared to reporting performance on diesel
   engines. This paper presents an analysis of the papers published in this
   specific field. Generally, a reduction of torque and power output is
   reported. A wide range of blends up to B50 but also pure biodiesel has
   been tested. The blend showing results closest to diesel fuel appears to
   be B20. Several pollutants can be reduced if biofuels from different
   strains are used but an increase in NOx is generally reported,
   associated to higher temperatures in the combustion chamber. The use of
   emulsions instead of blends or neat biodiesel reveals a promising
   alternative with important reductions of CO2and NOx. However, the few
   reports for engine tests present some contradictions, or are lacking
   important information about the experiments. The assessment of biodiesel
   produced from algae or microalgae is a field hardly explored and until
   today some reference papers contain contradictory results or non-well
   studied behaviors as this survey demonstrates.

   of biodiesel fuel production from biomass were also described.
   Introduced actually changes in legal regulations being in force in the
   EU and USA, significantly limiting diesel production with the use of
   hitherto applied technologies, were characterized. The results of
   analyses were given, as concerning the effect of spatial (ILUC) and
   environmental changes on the crops being till now basic raw materials to
   generate diesel by transesterification methods. Usability of actual raw
   materials to diesel production considering three substrate generations,
   were discussed and evaluated. The effect of regulations being introduced
   on the commercial difficulties with biodiesel, as well as with the raw
   materials and substrates to its production, were indicated. Restrictions
   in utilization of other desirable substrates - the animal fats and
   micro-algae - as well as impediments resulted from different
   interpretation of regulations on the use of sewage sludge as biomass -
   were described. The status and prospects for hitherto existing and the
   future technologies of biodiesel production were presented, with
   particular attention put on the oilseed rape as a raw material of
   dominating, until now, importance in the EU.

AB Water management and treatment are high concern fields with several
   challenges due to increasing pollutants produced by human activity. It
   is imperative to find integral solutions and strategic measures with
   robust remediation. Landfill leachate production is a high concern
   emerging problem. Especially in low middle-income countries due to no
   proper local waste disposition regulation and non-engineered implemented
   methods to dispose of urban waste. These landfills can accumulate
   electronic waste and release heavy metals during the degradation
   process. Similar phenomena include expired pharmaceuticals like
   antibiotics. All these pollutants accumulated in leachate made it hard
   to dispose of or treat. Leachate produced in non-engineered landfills
   can permeate soils and reach groundwater, dragging different
   contaminants, including antibiotics and heavy metals, which eventually
   can affect the environment, changing soil properties and affecting
   wildlife. The presence of antibiotics in the environment is a problem
   with particular interest to solve, mainly to avoid the development of
   antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, which represent a future risk for
   human health with possible epidemic implications. It has been reported
   that the use of contaminated water with heavy metals to produce and grow
   vegetables is a risk for consumers, heavy metals effects in humans can
   include carcinogenic induction. This work explores the opportunities to
   use leachate as a source of nutrients to grow microalgae. Microalgae
   stand out as an alternative to bioremediate leachate, at the same time,
   microalgae produce high-value compounds that can be used in bioplastic,
   biofuels, and other industrial applications.

AB The current world energy crisis and increasing greenhouse gas emissions
   demand a shift from fossil-based fuels to alternative and sustainable
   biofuels. The innate potential of microalgae over traditional
   terrestrial feedstocks to provide a high-quality and sustainable fuel
   portfolio has been recognized. Microalgae are known to mitigate
   atmospheric CO2 and convert it to valuable metabolites and bioactive
   compounds. The high growth rate of microalgal biomass with no additional
   requirements of feed and arable land makes microalgae as realistic
   alternative to existing biofuels sources. Micro-algae can store more
   primary metabolites under abiotic stress, which can be used as a
   possible source of energy. These metabolite storing abilities of
   microalgae have become a point of interest for the scientific community
   as the accumulated lipids serve as potential feedstock for biodiesel
   production by transesterification, whereas the carbohydrates can be used
   as the feedstock for bioethanol production by fermentation. Although
   microalgae-based biofuels are viable sources of energy, their
   commercialization and deployment in the fuel market remain a challenge.
   As a result, efforts are being undertaken to make it more
   cost-effective. This review describes the microalgae biorefinery method
   for producing biofuel along with its commercial potential, latest
   research updates in biofuel research, strategies to improve the algal
   metabolite content along with the limitations of using algal biomass for
   biofuels with possible solutions to overcome those limitations.

AB In this review, we unveil the the use of microalgae as a feed ingredient
   in poultry nutrition. Microalgae are small-sized algae, unicellular,
   photosynthetic aquatic plants which have been studied as a natural
   marine resource for a number of economically applications, including
   animal feed. They are introduced to poultry diets mainly as a rich
   source of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA,
   22:6 n-3), but they can also serve as a protein, microelement, vitamin
   and antioxidants source, as well as a pigmentation agent for skin and
   egg yolks. The majority of experiments have shown that microalgae,
   mainly Spirulina and Chlorella sourced as a defatted biomass from
   biofuel production, can be successfully used as a feed ingredient in
   poultry nutrition. They can have beneficial effects on meat and egg
   quality, through an increased concentration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
   acids and carotenoids, and in regards to performance indices and immune
   function. Positive results were obtained when fresh microalgae biomass
   was used to replace antibiotic growth promoters in poultry diets.
   Because of their chemical composition, microalgae can be efficiently
   used in poultry nutrition to enhance the pigmentation and nutritional
   value of meat and eggs, as well as partial replacement of conventional
   dietary protein sources.

AB Sustainability is a key principle in natural resource management and it
   involves effective utilization of natural resources. Across the world,
   industrialization and the consequent emergence of economies reliant on
   fossil fuels have inevitably resulted in the adverse condition of
   atmospheric warming known as the greenhouse effect. Anthropogenic carbon
   dioxide (CO2) has been identified as one of the major causes. Out of
   several CO2sequestration methods, biological methods of sequestration
   using algae are energy efficient due to less energy requirement. Algae
   are autotrophic micro-organisms capable of converting CO2into
   carbohydrates and lipids in the presence of light by photosynthesis.
   Micro algae are cultivated for the treatment of domestic and industrial
   waste water and also for CO2sequestration. Many studies were carried out
   in the areas of CO2sequestration using algae. From those studies it was
   concluded that the algae can be effectively used for the treatment of
   wastewater and CO2sequestration. Hence, algal photosynthetic reaction
   may hold the key to reduce CO2emission in sustainable manner. Algae can
   be extensively used to capture CO2from power plants, steel, cement, oil,
   automobiles and many other industries and the resulting algal biomass
   not only be used for biofuel production but also for various industrial
   products like fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. Besides giving
   environmental and economic benefit, large scale algae cultivation can
   create a large number of jobs at different levels in the society.

AB Background: Hydrogen photo-production in green algae, catalyzed by the
   enzyme [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA), is considered a promising source of
   renewable clean energy. Yet, a significant increase in hydrogen
   production efficiency is necessary for industrial scale-up. We have
   previously shown that a major challenge to be resolved is the inferior
   competitiveness of HydA with NADPH production, catalyzed by
   ferredoxin-NADP+-reductase (FNR). In this work, we explored the in vivo
   hydrogen production efficiency of Fd-HydA, where the electron donor
   ferredoxin (Fd) is fused to HydA and expressed in the model
   organismChlamydomonas reinhardtii. Results: We show that once the
   Fd-HydA fusion gene is expressed in micro-algal cells ofC. reinhardtii,
   the fusion enzyme is able to intercept photosynthetic electrons and use
   them for efficient hydrogen production, thus supporting the previous
   observations made in vitro. We found that Fd-HydA has a 4.5-fold greater
   photosynthetic hydrogen production rate standardized for hydrogenase
   amount (PHPRH) than that of the native HydA in vivo. Furthermore, we
   provide evidence suggesting that the fusion protein is more resistant to
   oxygen than the native HydA. Conclusions: The in vivo photosynthetic
   activity of the Fd-HydA enzyme surpasses that of the native HydA and
   shows higher oxygen tolerance. Therefore, our results provide a solid
   platform for further engineering efforts towards efficient hydrogen
   production in microalgae through the expression of synthetic enzymes.

AB Uncontrolled anthropogenic activities and technological revolution
   increase fossil fuel consumption at higher rate that prompted
   researchers looking for alternative energy source to cover the current
   need and future demand of energy. Biomass of terrestrial crops has been
   studied as a promising source of renewable energy in last few decades
   however large scale production is still questionable because of lower
   productivity, indirect use of fossil fuel, lack of land availability and
   food vs. fuel conflict. These limitations of land based system fetch
   opportunity to look into untapped potential use of microalgae with high
   biomass productivity from saline and waste water stream. This
   unconventional way of feedstock generation can additionally produce
   value added products apart from clean energy. This review presents
   current scenario of microalgae applications in biofuel production and
   micro algae based high value bio-product industries leveraging
   environmental protection and waste utilization benefits. Microalgae
   cultivation, harvesting and biomass conversion technologies for
   biodiesel production have been reviewed based on adapting ancient
   learning to understand critical factors affecting overall productivity
   and economic viability. Dedicated efforts from technical experts are
   still required for economic viability of large scale biodiesel
   production in spite of positive finding at small scale. Several high
   value bio-products from microalgae amplified magnetism of trades for
   investment in this field. Microalgae cultivation intersects two key
   concern areas of global warming and water pollution control/water
   recycling by CO2sequestration and waste water utilization respectively.
   Integration of suitable upstream and downstream processing technologies
   with multiple product portfolio would make the microalgae bio-refinery
   economical viable.

AB Current industrial environmental regulations favor processes with
   Integrative Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). While several
   systems are regarded by different international directives as IPPC Best
   Available Techniques or Technologies (BAT), none of these systems are
   capable handling various pollutants of both gaseous and aquatic
   effluents. Additional hinder to a BAT-IPPC complete procedure are
   hazardous or uneconomical byproducts of the IPPC processes and
   significant auxiliary costs for consumables and energy. The current
   research and subsequent projects are aimed to the development of a
   Biological Integrative Pollution Prevention and Control (Bio-IPPC)
   system. Such system can be incorporated in various industrial processes,
   in a way that the byproduct is without hazardous potential and may be
   used as an economical raw material. The main initiative and heart of
   these systems is a micro-algae reactor, which is capable of treating
   various types of industrial pollutants both in the gaseous and aquatic
   phases. The algae nutrition is through thin-film circulation of the
   aquatic effluent and the reactor atmosphere is enriched by flue gases.
   The excessive algal biomass may be utilized for economic purposes
   starting with animal feedstock, through organic fertilizer and as
   industrial raw material for biofuels production or direct energy
   production. The first industrial project is a wastewater (WW) polishing
   stage to an industry zone WW treatment facility, which ensures high
   level effluent purification and assimilation of greenhouse gases, which
   are released during the WW bioremediation process. The second industrial
   application aims to treat aquatic and gaseous effluents from coal
   propelled power plants. The raw algal material from both projects
   although very different, is used for the development of new efficient
   scheme for bioethanol production. In summary, the system presented is an
   actual Bio-IPPC that can interactively treat several industrial
   effluents, while utilizing the algal biomass as a profitable raw
   material.

AB The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of biogas-fed Solid Oxide Fuel Cell
   (SOFC) integrated with a CO2 recovery system is presented in this work.
   The goal of the work is to evaluate the environmental performance of an
   SOFC fueled with sewage biogas and to compare it with traditional
   technologies (internal combustion engines and microturbines) using the
   same fuel. CO2 recovery is performed through a tubular photobioreactor,
   fixing the recovered carbon in the form of a micro-algae. The analysis
   takes into account both the biogas production line (anaerobic digester)
   and its exploitation into the fuel cell (i.e., the power generator).
   Results show that the SOFC manufacturing activity is highly intensive
   since it requires a large amount of use of electricity. During
   operation, instead, the highest burden is associated with the fuel
   production. We analyzed two scenarios for biogas operation underlining
   the benefits of introducing sludge pre-thickening before the anaerobic
   digestion process. The use of a sludge pre-thickening system can reduce
   the inlet flow of natural gas into the plant, thus affecting the fuel
   chain contribution and reducing the overall impact. The photobioreactor
   results in consuming more energy than what it produces (looking at the
   operation phase only; the manufacturing phase was not even included) and
   being responsible for more carbon emissions than the amount fixed in
   algae. On the other side, data for the photobioreactor system were based
   on a real system at the proof-of-concept level. Therefore significant
   improvements are expected for an industrial-size system. Finally, the
   SOFC environmental burdens have been compared with main competitors in
   the same field (internal combustion engines and microturbines), showing
   the superior environmental performance. The proposed energy system is
   thus an interesting choice for cleaner energy production.

AB The preliminary assessment of a cost-effective flow-sheet for the

   The study was based on approximated cost-estimation methods integrated
   with the simulation software Aspen Plus. Several scenarios were
   investigated to compare costs regarding the main steps of the biodiesel
   production process. Ranges of input variables from downstream literature
   and experimental data were used to simulate the sections that define
   concrete process routes for production of algal biofuels: the extraction
   of the lipid fraction from aqueous solution, the lipid
   transesterification, and the methyl esters (FAMEs) and glycerol recover.
   The design variables were selected so as to correspond to the main
   degrees of freedom of the process: number of equilibrium stages, solvent
   recycle flow rate, transesterification time, methanol to
   triacylglycerols ratio, plate number and reflux ratio of the
   distillation unit for methanol recovery. The cost estimation for the
   conceptual design of the flowsheet dedicated to the FAMEs production
   from microalgae was carried out according to Happel's method. Data were
   worked out to assess the venture profit and the selling price (s) for
   mass unit of FAMEs. The minimization ofswas adopted as the objective
   function. A preliminary determination of plausible values of the cost
   for unit of mass of biodiesel was attempted as a function of operating
   conditions.

U1 0

AB Marine algae contain lipids and fatty acids up to 30 per cent as
   membrane components, storage products, metabolites and sources of
   energy. Lipid accumulation in algae typically occurs during periods of
   environmental stress, including growth under nutrient-deficient
   conditions. Biochemical studies have suggested that acetyl-CoA
   carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-containing enzyme that catalyzes an early
   step in fatty acid biosynthesis, may be involved in the control of this
   lipid accumulation process. Therefore, it may be possible to enhance
   lipid production rates by increasing the activity of this enzyme via
   genetic engineering. These microalgal strains with high oil or lipid
   content are of great interest in the search for a sustainable feedstock
   for the production of biodiesel. While a number of bio-feedstock is
   currently being experimented for biodiesel production, algae have
   emerged as one of the most promising sources for bio diesel production.
   Though research into algae as a source for bio diesel is not new, the
   current oil crises and fast depleting fossil oil reserves have made it
   more imperative for organizations and countries to invest more time and
   efforts into research on such suitable renewable feedstock. Though some
   of the countries have already advocated this feedstock and have started
   large projects on algal biodiesel, but still it has to be implemented at
   large scale in a country like India where the total coast line,
   excluding its islands is 5495KM in length. Indian coastline is one of
   the most rich in terms of macro and micro algae. Therefore we have the
   potential to harness this magnanimous resource into a less polluting
   source of renewable energy. However we still need to focus on commercial
   cultivation and production of bio diesel from marine algae which
   requires state of the art infrastructure as well as policy support. This
   can be a step forward to benefit human welfare in the global scenario of
   fuel crisis and its natural availability would affect the economic rates
   of the underprivileged population.

AB This study quantifies the synergies between agriculture and bioenergy
   considering biodiesel production as part of a set of systemic
   initiatives. We present a case study in Ecuador taking into account the
   recent government measures aimed at developing the bioenergy sector.
   Four scenarios have been evaluated through a newly designed systemic
   scheme of circular-economy initiatives. These scenarios encompass three
   production pathways covering three energy crops: palm oil (PO),
   microalgae in open ponds (M1) and microalgae in laminar photobioreactors
   (M2). We have applied Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) methodology
   considering the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)
   as the main evaluation criteria. In terms of private investment,
   biodiesel production from PO is more attractive than from M2. However,
   regarding efficiency and effectiveness of public funds, M2 is superior
   to PO because the public BCR and NPV are higher, and the pressure on
   agricultural land is lower. Moreover, M2 as part of a systemic approach
   presents a better carbon balance. These findings show that, under a
   systemic approach based on circular economy, strategies like the one
   analyzed in this study are economically feasible and may have a
   promising future.

AB The new microalgae-to-biofuels chains for producing diesel and ethanol

   the break-even prices of diesel and ethanol are estimated about
   US$0.49/kg and US$2.61/kg, respectively, the internal rate of return
   (IRR) is close to 29.21%, and the commercial prices and yield of
   products dominate the profitability of this project. According to life
   cycle analysis (LCA) standards, the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions for producing diesel and ethanol are 0.039 kg CO2-eq/MJ FAME
   and 0.112 kg CO2-eq/MJ EtOH, respectively. It is verified that the
   process integration of the heat recovery scheme, the entrainer recovery
   tower, and CO2 recycling can effectively reduce life-cycle GHG emissions
   of this design. Through a specific optimization algorithm under
   different lipid contents and 180 scenario combinations for the
   cultivation and pretreatment processes, the compromise solutions between
   the maximum total revenue and the minimum environmental impact can be
   found.

   Advancements are required in a few aspects like improvement in algae
   processing, energy investment, and cost analysis of microalgae
   biorefinery. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the modern work by
   understanding the knowledge gaps and hotspots driving business scale up.

AB Microalgae cultivating in wastewater enabling nutrient uptake for
   biomass and biofuel generation is regarded as a promising pathway to
   increase sustainability of microalgae biofuel production process. A
   source-separated nutrient organization approach for the process of
   wastewater-based microalgae biofuel is proposed in this study.
   Comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) method and Techno-economic
   analysis (TEA) approach are employed to assess sustainability and
   economic performance of the proposed nutrient approach. Two scenarios
   are used to validate our study. Scenario 1 is based on the
   source-separated nutrient delivery approach with microalgae integrated
   wastewater in tertiary treatment. Scenario 2 is based on
   non-separated-point nutrient delivery policy and microalgae integrated
   with secondary wastewater treatment. The results show that the
   source-separated nutrient approach is effective for reducing the
   environmental impacts and increasing commercial potential of microalgae
   biofuel.

AB Techno-economic analyses (TEAs) and life cycle assessments (LCAs) of
   algal biofuels often focus on locations in suboptimal latitudes for
   algal cultivation, which can under-represent the sustainability
   potential of the technology. This study identifies the optimal global
   productivity potential, environmental impacts, and economic viability of
   algal biofuels by using validated biophysical and sustainability
   modeling. The biophysical model simulates growth rates of Scenedesmus
   obliquusbased on temperature, photoinhibition, and respiration effects
   at 6685 global locations. Region-specific labor costs, construction
   factors, and tax rates allow for spatially resolved TEA, while the LCA
   includes regional impacts of electricity, hydrogen, and nutrient markets
   across ten environmental categories. The analysis identifies optimal
   locations for algal biofuel production in terms of environmental impacts
   and economic viability which are shown to follow biomass yields.
   Modeling results highlight the global variability of productivity with
   maximum yields ranging between 24.8 and 27.5 g m-2 d-1 in equatorial
   regions. Environmental impact results show favorable locations tracked
   with low-carbon electricity grids, with the well-to-wheels global
   warming potential (GWP) ranging from 31 to 45 g CO2eq MJ-1 in South
   America and Central Africa. When including direct land use change
   impacts, the GWP ranged between 44 and 55 g CO2eq MJ-1 in these
   high-productivity regions. Low-carbon electricity also favors air
   quality and eutrophication impacts. The TEA shows that minimum algal
   fuel prices of $1.89-$2.15 per liter of gasoline-equivalent are possible
   in southeast Asia and Venezuela. This discussion focuses on the
   challenges and opportunities to reduce fuel prices and the environmental
   impacts of algal biofuels in various global regions.

U2 65
AB Contamination of the biosphere by heavy metals has been rising, due to
   accelerated anthropogenic activities, and is nowadays, a matter of
   serious global concern. Removal of such inorganic pollutants from
   aquatic environments via biological processes has earned great
   popularity, for its cost-effectiveness and high efficiency, compared to
   conventional physicochemical methods. Among candidate organisms,
   microalgae offer several competitive advantages; phycoremediation has
   even been claimed as the next generation of wastewater treatment
   technologies. Furthermore, integration of microalgae-mediated wastewater
   treatment and bioenergy production adds favorably to the economic
   feasibility of the former process-with energy security coming along with
   environmental sustainability. However, poor biomass productivity under
   abiotic stress conditions has hindered the large-scale deployment of
   microalgae. Recent advances encompassing molecular tools for genome
   editing, together with the advent of multiomics technologies and
   computational approaches, have permitted the design of tailor-made
   microalgal cell factories, which encompass multiple beneficial traits,
   while circumventing those associated with the bioaccumulation of
   unfavorable chemicals. Previous studies unfolded several routes through
   which genetic engineering-mediated improvements appear feasible
   (encompassing sequestration/uptake capacity and specificity for heavy
   metals); they can be categorized as metal transportation, chelation, or
   biotransformation, with regulation of metal- and oxidative stress
   response, as well as cell surface engineering playing a crucial role
   therein. This review covers the state-of-the-art metal stress mitigation
   mechanisms prevalent in microalgae, and discusses putative and tested
   metabolic engineering approaches, aimed at further improvement of those
   biological processes. Finally, current research gaps and future
   prospects arising from use of transgenic microalgae for heavy metal
   phycoremediation are reviewed.

AB Algal biofuel production covers from algal strain selection,
   cultivation, biomass yield, biofuel conversion processes, process
   enhancement, and cost/benefit analysis. Algal strains were tested for
   lipid content and growth rate where its different strains like
   Nannochloropsis oculata and Chlorella vulgaris were subjected to test,
   Different cultivation systems were tested for biomass productivity and
   lipid extraction efficiency, and they include open ponds and closed
   photobioreactors. Methods like centrifugation and ultrasonication were
   looked as option for biomass collection and pre-treatment. Several
   extraction and fermentation techniques were used in biodiesel,
   bioethanol and biogas production of several biofuel pathways. Besides
   the genetic engineering, nutrition, and photoperiod manipulation
   approaches were used to improve the lipid yield and stress resistance.
   Thus, the economic feasibility analysed via cost-benefit analysis and
   environmental concerns by the life cycle analyses. Practical aspects of
   using the process were demonstrated by a collection of case studies and
   pilot runs on the laboratory scale. Altogether, this research points out
   the complex strategies and fundamental factors also known as the
   critical parameters, which should be achieved for the progress of the
   algal biofuel to be a part of sustainable energy system.

U2 85
AB Increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has already become a dire
   threat to the human race and Earth's ecology. Microalgae are recommended
   to be engineered as CO2fixers in biorefinery, which play crucial roles
   in responding climate change and accelerating the transition to a
   sustainable future. This review sorted through each segment of
   microalgal biorefinery to explore the potential for its practical
   implementation and commercialization, offering valuable insights into
   research trends and identifies challenges that needed to be addressed in
   the development process. Firstly, the known mechanisms of microalgal
   photosynthetic CO2fixation and the approaches for strain improvement
   were summarized. The significance of process regulation for
   strengthening fixation efficiency and augmenting competitiveness was
   emphasized, with a specific focus on CO2and light optimization
   strategies. Thereafter, the massive potential of microalgal refineries
   for various bioresource production was discussed in detail, and the
   integration with contaminant reclamation was mentioned for economic and
   ecological benefits. Subsequently, economic and environmental impacts of
   microalgal biorefinery were evaluated via life cycle assessment (LCA)
   and techno-economic analysis (TEA) to lit up commercial feasibility.
   Finally, the current obstacles and future perspectives were discussed
   objectively to offer an impartial reference for future researchers and
   investors.

AB A large percentage of world's eutrophication is attributed to the
   livestock industry, which is responsible for producing over 14% of the
   global anthropogenic greenhouse gasses emissions (GHG). In Mexico, very
   few livestock producers have the necessary infrastructure to treat their
   livestock waste (LW) and most fail to comply with environmental
   regulations. The treatment of LW through a circular bioeconomy approach
   can mitigate these negative environmental impacts, while simultaneously
   producing value-added products. The present work aimed to characterize
   the spatial variation of the LW generated in cattle, swine, and poultry
   farms in Jalisco, Mexico. Total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (TP), and
   organic matter released from these production units were estimated,
   along with the associated GHG, considering the standard practice of
   uncontrolled release. An alternative management scenario using anaerobic
   digestion (AD) combined with microalgae-based wastewater treatment
   (MbWT) was evaluated by developing a software-based techno-economic
   analysis, showing that a centralized LW treatment system could represent
   a feasible solution to comply the legislation while generating
   high-protein biomass for animal feed. Besides, the reduction in GHG
   represents an opportunity for carbon credits trading in voluntary
   markets for livestock producers in Mexico. Insights are provided
   regarding the economical, technical, and sociocultural challenges that
   must be overcome to transition towards more sustainable livestock
   production practices in Jalisco, Mexico, and other developing regions
   around the globe.

AB The impact on water supplies and the amount of wastewater produced at
   the same time have both greatly grown because of the constantly growing
   population. The need to upgrade the traditional wastewater treatment
   process is driven by the shortage of water resources and worries about
   environmental degradation. This review will highlight the use of
   microalgae in domestic wastewater treatment. Algae-based domestic
   wastewater treatment systems have advantages such as adapting to
   different environmental conditions. They are effective, economical, and
   environmentally friendly methods to remove nutrients, pollutants and
   improve water quality. Microalgae species such as Chlorella vulgaris and
   Scenedesmus obliquus have shown excellent results in treating domestic
   sewage and have the potential to produce biofuel. Algae-based solutions
   for rural wastewater treatment offer affordability, nutrient removal,
   water reuse and environmental sustainability. Algae-based wastewater
   treatment effectively removes micro-plastics, provides high biomass
   yields and productivity. Life cycle analysis (LCA) of algae-based
   municipal wastewater treatment looks at energy use and environmental
   impacts. By reducing waste and producing useful by-products such as
   fertilizers and biofuels, algae processing systems can support the
   circular economy. The "All-Gas Project", the Algae-based Factory, "Algae
   Discovery Centre" and the "Algal Septic Tank" are all successful
   examples of algae-based wastewater treatment in developed and developing
   countries. Optimizing processing methods, improving algae, maximizing
   growth conditions, integrating with other processing methods, and
   scaling up for commercial applications are some future research
   opportunities. Although there are still challenges in process
   optimization, algae-based municipal wastewater treatment is an
   inexpensive and environmentally friendly option with advantages in terms
   of nitrogen removal, biomass utilization, energy efficiency, and
   resource recovery.

AB In this study, a novel two-step integrated process is proposed to
   facilitate the microalgae biofuel production as well as fresh cheese
   whey wastewater (FCWW) treatment simultaneously. The pre- and
   post-treatment of high-strength FCWW were performed by means of
   coagulation and algal cultivation, respectively. The pre-treatment of
   FCWW for maximum removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity
   (TUR) and total solids (TS) as responses was obtained by statistical
   optimization of coagulation parameters. The maximum removal of COD, TUR
   and TS at the optimum level of variables was obtained as 68.09%, 47.80%
   and 73.63%, respectively. The pre-treated FCWW was further treated by
   Chlorella pyrenoidosa and observed a significant reduction in the
   above-mentioned responses (87-94%). The maximum algal biomass yield and
   lipid productivity were observed as 2.44 g L-1 and 77.41 mg L-1 day-1,
   respectively. Based on promising results of FCWW treatment and its use
   as a third-generation biodiesel feedstock, a cost-benefit analysis of
   the developed process was assessed for microalgal oil production. The
   total profit earned by the integrated process model was $9.59 million
   year-1. Accordingly, the estimated production cost of algal oil (TAG)
   from the developed system was estimated to be $79.03 per barrel.

AB Production of economically competitive and environmentally sustainable
   algal biofuel faces technical challenges that are subject to high
   uncertainties. Here we identify target values for algal productivity and
   financing conditions required to achieve a biocrude selling price of $5
   per gallon and beneficial environmental impacts. A modeling
   framework-combining process design, techno-economic analysis, life cycle
   assessment, and uncertainty analysis-was applied to two conversion
   pathways: (1) "fuel only (HTL)", using hydrothermal liquefaction to
   produce biocrude, heat and power, and (2) "fuel and feed", using wet
   extraction to produce biocrude and lipid-extracted algae, which can
   substitute components of animal and aqua feeds. Our results suggest that
   with supporting policy incentives, the "fuel and feed" scenario will
   likely achieve a biocrude selling price of less than $5 per gallon at a
   productivity of 39 g/m2/day, versus 47 g/m2/day for the "fuel only
   (HTL)" scenario. Furthermore, if lipid-extracted algae are used to
   substitute fishmeal, the process has a 50% probability of reaching $5
   per gallon with a base case productivity of 23 g/m2/day. Scenarios with
   improved economics were associated with beneficial environmental impacts
   for climate change, ecosystem quality, and resource depletion, but not
   for human health.

AB Although there are several studies on the hydrothermal carbonization of
   microalgae biomass for value-added products and their potential
   environmental impacts, the feasibility of scaling-up and the
   environmental and economic analysis need to be investigated. This study
   produced solid biofuel and biofertilizer under two operating conditions
   (170°C, 10 min, 7 bar; or 130°C, 50 min, 2 bar, respectively). Also,
   investigated the environmental performance and techno-economical
   viability of producing solid biofuel and biofertilizer from microalgae.
   Scale-up modeling used Aspen Plus software to obtain optimized
   production processes, energy data, equipment requirements, and costs,
   which were used to support the economic and environmental analyses. The
   Recipe Midpoint method showed that the solid biofuel had a higher
   environmental impact than the biofertilizer, especially in the
   Freshwater Eutrophication category (almost 7 times higher), Fossil
   Resource Scarcity (4.2 times higher), Global Warming, and Marine
   Ecotoxicity (both around 2.7 times higher). The damage assessment
   results showed that the production of solid biofuel was more impactful,
   with Human Health impacts 2 times higher, Ecosystem 1.6 times higher,
   and Resource 4.3 times higher than those caused by biofertilizer
   production. The biofertilizer production scenario emerged as the most
   economically viable option for hydrothermal carbonization valorization.
   The negative net present value and the inability to achieve the return
   on investment within a 30-year timeframe made the solid biofuel
   production scenario unviable. Thus, biofertilizer production from
   hydrothermal carbonization of microalgae biomass cultivated in
   wastewater is technically, economically, and environmentally feasible,
   whereas the same cannot be said for the biofuel evaluated.

AB Biowastes are marked sources of global greenhouse gas emissions,
   however, locally accessible biowaste could be a sustainable source for
   biofuel production to generate clean energy. This study examined the
   environmental sustainability and economic feasibility of using
   co-pyrolysed sewage sludge (SS) with lignocellulosic and algal biomass
   for liquid and gaseous fuel production from the perspective of life
   cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis. Wastewater-grown
   microalgae, sawdust, and wheat straw were selected as co-feed materials,
   and three mixing ratios (25, 50, and 75 wt%) of each feedstock with SS
   were examined. Wastewater-grown microalgae and SS were obtained from
   wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which were assumed to be near the
   pyrolysis plant facility, obviating the need for transportation. An
   Aspen simulation was used to estimate the amount of energy recovered
   from the pyrolysis as gaseous fuel for electricity and heat generation
   via gas turbines. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify
   future considerations for SS co-pyrolysis to make it a more
   environmentally and economically viable industrial process for producing
   liquid and gaseous fuels. The co-pyrolysis of SS with biomass reduced
   the overall environmental burden, with sawdust co-pyrolysis
   outperforming wheat straw and microalgal co-pyrolysis. All scenarios
   achieved a high net positive energy balance (from 2,595 to 6,323
   kWh/1,000 kg bio-oil) and reduced global warming potential (GWP) (from
   -793 to -1,970 kg CO2eq/1,000 kg bio-oil). Sawdust co-pyrolysis resulted
   in the highest GWP reduction (from -1,510 to -1,970 kg CO2eq/1,000 kg
   bio-oil) and energy recovery (from 5,551 to 6,323 kWh/1,000 kg bio-oil).
   Energy recovery from gaseous fuel through gas turbine operation
   generated a process energy demand of 23%-224%. Sawdust co-pyrolysis
   exhibited the highest net present worth (NPW) of 6.16 million CAD.
   Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the GWP and terrestrial
   ecotoxicity potential were affected by the transportation of sawdust and
   wheat straw. Overall, the co-pyrolysis of SS with both lignocellulosic
   and algal biomass is sustainable and economically feasible for producing
   liquid and gaseous fuels and treating hazardous waste originating from
   WWTPs, thereby facilitating environmental sustainability and a circular
   economy from the sale of pyrolysis products. Broader implication of this
   study is using effective catalysts to further strengthen the
   sustainability and increase the profitability of the co-pyrolysis
   process, which has not been yet investigated.

AB This study describes a techno-economic analysis to evaluate the economic
   feasibility of transportation fuel production by hydrothermal
   liquefaction (HTL) of defatted microalgae followed by hydroprocessing of
   the resulting bio-crude. A 2000 dry tonne per day biorefinery produces
   112 dam3of gasoline-range fuels and 121 dam3of diesel-range fuels per
   year. We estimate the total project investment is 504 M$ and the annual
   operating cost is 158 M$. The minimum fuel-selling price (MFSP) is 679 $
   m-3assuming a 10% internal rate of return assuming 30-year plant life.
   Sensitivity analysis shows that MFSP is most sensitive to product fuel
   yield indicating the relative importance of HTL conversion performance.
   Feedstock cost also strongly influences MFSP, which varied between 584 $
   m-3and 869 $ m-3for feedstock cost of 33 and 132 $ dry tonne-1,
   respectively. A Monte-Carlo analysis suggests an 80% probability of MFSP
   being between 607 and 833 $ m-3.

AB The deployment of small-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) plants for the

   associated production of renewable energy at a local level has recently
   attracted attention as opposed to full-scale centralized plants. In this
   work, we evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of an
   integrated process comprising small-scale AD of OFMSW followed by
   microalgae cultivation, to valorise the waste streams of the former
   (off-gases produced by combined heat and power generation and liquid
   digestate) for the production of valuable biomass to be destined to
   either the biofertilizers or the biostimulants markets, in agreement
   with a circular economy perspective. The material and energy balances
   were obtained by means of process simulation for a plant located in
   Northern Italy, taken as a reference. The analysis revealed that,
   although the high turbidity of the digestate strongly hinders biomass
   production, the process is profitable from a techno-economic
   perspective, with discounted payback time ranging from 3.3 to 7.1 years,
   and profitability indexes greater than 1. The low market price of
   biofertilizers makes it the less profitable choice, even compared to the
   AD process alone, while selling the biomass for biostimulants
   applications could strongly increase the process profitability.

AB Combining algae cultivation and wastewater treatment for biofuel
   production is considered the feasible way for resource utilization. An
   updated comprehensive techno-economic analysis method that integrates
   resources availability into techno-economic analysis was employed to
   evaluate the wastewater-based algal biofuel production with the
   consideration of wastewater treatment improvement, greenhouse gases
   emissions, biofuel production costs, and coproduct utilization. An
   innovative approach consisting of microalgae cultivation on centrate
   wastewater, microalgae harvest through flocculation, solar drying of
   biomass, pyrolysis of biomass to bio-oil, and utilization of
   co-products, was analyzed and shown to yield profound positive results
   in comparison with others. The estimated break even selling price of
   biofuel ($2.23/gallon) is very close to the acceptable level. The
   approach would have better overall benefits and the internal rate of
   return would increase up to 18.7% if three critical components, namely
   cultivation, harvest, and downstream conversion could achieve
   breakthroughs.

SO Journal of Cleaner Production
VL 306
PY 2021
U1 0
U2 20
AB The emergence of environmental and sustainability regulations as well as
   the limited availability of fossil fuels have brought the notion of
   gradually substituting petroleum products with biofuels into the
   limelight. The commercialization and large-scale adoption of cellulosic
   biofuel (second-generation biofuel) and microalgae biofuel
   (third-generation biofuel) have been hampered by their poor economic
   performance. Although the production wastes of biofuel can be utilized
   as input materials to enhance resource utilization efficiency,
   environmental sustainability and economic viability in each generation,
   rarely existing research has been conducted on the integration between
   these two generations. To fill this research gap, a novel industrial
   symbiosis (IS) design for the co-production of second- and
   third-generation biofuels is proposed in this paper. The material flow,
   energy flow, cost performance, and environmental impact models are
   established considering the interactions of stakeholders in the IS
   system. Four scenarios, consisting of the baseline case without IS and
   three IS cases with different microalgae species, are comprehensively
   compared in terms of various economic and sustainability performance
   indicators. Compared to the baseline case, the results reveal that the
   synergies in the bioenergy IS system render an annual manufacturing cost
   reduction of >10% in all IS scenarios. It is also discovered that the
   symbiotic design can lead to a 36% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, a 9.4% decrease in eutrophication potential (EP), and a 7.5%
   reduction in acidification potential (AP) when adopting the same species
   of microalgae. The synergies among the bioenergy IS system stakeholders
   are proved to be viable and beneficial to enhance the economic viability
   and environmental sustainability.

AB Background: Seasonal variation in microalgae production is a significant
   challenge to developing cost-competitive algae biofuels. Summer
   production can be three to five times greater than winter production,
   which could result in winter biomass shortages and summer surpluses at
   algae biorefineries. While the high water content (80%, wet basis) of
   harvested microalgae biomass makes drying an expensive approach to
   preservation, it is not an issue for ensiling. Ensiling relies on lactic
   acid fermentation to create anaerobic acidic conditions, which limits
   further microbial degradation. This study explores the feasibility of
   preserving microalgae biomass through wet anaerobic storage ensiling
   over 30 and 180 days of storage, and it presents a techno-economic
   analysis that considers potential cost implications. Results:
   HarvestedScenedesmus acutusbiomass untreated (anaerobic) or supplemented
   with 0.5% sulfuric acid underwent robust lactic acid fermentation
   (lactic acid content of 6-9%, dry basis) lowering the pH to 4.2. Dry
   matter losses after 30 days ranged from 10.8 to 15.5% depending on the
   strain and treatment without additional loss over the next 150 days.
   Long-term storage of microalgae biomass resulted in lactic acid
   concentrations that remained high (6%, dry basis) with a low pH
   (4.2-4.6). Detailed biochemical composition revealed that protein and
   lipid content remained unaffected by storage while carbohydrate content
   was reduced, with greater dry matter loss associated with greater
   reduction in carbohydrate content, primarily affecting glucan content.
   Techno-economic analysis comparing wet storage to drying and dry storage
   demonstrated the cost savings of this approach. The most realistic dry
   storage scenario assumes a contact drum dryer and aboveground carbon
   steel storage vessels, which translates to a minimum fuel selling price
   (MFSP) of $3.72/gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE), whereas the most
   realistic wet storage scenario, which includes belowground, covered wet
   storage pits translates to an MFSP of $3.40/GGE. Conclusions: Microalgae
   biomass can be effectively preserved through wet anaerobic storage,
   limiting dry matter loss to below 10% over 6 months with minimal
   degradation of carbohydrates and preservation of lipids and proteins.
   Techno-economic analysis indicates that wet storage can reduce overall
   biomass and fuel costs compared to drying and dry storage.

AB Ethylene is a petrochemical produced in large volumes worldwide. It
   serves as a building block for a wide variety of plastics, textiles, and
   chemicals, and can be converted into liquid transportation fuels. There
   is great interest in the development of technologies that produce
   ethylene from renewable resources, such as biologically derived CO2 and
   biomass. One of the metabolic pathways used by microbes to produce
   ethylene is via an ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE). By expressing a
   bacterial EFE gene in a cyanobacterium, ethylene has been produced
   through photosynthetic carbon fixation. Here, we present a conceptual
   design and techno-economic analysis of a process of biofuel production
   based on the upgradation of ethylene generated by the recombinant
   cyanobacterium. This analysis focuses on potential near-term to
   long-term cost projections for the integrated process of renewable fuels
   derived from ethylene. The cost projections are important in showing the
   potential of this technology and determining research thrusts needed to
   reach target goals. The base case for this analysis is a midterm
   projection using tubular photobioreactors for cyanobacterial growth and
   ethylene production, cryogenic distillation for ethylene separation and
   purification, a two-step Ziegler oligomerization process with subsequent
   hydrotreatment and upgradation for fuel production, and a wastewater
   treatment process that utilizes anaerobic digestion of cyanobacterial
   biomass. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) for the midterm
   projection is $15.07 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE). Near-term and
   long-term projections are $28.66 per GGE and $5.36 per GGE,
   respectively. Single- and multi-point sensitivity analyses are conducted
   to determine the relative effect that chosen variables could have on the
   overall costs. This analysis identifies several key variables for
   improving the overall process economics and outlines strategies to guide
   future research directions. The productivity of ethylene has the largest
   effect on cost and is calculated based on a number of variables that are
   incorporated into this cost model (i.e., quantum requirement, photon
   transmission efficiency, and the percent of energy going to either
   ethylene or cyanobacterial biomass production).

AB The aim of this study was to assess the potential environmental impacts
   associated with high rate algal ponds (HRAP) systems for wastewater
   treatment and resource recovery in small communities. To this aim, a
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out evaluating two alternatives:
   (i) a HRAP system for wastewater treatment where microalgal biomass is
   valorized for energy recovery (biogas production); (ii) a HRAP system
   for wastewater treatment where microalgal biomass is reused for
   nutrients recovery (biofertilizer production). Additionally, both
   alternatives were compared to a typical small-sized activated sludge
   system. An economic assessment was also performed. The results showed
   that HRAP system coupled with biogas production appeared to be more
   environmentally friendly than HRAP system coupled with biofertilizer
   production in the climate change, ozone layer depletion, photochemical
   oxidant formation, and fossil depletion impact categories. Different
   climatic conditions have strongly influenced the results obtained in the
   eutrophication and metal depletion impact categories. In fact, the HRAP
   system located where warm temperatures and high solar radiation are
   predominant (HRAP system coupled with biofertilizer production) showed
   lower impact in those categories. Additionally, the characteristics
   (e.g. nutrients and heavy metals concentration) of microalgal biomass
   recovered from wastewater appeared to be crucial when assessing the
   potential environmental impacts in the terrestrial acidification,
   particulate matter formation and toxicity impact categories. In terms of
   costs, HRAP systems seemed to be more economically feasible when
   combined with biofertilizer production instead of biogas. On the whole,
   implementing HRAPs instead of activated sludge systems might increase
   sustainability and cost-effectiveness of wastewater treatment in small
   communities, especially if implemented in warm climate regions and
   coupled with biofertilizer production.

AB Using liquid digestate and flue gases from a microalgae cultivation in a
   biogas plant, enables nutrient and carbon uptake reducing the costs for
   nutrients for microalgae cultivation and reducing problems associated
   with the overproduction of digestate. The present study aims to examine
   the environmental impacts and economic aspects of a novel technology for
   microalgal cultivation. In particular, a combined LCA and LCC from a
   novel microalgae cultivation pilot system coupled with an operating
   biogas plant is proposed. The technological concept investigated aims to
   evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of the use of digestate
   and CHP flue gases from biogas a plant to sustain algal growth. Two
   scenarios were compared: (i) a business-as-usual (i.e. baseline
   scenario) defined as a traditional biogas plant without microalgae
   cultivation, (ii) a scenario with a scaled-up microalgae cultivation
   technology (Scenario 2) to highlight differences and evaluate the
   overall environmental and economic feasibility of a commercial scale.
   The comparison showed that the baseline scenario is slightly more
   advantageous in environmental performances than that associated with
   microalgae cultivation. The techno-economic assessment shows an economic
   feasibility with a positive NPV value (i.e. 2 573 935 ) and good IRR
   (i.e. 14). The implementation of Scenario 2 with microalgae cultivation
   is found primarily in its relatively low operational costs as the
   thermal and electrical energy, digestate, and CO2required for operation
   and algal growth come from the associated biogas plant. However,
   technical improvements should be considered to reduce the capital costs
   associated with the construction of microalgae cultivation plant.

AB Microalgae have demonstrated a large potential in biotechnology as a
   source of various macromolecules (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids)
   and high-added value products (pigments, poly-unsaturated fatty acids,
   peptides, exo-polysaccharides, etc.). The production of biomass at a
   large scale becomes more economically feasible when it is part of a
   biorefinery designed within the circular economy concept. Thus, the aim
   of this critical review is to highlight and discuss challenges and
   future trends related to the multi-product microalgae-based
   biorefineries, including both phototrophic and mixotrophic cultures
   treating wastewater and the recovery of biomass as a source of valuable
   macromolecules and high-added and low-value products (biofertilizers and
   biostimulants). The therapeutic properties of some microalgae-bioactive
   compounds are also discussed. Novel trends such as the screening of
   species for antimicrobial compounds, the production of bioplastics using
   wastewater, the circular economy strategy, and the need for more Life
   Cycle Assessment studies (LCA) are suggested as some of the future
   research lines.

AB Several edible and non-edible oil sources are currently being developed
   as renewable basestocks for biolubricant production. However, these
   feedstocks possess undesirable physicochemical properties limiting their
   lubricant applications. Chemical modification and additive-based routes
   could be used to modify their properties -suitable for different
   biolubricant applications. The first part of this study compares how the
   selected modifications affect the properties of the basestocks. Next,
   the techno-economic analysis (TEA) was conducted to study 4 selected
   biolubricants and a potential biolubricant derived from marine
   microalgae biomass. Oxidative stabilities of chemically modified
   biolubricants followed the order of epoxidation > triesterification >
   estolide. Pour points of triesters showed minimal increments and reduced
   for estolides, whereas epoxidation increased pour points. Estolides
   exhibit maximum kinematic viscosity increment among chemical
   modification routes, followed by TMP-transesterification and
   epoxidation. The oxidative stability of chemically modified
   biolubricants was higher than additized biolubricants; conversely, the
   viscosity increments and pour point reductions for additized
   biolubricants were higher than chemically modified biolubricants. TEA
   results show that the unit cost for producing 1-kg estolide was the
   highest among the chemical modification routes. The unit cost per
   kilogram of jatropha biolubricant produced using the additive-based
   route was lower than chemically modified biolubricants. Due to a high
   microalgal oil feedstock cost, the unit cost per kilogram of additized
   microalgae oil biolubricant was more than the unit cost of additized
   Jatropha oil. The techno-economic feasibility of biolubricant production
   from marine microalgal oil could be improved by adopting a biorefinery
   approach.

AB Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) can contribute reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions compared to conventional fuel. With the increasing SAFs
   demand, various generations of resources have been shifted from the 1st
   generation (oil crops), the 2nd generation (agricultural waste), to the
   3rd generation (microalgae). Microalgae are the most suitable feedstock
   for jet biofuel production than other resources because of their
   productivity and capability to capture carbon dioxide. However,
   microalgae-based biofuel has a limitation of high freezing point.
   Recently, a jet biofuel derived from Euglena wax ester has been paying
   attention due to its low freezing point. Challenges still remain to
   enhance production yields in both upstream and downstream processes.
   Studies on downstream processes as well as techno-economic analysis on
   biofuel production using Euglena are highly limited to date. Economic
   aspects for the biofuel production will be ensured via valorization of
   industrial byproducts such as food wastes.

AB Microalgae (MA) biorefinery is a vital platform for the conversion of
   biomass into biofuels, biomaterials, and bioactive substances and it can
   remediate the pollutant from the environment. Moreover, its
   commercialization can enable a jump start towards resolving energy and
   economic crisis. However, the major bottleneck in biorefinery includes
   (i) low biomass and biomolecules production, (ii) high cost, (iii) less
   economic viability, (iv) high energy requirement, and (v) environmental
   impacts of the process. Furthermore, the lack of advanced models or
   algorithms for process designing and limited genetic and molecular
   knowledge is a key bottleneck. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel
   integrated microalgal bioenergy conversion methods that provide economic
   and environmental balance. Moreover, advanced molecular knowledge in the
   microalgal research pipeline can be developed that improves the
   biosynthesis of biomolecules. Furthermore, novel technological
   development is required that automatically controls and monitors the
   microalgal biorefinery. Thus, the current review describes a comparative
   analysis of the gaps from previous studies. Subsequently, it highlights
   advanced cutting-edge cultivation and molecular and genetic approaches
   for enhancing biomass and biomolecules. It critically evaluates the
   potential of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and IoTs-based
   sensors used in microalgal cultivation, system optimization pipeline,
   and other aspects. Finally, it aims to provide a conceptual scenario and
   integrated mechanisms of multiple biofuel production with co-products
   formation concerning zero-carbon and waste footprint to maintain a
   circular-bioeconomy. Additionally, it also offers elaboration on recent
   life-cycle-assessment (LCA), techno-economic analysis (TEA) of recent
   microalgal biofuels biorefinery, and algal biofuels' current and future
   market trends towards sustainability key challenges and opportunities.
   This review will contribute critically to the novelty and significance
   in the field of microalgae biorefinery to develop smarter, safer,
   cleaner, greener, and economically efficient techniques for exhaustive
   energy recovery tactics and pathway to a digitalized the future of MA

AB Microalgae as a feedstock source for biofuels have been researched
   extensively over the last decade as the renewable energy community
   strives to find an environmentally responsible and economically feasible
   source of transportation fuel. This study focuses on microalgae not as a
   source of transportation fuel but as a fundamental pillar of sustainable
   rural communities seeking to achieve a net-zero energy and waste status.
   Sources of sustenance, waste streams, energy demands, energy production,
   and recycle methods are evaluated in this life cycle assessment and
   techno-economic analysis to determine if a rural community can achieve a
   state of neutrality and self-sustainability. A functional unit of 20,000
   MJ/year corresponding to the energy demand of a 902-person community is
   modeled after a town in Georgia. The model revealed that the total
   available land for algae production was 7.45 ha, but only 0.02 ha was
   required for producing 20,000 MJ/year, our functional unit in this
   study. At this magnitude of algae cultivation, the energy return on
   investment (EROI) was 0.54 (net negative energy community) and the
   profitability index was only 0.04 (community is at financial loss). When
   the algae cultivation area is increased to 1.8 ha, an EROI of 1 is
   achieved; however, PI is still <1 (0.07). In order to reach PI = 1 (the
   break-even community), the algae cultivation area must be increased to
   1.55 ha, with a corresponding EROI of 3.87. The greenhouse gas offsets
   for all communities were determined to be substantially larger than
   their emissions.

AB Photosynthetic microalgae are unicellular organisms that, during their
   cultivation, can fix carbon dioxide efficiently from various sources,
   including the air and exhaust gases from industrial processes. This
   feature can lead to economic benefits in the production process of
   biodiesel by way of the clean development mechanism, for which carbon
   credits for environmental benefits may be granted and which will
   contribute towards reducing costs in the production process. This study
   seeks to quantify the contribution of carbon credits in the operating
   costs of a route for biodiesel production from microalgae, as proposed
   by Daviset al.[Techno-economic analysis of autotrophic microalgae for
   fuel production. Appl Energy. 2011;88:3524-3531]. The results showed a
   reduction in annual operating costs by around 5%. This figure may be
   conservative, since the production process considered can be further
   improved to reduce operating costs and thus increase the contribution
   margin of carbon credits, which will reduce costs. On the other hand,
   the price of carbon may also rise in the future, thereby increasing its
   contribution towards a reduction in operating costs.

AB Commercial production and academic research on microalgae for biodiesel
   are in their infancy. This research explores the case of a sub-Saharan
   country that has limited resources (land) to produce biodiesel from
   first-generation feedstock (oilseed or animal fat) but has abundant
   availability of coastal sea areas and solar irradiation to produce
   microalgae (feedstock for third-generation biofuels). This article deals
   with the technoeconomic analysis of biodiesel production from microalgae
   in Guinea-Bissau. The Aspen Plus V12 simulator was used to model the
   flowsheet of chemical conversion processes from microalgae oil to
   biodiesel production and to widen the technoeconomic assessment.
   Simulations revealed that for a production of 5.47 m3d-1 of biodiesel
   (incorporating 3% of biodiesel into the conventional diesel), the
   estimated cost is 0.9 US$ kg-1 and the cultivated area is 1.5 * 102 ha.
   This cost is promisingly competitive with the diesel in the service
   station in Guinea-Bissau. Sensitivity analyses of predictive scenarios
   allowed us to identify significant gains in the scale of production. The
   widening of the scope of the feasibility simulations, including chemical
   processes, technological alternatives, mass and energy balance,
   environmental impacts, and productive and economic parameters, is a
   relevant contribution to the advancement of the techno-economic analysis
   of microalgae bioenergy production on a commercial scale. Although
   Guinea-Bissau has a small biodiesel demand, the scenarios are
   encouraging and may be explored as a bottom line to support the policy
   and investment decision-making processes to design a biodiesel from
   microalgae program in Guinea-Bissau and other coastal sub-Saharan
   countries.

AB Background: Microalgal triglycerides (TAGs) hold great promise as
   sustainable feedstock for commodity industries. However, to determine
   research priorities and support business decisions, solid
   techno-economic studies are essential. Here, we present a
   techno-economic analysis of two-step TAG production (growth reactors are
   operated in continuous mode such that multiple batch-operated stress
   reactors are inoculated and harvested sequentially) for a 100-ha plant
   in southern Spain using vertically stacked tubular photobioreactors. The
   base case is established with outdoor pilot-scale data and based on
   current process technology. Results: For the base case, production costs
   of 6.7 Euro per kg of biomass containing 24% TAG (w/w) were found.
   Several scenarios with reduced production costs were then presented
   based on the latest biological and technological advances. For instance,
   much effort should focus on increasing the photosynthetic efficiency
   during the stress and growth phases, as this is the most influential
   parameter on production costs (30 and 14% cost reduction from base
   case). Next, biological and technological solutions should be
   implemented for a reduction in cooling requirements (10 and 4.5% cost
   reduction from base case when active cooling is avoided and cooling
   setpoint is increased, respectively). When implementing all the
   suggested improvements, production costs can be decreased to 3.3 Euro
   per kg of biomass containing 60% TAG (w/w) within the next 8 years.
   Conclusions: With our techno-economic analysis, we indicated a roadmap
   for a substantial cost reduction. However, microalgal TAGs are not yet
   cost efficient when compared to their present market value.
   Cost-competiveness strictly relies on the valorization of the whole
   biomass components and on cheaper PBR designs (e.g. plastic film flat
   panels). In particular, further research should focus on the development
   and commercialization of PBRs where active cooling is avoided and stable
   operating temperatures are maintained by the water basin in which the
   reactor is placed.

AB Microalgae represent a promising solution in addressing the impacts
   associated with the current agricultural and manufacturing practices
   which are causing irreparable environmental damage. Microalgae have
   considerable biosynthetic potential, being a rich source of lipids,
   proteins, and high-value compounds. Under the scope of the H2020-BBI
   MULTI-STR3AM project, an innovative large-scale production system of
   valuable commodities for the food, feed, and fragrance sectors is being
   developed on the basis of microalgae, reducing costs, increasing the
   scale of production, and boosting value chain sustainability. In this
   work, we aimed to create a process model that can mimic an industrial
   plant to estimate mass and energy balances, optimize scheduling, and
   calculate production costs for a large-scale plant. Three autotrophic
   microalgae strains (Nannochloropsissp.,Dunaliellasp. and Spirulina sp.)
   were considered for this assessment, as well as the use of locally
   sourced CO2(flue gas). The developed process model is a useful tool for
   obtaining the data required for techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life
   cycle assessment (LCA) of industrial biorefinery-based
   processes.Nannochloropsissp. was the most economic option,
   whereasDunaliellasp. was the most expensive strain to produce due to its
   lower productivity. Preliminary environmental assessments of the climate
   change impact category revealed that water recirculation and the use of
   flue gas could lead to values of 5.6, 10.6, and 9.2
   kgCO2eq.kgAFDW-1forNannochloropsissp.,Dunaliellasp., and Spirulina sp.,
   respectively, with electricity and NaCl as the main contributors. The
   obtained data allow for the quantification of the production costs and
   environmental impacts of the microalgal biomass fractions produced,
   which will be fundamental for future comparison studies and in
   determining if they are higher or lower than those of the replaced
   products. The process model developed in this work provides a useful
   tool for the evaluation and optimization of large-scale microalgae
   production systems.

AB Biofuel production from microalgae biomass has been considered a viable
   alternative to harmful fossil fuels; however, challenges are faced
   regarding its economic sustainability. Process integration to yield
   various high-value bioproducts is implemented to raise profitability and
   sustainability. By incorporating a circular economy outlook,
   recirculation of resource flows is maximized to yield economic and
   environmental benefits through waste minimization. However, previous
   modeling studies have not looked into the opportunity of integrating
   productivity reduction related to the continuous recirculation and reuse
   of resources until it reaches its end of life. In this work, a novel
   multi-objective optimization model is developed centered on an algal
   biorefinery that simultaneously optimizes cost and environmental impact,
   adopts the principle of resource recovery and recirculation, and
   incorporates the life cycle assessment methodology to properly account
   for the environmental impacts of the system. An algal biorefinery
   involving end-products such as biodiesel, glycerol, biochar, and
   fertilizer was used for a case study to validate the optimization model.
   The generated optimal results are assessed and further analyzed through
   scenario analysis. It was seen that demand fluctuations and process unit
   efficiencies have significant effect on the optimal results.

AB Poultry livestock profitability significantly depends on feed,
   accounting for 60-70% of the total production cost, of which protein
   sources are among of the most expensive ingredients. The maintenance of
   profitability while meeting feed demand and reducing the environmental
   impact represents a considerable challenge driving research of
   alternative protein sources (APS), such as insects and algae meals. This
   study employs, for the first time, techno-economic assessment (TEA)
   methodology to evaluate the technological performance and the industrial
   feasibility of an APS-based poultry feed production method based on the
   valorization of the pre-treated organic fraction of municipal solid
   waste (OFMSW) as a substrate forHermetia illucenslarval growth and
   microalgae cultivation. The Excel-based analysis, which evaluated the
   mass and energy balance as well as the income statement, was integrated
   with a thematic analysis focused on exploring how the overall value
   attributed to the sustainability concept is reflected in the willingness
   to adopt sustainable business models by entrepreneurs in the poultry
   sector. Despite the ability to generate revenues, the model cannot be
   said to be profitable for animal feed production due to the strong
   dependence of its profitability on scale economy logics. Enabling
   solutions could be derived from the recovery of abandoned
   infrastructures, government financial incentives, and integrated systems
   associating OFMSW treatment with poultry farming, thus resulting in
   marked economic sustainability and profitability: key elements from the
   poultry entrepreneurs' point of view.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising process for conversion of algae
   to bio-oil that is especially suitable for the high moisture content of
   algal feedstock. A two-stage sequential hydrothermal liquefaction
   (SEQHTL) alternative was developed to facilitate production of
   co-products in addition to bio-oil at reduced temperatures and pressures
   compared with conventional one-stage direct hydrothermal liquefaction
   (DHTL). In this study, Aspen simulation and comprehensive
   techno-economic analysis were conducted for both SEQHTL and DHTL
   processes to assess their performance when used to convert the same
   algal strain (Chlorella sorokiniana) to bio-oil intermediates. The
   technical and economic evaluation also included the subsequent upgrading
   of the bio-crude to biofuels via hydrotreatment. The minimum fuel
   selling price for SEQHTL and DHTL was $1.61/L, and $2.10/L,
   respectively. The milder operating conditions of SEQHTL process resulted
   in both reduced capital and operating cost. The total installed cost of
   the facilities for hydrothermal processing 1215 metric tons/day of algae
   was $89 million for SEQHTL and $112 million for DHTL. A higher energy
   returned on energy invested was realized by SEQHTL (6.73) owing to its
   greater amount of fuel blendstock produced and less energy required for
   production in comparison with DHTL (5.31). The sensitivity analysis
   showed that improving the yield and quality of both the bio-oil and
   co-products, as well as increasing the feed concentration, may lead to a
   much lower production cost. This study provided new insights of
   hydrothermal liquefaction process design with highlighting the potential
   of recycling of nutrient streams and fractionation algal biomass at
   milder operating conditions.

   performed to calculate the mass and energy analysis of the whole process
   for the production of hydrocarbons such as diesel, jet, gasoline, and

   selling price (MSP) of the hydrocarbon fuels. The MSP of the hydrocarbon
   fuels is found at US$4.3/GGE. This value is comparable with the
   previously reported value in the literature. In addition, the

AB After obtaining of biogas during the anaerobic digestion processes, the
   liquid fraction can be applied directly as fertilizer (if it meets the
   relevant sanitary and hygienic norms), or the rich in mineral
   composition digestate to be used as a medium for development of
   microalgae. The algal biomass thus obtained could be applied as
   fertilizer, and the unused part of it could be re-utilized as raw
   material in other methanation processes, alone or in combination with
   other raw materials or wastes. Microalgae can easily colonize different
   environments. These microorganisms represent promising sources for new
   products and applications. The obtained liquid phase of anaerobic
   digestate was utilized as medium for enhanced growth of green
   microalgae. The ability of microalgae to photosynthetically fix carbon
   dioxide with production of valuable substances, their short growth cycle
   and easy biomass accummulation was used. In this study, good growth and
   development was observed forthe microalga Scenedesmus obliquus in
   digestate after a clarification process, based on the macro and

AB Microalgae have various advantages over vegetable crops, such as their
   growth speed, the greater consumption of CO2 and production of O2, and
   the vast variety of products where they can be used. For this reason,
   the present work seeks to quantify the trends that exist in microalgae
   research, by running related keywords in Scopus databases in a span of
   ten years. The central words used were related to biorefineries,
   microalgae, products and simulation. Likewise, the Wizdom.ai platform
   and VosViewer data analysis software were used. It was found that
   between 2015 and 2019, publications increased around 74 and 89%. The
   graphical and statistical analysis through VosViewer allowed identifying
   the relationship between biorefinery and microalgae. Which showed that
   there is a trend in publications on the topic of biofuels, and that
   there is still little information corresponding to the biorefinery
   concept related to the analysis between microalgae and process
   simulation. Based on a global analysis of the abstracts of most of the
   publications, the main difficulties and information gaps in the
   processes under the biorefinery concept were identified, especially
   relating processes, costs, circular economy and environmental aspects.

AB Background: Microalgae possess numerous advantages for use as a
   feedstock in producing renewable fuels and products, with
   techno-economic analysis (TEA) frequently used to highlight the economic
   potential and technical challenges of utilizing this biomass in a
   biorefinery context. However, many historical TEA studies have focused
   on the conversion of biomass with elevated levels of carbohydrates and
   lipids and lower levels of protein, incurring substantial burdens on the
   ability to achieve high cultivation productivity rates relative to
   nutrient-replete, high-protein biomass. Given a strong dependence of
   algal biomass production costs on cultivation productivity, further TEA
   assessment is needed to understand the economic potential for utilizing
   potentially lower-cost but lower-quality, high-protein microalgae for
   biorefinery conversion. Results: In this work, we conduct rigorous TEA
   modeling to assess the economic viability of two conceptual technology
   pathways for processing proteinaceous algae into a suite of fuels and
   products. One approach, termed mild oxidative treatment and upgrading
   (MOTU), makes use of a series of thermo-catalytic operations to upgrade
   solubilized proteins and carbohydrates to hydrocarbon fuels, while
   another alternative focuses on the biological conversion of those
   substrates to oxygenated fuels in the form of mixed alcohols (MA). Both
   pathways rely on the production of polyurethanes from unsaturated fatty
   acids and valorization of unconverted solids for use as a material for
   synthesizing bioplastics. The assessment found similar, albeit slightly
   higher fuel yields and lower costs for the MA pathway, translating to a
   residual solids selling price of $899/ton for MA versus $1033/ton for
   MOTU as would be required to support a $2.50/gallon gasoline equivalent
   (GGE) fuel selling price. A variation of the MA pathway including
   subsequent upgrading of the mixed alcohols to hydrocarbon fuels (MAU)
   reflected a required solids selling price of $975/ton. Conclusion: The
   slight advantages observed for the MA pathway are partially attributed
   to a boundary that stops at oxygenated fuels versus fungible drop-in
   hydrocarbon fuels through a more complex MOTU configuration, with more
   comparable results obtained for the MAU scenario. In either case, it was
   shown that an integrated algal biorefinery can be economical through
   optimal strategies to utilize and valorize all fractions of the biomass.

AB Integration of Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass
   with concentrated solar power thermal processing (CSP) for bio-oil
   production is a potential processing pathway for energy efficient
   generation of renewable biofuels. Solar HTL infrastructure avoids
   additional bolt-on components of conventional solar parabolic trough
   systems used for electricity production including heat transfer fluids,
   counter current heat exchangers, fluid transfer interconnectivity and
   electrical power control systems. The absence of such capital intensive
   additional equipment considerably reduces the production costs of solar
   HTL biofuels compared to electricity generation from conventional CSP
   power systems. An economic and market appraisal of variance and system
   economic resilience is presented. It is hypothesised that the
   combination of nutrient recycling with HTL/CSP unification has the
   potential for economically sustainable microalgae bio-oil production. A
   microalgae biofuel minimum fuel sales price of $1.23/kg has been
   modelled. Further experimental work would be able to validate this
   integrated model.

AB The commercialization of biofuels produced from microalgae is in its
   infancy; therefore, many resource-management practices and production
   processes are still flexible. The purpose of this paper is to guide
   development of supply chains toward more environmentally sustainable
   practices. We review current and projected technologies and practices
   for autotrophic microalgae cultivation that promote environmental
   sustainability. We develop a framework that leverages these studies to
   propose better management practices (BMPs) for water quality and
   quantity, biodiversity, or greenhouse gas emissions in concert with
   productivity and profitability considerations. Some proposed BMPs are
   linked to numerical environmental targets, such as percent reductions in
   nutrient loadings to streams, whereas others seek to avoid thresholds
   leading to adverse health or ecological effects. Still others involve
   using the best available technologies, developed iteratively through
   life-cycle and techno-economic analyses. Proposed BMPs for microalgae
   cultivation focus on water quality and quantity, as well as improving
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to obtain advanced biofuel designation.
   BMPs must allow producers to meet productivity and profitability
   targets, as well as environmental targets. These example BMPs
   characterize the state of science and engineering; thus, they will
   change over time.

AB In recent years, microalgal biomass cultivation has been growing in
   importance, not only related to the production of alternative foods and
   nutritional supplements but also for its usage for energy purposes or as
   a natural solution for wastewater treatment. Regarding these cases, the
   practical potential associated with the circular economy is evident.
   However, this is not an option for microalgal food and supplements due
   to strict hygiene requirements for microalgae cultivation used for these
   purposes. Currently, the most common cultivation options for microalgae
   include phototrophic cascades, photobioreactors, and heterotrophic
   fermenters. Generally, the higher requirements for the purity of the
   resulting biomass, the higher the consumption of energy and nutrients
   needed. These are the main operational parameters that significantly
   shape the total environmental and economic performance of microalgae
   cultivation processes. The comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of
   environmental aspects in the operational phases of three selected
   cultivation systems, located in the Czech Republic and used for pure
   microalgae biomass production, confirmed that the impacts of these
   systems in the assessed categories are fundamentally dependent on the
   amount of electricity needed and nutrient consumption, as well as their
   sources. For this reason, the heterotrophic fermenter was evaluated as
   being the most damaging in the comparison of the three cultivation
   systems, while the phototrophic cascade showed a lower total
   environmental impact by 15% and the flat photobioreactor was lower
   still, by 95%, mainly due to energy production from biomass. The major
   impact categories observed were climate change, depletion of fossil
   fuels, human toxicity, and freshwater and marine ecotoxicity. The
   environmental impacts of microalgae cultivation systems could be further
   reduced if cycling practices, such as process water recycling and
   reprocessing of generated sewage sludge, were addressed.

AB Over the past decades, interest in microalgae has grown exponentially.
   Especially industrial applications, such as biodiesel production from
   microalgae were hyped in the early 2000s. But since the first attempts
   to commercialise microalgae-derived products for energy applications,
   only a few developments made it to the market. What is hindering the
   full exploitation of this valuable resource for food, feed, and energy
   applications? This opinion paper reflects on the state of the art of
   industrial microalgae culturing and the knowledge gaps which still need
   to be filled jointly by academia and industry.

AB Microalgae, highly prized for their protein, lipid, carbohydrate,
   phycocyanin, and carotenoid-rich biomass, have garnered significant
   industrial attention in the context of third-generation (3G)
   biorefineries, seeking sustainable alternatives to non-renewable
   resources. Two primarily cultivation methods, open ponds and closed
   photobioreactors systems, have emerged. Open ponds, favored for their
   cost-effectiveness in large-scale industrial production, although
   lacking precise environmental control, contrast with closed
   photobioreactors, offering controlled conditions and enhanced biomass
   production at the laboratory scale. However, their high operational
   costs challenge large-scale deployment. This review comprehensively
   examines the strength, weakness, and typical designs of both outdoor and
   indoor microalgae cultivation systems, with an emphasis on their
   application in terms of biorefinery concept. Additionally, it
   incorporates techno-economic analyses, providing insights into the
   financial aspects of microalgae biomass production. These multifaceted
   insights, encompassing both technological and economic dimensions, are
   important as the global interest in harnessing microalgae's valuable
   resources continue to grow.

AB The fuels retrieved from renewable sources which are usually employed as
   both carbon and energy sources are termed as neutral based biofuels. The
   most promising feedstock from renewable sources with great potentiality
   in contributing to the inclining energy demand is microalgae. These
   microalgae can be harnessed readily in terms of obtaining qualitative
   biodiesel with greater energy consumption under limited operational
   cost. The process of harvesting or dewatering microalgae could be
   carried under single or sequential combinations of operations. The major
   drawback of harvesting such as huge operational cost could be lowered by
   increasing the level of automation than cost of investments. The present
   review concentrates and explores on the techno-economic analysis of the
   microalgal harvesting and dewatering processes on a large scale. Along
   with these advanced techniques enclosing the utilization of
   nanoparticles for harvesting has also been explored. And it also adds
   with the impacts of concerning facts on energy consumption, processing
   cost and recovery of resources during harvesting.

AB The effect of bubble size and rise velocity on the efficiency of a foam
   flotation microalgae harvesting unit was determined. Three sparger and
   input airflow combinations were used: (1) limewood sparger with constant
   airflow, (2) ceramic flat plate sparger with constant airflow and (3)
   ceramic flat plate sparger with an oscillating airflow. The ceramic
   sparger with oscillating flow generated the smallest bubbles within the
   liquid pool and the largest bubbles within the foam phase. This
   delivered the highest levels of biomass recovery due to enhanced
   bubble-algae collision and attachment efficiencies. The smaller bubbles
   generated by the ceramic sparger under constant or oscillating airflow
   had significantly faster rise velocities when compared to the larger
   bubbles produced by the limewood spargers. The faster velocities of the
   smaller bubbles were due to momentum transfer to the liquid phase.
   Analyses of the harvest economics revealed that the ceramic flat plate
   sparger with an oscillating airflow delivered the best overall
   cost-benefit relationship.

AB The hydrochar, a by-product of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algal
   biomass, was utilized through two methods; combustion and activation,
   for its usage as a source of heat and a catalyst support for
   hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process in the production of algal biofuels. In
   this study, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment
   (LCA) of algal biofuels production in a two-stage process (HTL and HDO)
   were investigated. Aspen plus simulation and SimaPro software were used
   to analyze process economics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   Microalgae at 200 dry metric tonnes day-1was the basis for its
   conversion to biocrude oil through HTL in the methanol-water system
   followed by catalytic upgrading to produce biofuels. According to HTL
   experimental results, maximum biocrude oil yield of 57.8 wt% was
   obtained using microalgae-solvent mass ratio and methanol-water mass
   ratio of 1:5 and 3:1, respectively. Produced biocrude oil contained 14.5
   wt% of oxygen and HHV of 33.4 MJ kgbiocrude oil-1which required
   upgrading to be utilized as a transportation fuel. HDO was employed to
   enhance the quality of biocrude oil with decrease in oxygen content (3.1
   wt%) and increase in HHV (42 MJ kgbiofuel-1). The minimum fuel selling
   price (MFSP) for using method #2 (activation) was 2.2 $ L-1to breakeven
   the cost of operation, which was about 10% lower than that from method
   #1 (combustion). The GHG emissions performance was estimated at -1.13
   gCO2-eqMJ-1indicating the significant GHG emissions reduction compared
   to petroleum-based fuels production.

AB The accumulation of a large amount of organic solid waste and the lack
   of sufficient protein supply worldwide are two major challenges caused
   by rapid population growth. Anaerobic digestion is the main force of
   organic waste treatment, and the high-value utilization of its products
   (biogas and digestate) has been widely concerned. These products can be
   used as nutrients and energy sources for microorganisms such as
   microalgae, yeast, methane-oxidizing bacteria(MOB), and
   hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria(HOB) to produce single cell protein(SCP),
   which contributes to the achievement of sustainable development goals.
   This new model of energy conversion can construct a bioeconomic cycle
   from waste to nutritional products, which treats waste without
   additional carbon emissions and can harvest high-value biomass.
   Techno-economic analysis shows that the SCP from biogas and digestate
   has higher profit than biogas electricity generation, and its production
   cost is lower than the SCP using special raw materials as the substrate.
   In this review, the case of SCP-rich microorganisms using anaerobic
   digestion products for growth was investigated. Some of the challenges
   faced by the process and the latest developments were analyzed, and
   their potential economic and environmental value was verified.

AB Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) that can be derived from food wastes were
   used for microbial lipid production by Chlorella protothecoides in
   heterotrophic cultures. The usage of VFAs as carbon sources for lipid
   accumulation was investigated in batch cultures. Culture medium, culture
   temperature, and nitrogen sources were explored for lipid production in
   the heterotrophic cultivation. The concentration and the ratio of VFAs
   exhibited significant influence on cell growth and lipid accumulation.
   The highest lipid yield coefficient and lipid content of C.
   protothecoides grown on VFAs were 0.187 g/g and 48.7%, respectively. The
   lipid content and fatty acids produced using VFAs as carbon sources were
   similar to those seen on growth and production using glucose. The
   techno-economic analysis indicates that the biodiesel derived from the
   lipids produced by heterotrophic C. protothecoides with VFAs as carbon
   sources is very promising and competitive with other biofuels and fossil
   fuels.

AB Microalgae is a renewable bioresource with the potential to replace the
   conventional fossil-based industrial production of organic chemicals and
   pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the microalgal biomass contains carotenoids,
   vitamins, and other biomolecules that are widely used as food
   supplements. However, the microalgal biomass production, their
   composition variations, energy-intensive harvesting methods, optimized
   bio-refinery routes, and lack of techno-economic analysis are the major
   bottleneck for the life-sized commercialization of this nascent
   bio-industry. This review discusses the microalgae-derived key bioactive
   compounds and their applications in different sectors for human health.
   Furthermore, this review proposes advanced strategies to enhance the
   productivity of bioactive compounds and highlight the key challenges
   associated with a safety issue for use of microalgae biomass. It also
   provides a detailed global scenario and market demand of microalgal
   bioproducts. In conclusion, this review will provide the concept of
   microalgal biorefinery to produce bioactive compounds at industrial
   scale platform for their application in the nutraceutical and
   pharmaceutical sector considering their current and future market
   trends.

U2 18
AB The voluminous nature of palm oil mill effluent (POME) is directly
   associated with environmental hazards and could be turned into
   biorefinery products. The POME, rich in BOD, COD, and oil and grease,
   with few hazardous materials such as siloxanes, fatty acid methyl ester,
   and phenolic compounds that may significantly increase the risk of
   violating the effluent quality standards. Recently, the application of
   chemical and biological risk assessment that can use electrochemical
   sensors and microalgae-like species has gained paramount attention
   towards its remediation. This review describes the existing risk
   assessment for POME and recommends a novel assessment approach using
   fish species including invasive ones as suitable for identifying the
   toxicants. Various physico-chemical and biological treatments such as
   adsorption, coagulation-flocculation, photo-oxidation, solar-assisted
   extraction, anaerobic digestion, integrated anaerobic-aerobic, and
   microalgae cultivation has been investigated. This paper offers an
   overview of anaerobic technologies, with particular emphasis on advanced
   bioreactors and their prospects for industrial-level applications. To
   illustrate, palmitic acid and oleic acid, the precursors of fatty acid
   methyl ester found in POME pave the way to produce biodiesel with
   91.45%. Although there are some challenges in attaining production at an
   economic scale, this review offers some opportunities that could help in
   overcoming these challenges.

U2 48
AB An integrated process for the co-production of cellulosic ethanol and
   microalgal biomass by fixing CO2generated from bioethanol fermentation
   is proposed. Specifically, over one-fifth of the fermentative carbon was
   converted into high-purity CO2during ethanol production. The optimal
   concentration of 4% CO2was identified for the growth and metabolism
   ofChlorellasp. BWY-1. A multiple short-term intermittent CO2supply
   system was established to efficiently fix and recycle the waste CO2.
   Using this system, economical co-production of cellulosic ethanol
   byZymomonas mobilisand microalgal biomass in biogas slurry wastewater
   was achieved, resulting in the production of ethanol at a rate of 0.4
   g/L/h and a fixed fermentation CO2of 3.1 g/L/d. Moreover, the amounts of
   algal biomass and chlorophyllaincreased by over 50% and two-fold,
   respectively. Through techno-economic analysis, the integrated process
   demonstrated its cost-effectiveness for cellulosic ethanol production.
   This study presents an innovative approach to a low-carbon circular
   bioeconomy.

AB A bioprospecting study was conducted from Seawater samples collected at
   Kaohsiung Seacoast, Taiwan. The current research was aimed to isolate
   potential lutein-producing strain, evaluate and optimize the best
   cultivation mode, lutein accumulation stage, lutein-extraction method,
   and condition to recover maximum lutein (main product) and lipid
   (byproduct). Biorefinery is the latest approach worldwide to extract
   multi-products for cost-effectiveness. Selected isolate among several
   isolates, identified asChlorella sorokinianaKh12 and exploited under
   biorefinery concept for lutein and lipid extraction. Kh12 cultivated
   under mixotrophy: 2X-(HT)-9k yielded maximum biomass (3.46 g L-1) and
   lutein (13.69 mg g-1) which is among the higher yields reported so far.
   Among various tested solvents, methanol was the best extractor. Bead
   milling was most effective to disrupt algal cell walls, seven minutes of
   milling was best for maximum lutein (7.56 mg g-1) extraction. Kh12 could
   be a promising candidate for commercial lutein and lipid co-production
   based on the outcome.

U2 41
AB The screening and evaluation of co-control technologies for pollution
   reduction and carbon mitigation represent a crucial prerequisite for
   researching pathways toward pollution and carbon reduction within
   petroleum refining industry. A systematic assessment method for
   technology synergies in pollution reduction and carbon mitigation
   remains deficient in China. In this study, we propose a method for
   evaluating the synergistic effects of technologies in pollution
   reduction and carbon mitigation in the petroleum refining industry. This
   model evaluates the synergistic control efficacy of technologies from
   multiple perspectives, including pollution-carbon synergy, synergistic
   reduction of pollutant-carbon emissions, cost-benefit analysis, and
   environmental benefits. The developed methodology is validated through
   its application to typical petroleum refining technology. The results
   confirm the synergistic benefits of pollution and carbon reduction
   through five petroleum refining technologies. With the increase in
   carbon trading prices, bio-jet fuels (T1) and microalgae carbon
   sequestration (T5) technologies have greater application potential. This
   study provides a scientific basis and theoretical support for the
   realization of collaborative control of carbon pollution in the
   petroleum refining industry.

   biomasses were produced from cultivation in open raceway ponds in
   nutrient regimes with the availability and limitation of nitrogen and
   phosphorus. The methods used in this study were life cycle assessment
   (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA). The largest contribution in
   the Processing stage was from the microalgae biomass production, which
   accounted for 43-91% of the indicator values in the base scenarios. The
   production of bioproducts from microalgae cultivation in scenarios of
   nutrient limitation, higher biomass productivity, electricity supply
   from a photovoltaic plant, and nutrient supply from on-site residual
   sources combined reduced up to 61% in energy demand, 79% in carbon
   footprint, and 47% in financial cost compared to those of the base
   scenarios. Biomass powder is a competitive input for substituting
   fossil-based materials in plastic composites. Even though the biomass
   composition change from microalgae cultivation in nutrient limitation,
   methane loss reduction, and multiproduct coproduction favored the
   viability of anaerobic digestion in the assessed categories, the
   financial cost of biogas production must be reduced to increase its
   competitiveness compared to fossil fuels. Therefore, the proposed
   strategies in the evaluated scenarios should be combined to increase the
   eco-efficiency in an integrated microalgae biorefinery.

AB Global demand for plastic materials has severely harm the environment
   and marine sea life. Therefore, bioplastics have emerged as an
   environmentally friendly alternative due to sustainability, minimal
   carbon footprint, less toxicity and high degradability. This review
   highlights the sustainable and environmentally friendly approach towards
   bioplastic production by utilizing microalgae as a feed source in
   several ways. First, the microalgae biomass obtained through the
   biorefinery approach can be processed into PHA under certain nutrient
   limitations. Additionally, microalgae biomass can act as potential
   filler and reinforcement towards the enhancement of bioplastic either
   blending with conventional bioplastic or synthetic polymer. The
   downstream processing of microalgae via suitable extraction and
   pre-treatment of bioactive compounds such as lipids and cellulose are
   found to be promising for the production of bioplastics. Moving on, the
   intermediate processing of bioplastic via lactic acid synthesized from
   microalgae has favoured the microwave-assisted synthesis of polylactic
   acid due to cost efficiency, minimum solvent usage, low energy
   consumption, and fast rate of reaction. Moreover, the reliability and
   effectiveness of microalgae-based bioplastics are further evaluated in
   terms of techno-economic analysis and degradation mechanism. Future
   improvement and recommendations are listed towards proper genetic
   modification of algae strains, large-scale biofilm technology, low-cost
   cultivation medium, and novel avocado seed-microalgae bioplastic blend.

AB Phycoremediation is gaining attention not only as a pollutant mitigation
   approach but also as one of the most cost-effective paths to achieve
   carbon neutrality. When compared to conventional treatment methods,
   phycoremediation is highly effective in removing noxious substances from
   wastewater and is inexpensive, eco-friendly, abundantly available, and
   has many other advantages. The process results in valuable bioproducts
   and bioenergy sources combined with pollutants capture, sequestration,
   and utilization. In this review, microalgae-based phycoremediation of
   various wastewaters for carbon neutrality and circular economy is
   analyzed scientometrically. Different mechanisms for pollutants removal
   and resource recovery from wastewaters are explained. Further, critical
   parameters that influence the engineering design and phycoremediation
   performance are described. A comprehensive knowledge map highlighting
   the microalgae potential to treat a variety of industrial effluents is
   also presented. Finally, challenges and future prospects for industrial
   implementation of phycoremediation towards carbon neutrality coupled
   with circular economy are discussed.

U1 15
U2 15
AB The aquaculture industry urgently requires sustainable protein sources
   to address the environmental, economic, and ethical challenges of
   conventional fishmeal. Rising feed costs, particularly for protein-rich
   ingredients, highlight the need for cost-effective, high-quality, and
   resource-efficient alternatives. Insect-based feeds, such as black
   soldier fly (BSF) larvae, and microalgae have emerged as promising
   solutions. BSF larvae provide protein, lipids, and minerals, offering
   significant cost savings and enhanced growth in aquaculture species.
   Similarly, microalgae, rich in essential amino acids, lipids, vitamins,
   and pigments, supports digestibility and aquaculture sustainability
   while lowering production costs and environmental impacts. Microalgae
   biorefineries further promote a circular economy by maximizing resource
   utilization and minimizing waste. This review examines the potential of
   insect-based and microalgae feeds as sustainable alternatives to
   fishmeal, addressing their advantages and challenges. It emphasizes
   their role in enhancing aquaculture production, improving resource
   efficiency, and contributing to global food security.

AB With the rise in global population, industrialization, and economic
   expansion, the persistent overconsumption of conventional fossil fuels
   has resulted in the depletion of fossil fuel reserves. This has fuelled
   the need to investigate and boost scientific research efforts on
   sustainable and renewable bioenergy feedstock. A substitute that can
   minimize reliance on nonrenewable energy resources while also lowering
   greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, biofuels have received a
   great deal of interest in recent years as a prospective substitute for
   conventional fossil fuels. The prime reason behind this is the feedstock
   utilized in their synthesis. The feedstocks employed here are
   environmentally safe, nontoxic, and emit little to no pollution. These
   feedstocks are classified into four generations: first, second, third,
   and fourth. Food crops and lignocellulosic biomass and waste constitute
   first- and second-generation feedstocks. The third- and
   fourth-generation feedstock is microalgae. This paper provides a
   comprehensive overview of feedstocks utilized to produce biofuels,
   including the various pre-treatment methods, strategies, and
   techno-economic analysis in order to pave the way for next-generation
   biofuels. It also covers the advantages, drawbacks, challenges, and
   current developments.

AB Some studies have described the use of phytohormones in microalgal
   culture for the production of biodiesel or selected fatty acids.
   However, no study has determined the amount of phytohormones that
   maximizes lipid yield. We determined the optimal concentration of auxins
   and gibberellins (which is between 40 and 60 M) in two strains
   (Scenedemus abundansandChlorella ellipsoidea) suitable for biodiesel
   production. More than 3-fold increment was reached withS. abundansand
   near 7-fold increment withC. ellipsoidea. Furthermore, this work
   suggests that the improved growth of the microalgae in the presence of
   the phytohormones was due to a reduction in the level of reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) in the cells. An economic analysis showed that, due to its
   low cost, auxin offers a positive cost-benefit balance and therefore
   could be used at large scale.

TI Transition from synthetic to alternative media for microalgae
   cultivation: a critical review.
SO Science of the Total Environment
VL 897

U1 7
U2 36
AB In recent decades, microalgae have drawn attention as a most feasible
   alternative and sustainable feedstock for biofuel production. However,
   laboratory-scale and pilot-scale studies revealed that producing only
   biofuels through the microalgal route is economically unfeasible. The
   high cost of synthetic media is one concern, and low-cost alternative
   cultivation media would replace synthetic media to culture microalgae
   for economic benefit. This paper critically consolidated the advantages
   of alternative media over synthetic media for microalgae cultivation. A
   comparative analysis of the compositions of synthetic and alternative
   media was made to evaluate the potential use of alternative media in
   microalgae cultivation. Investigations on microalgae cultivation using
   alternative media derived from different waste materials, such as
   domestic, farm, agricultural, industrial, etc., are highlighted.
   Vermiwash is another alternative media that contains essential micro and
   macronutrients required for the cultivation of microalgae. Two prime
   techniques, such as mix-waste culture media and recycling culture media,
   may provide more economic benefit for the large-scale production of
   microalgae.

AB Biohydrogen from microalgae has attracted extensive attention owing to
   its promising features of abundance, renewable and self sustainability.
   Unlike other well-established biofuels like biodiesel and bioethanol,
   biohydrogen from microalgae is still in the preliminary stage of
   development. Criticisms in microalgal biohydrogen centered on its
   practicality and sustainability. Various laboratory- and pilot-scale
   microalgal systems have been developed, and some research initiatives
   have exhibited potential for commercial application. This work provides
   a review of the state of the art of biohydrogen from microalgae.
   Discussions include metabolic pathways of light-driven transformation
   and dark fermentation, reactor schemes and system designs encompassing
   reactor configurations and light manipulation. Challenges, knowledge
   gaps and the future directions in metabolic limitations, economic and
   energy assessments, and molecular engineering are also delineated.
   Current scientific and engineering challenges of microalgal biohydrogen
   need to be addressed for technology leapfrog or breakthrough.

AB Algal bioremediation becoming most fascinating to produce biomass as
   biofuels feedstock while remediating wastes, also improving
   carbon-footprint through carbon capturing and utilization (CCU)
   technology. Non-algae process however offers effective treatment but
   metabolic CO2 emission is major drawback towards sustainable bioprocess.
   Mixotrophic cultivation strategy (MCS) enables to treat organic and
   inorganic wastes which broadly extend microalgae application towards
   cleaner and sustainable bioeconomy. Latest focus of global think-tanks
   to encourage bioprocess holding promise of sustainability via CCU
   ability as important trait. Several high CO2 emitting industries forced
   to improve their carbon-footprints. MCS driven microalgae treatment
   could be best solution for those industries. This review covers recent
   updates on MCS applications for waste-to-value (biofuels) and
   environment remediation. Moreover, recommendations to fill knowledge
   gaps, and commercial algal biofuel could be cost-effectiveness and
   sustainable technology for biocircular economy if fuelled by waste
   streams from other industries.

AB The high energy consumption in Iran, particularly in the transportation
   sector, has contaminated large cities and jeopardized the society
   health. Therefore, in this study technical and economic features of the
   production of biodiesel plant in Iran from various wastes are
   investigated. Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method's
   findings, the southern area of Iran is selected for establishing the
   biodiesel plant in Iran. The biorefinery, which includes three units of
   sewage sludge, edible waste oil and microalgae. The results of the
   economic evaluation show that the lowest costs of investment and
   production of biodiesel are related to microalgae units ($0.375/kg) and
   edible waste oil ($0.53/kg), respectively. Also, among all units, the
   lowest break even prices are related to biodiesel production ($1.17/kg)
   and the highest ATROR rate (29.16%) belongs to the microalgae unit. This
   indicates that this unit is more profitable than other units and the
   invested cost is returned to the investor in a shorter period of time
   (3.43 years). On the other hand, the results of sensitivity analysis
   show that the highest sensitivity of changes in the selling price of
   biodiesel and the cost of raw materials to ATROR to the microalgae and
   sludge unit. Therefore, the construction of a biorefinery in Iran has an
   economic justification.

AB The two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) is gaining popularity because of
   the process stability and possibility of recovering multiple-resources
   such as biohydrogen and organic acids from the first stage dark
   fermentation (DF) and methane in the AD as the second stage while
   treating the organic waste. As the performance of two-stage processes is
   influenced by the type of substrate and operational conditions, there
   have been several experiments at laboratory and pilot scales to
   determine the optimum conditions. The main objective of this review is
   to provide an updated overview of advancements in biohythane and organic
   acids production from food waste (FW) in the two-stage DF-AD process.
   Likewise, this work also provides an insight into the economic and
   future prospective of utilizing organic acids for different biochemicals
   such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, polylactate, and microalgal biomass
   production. The integration of optimum operational parameters,
   pretreatment methods, types of bioreactors is essential in combined
   DF-AD processes. The parameters and reactor configuration have to be
   optimized depending upon the targeted end-products. More research into
   the techno-economic analysis of different bioreactor configurations for
   long-term operations in an integrated DF-AD process with FW as a
   feedstock is needed to realize its viability for commercial application.

SO Journal of Cleaner Production

PY 2023
U1 4
U2 10
AB Finding a low-cost, simple technology for producing high-quality
   bioenergy (e.g., biohythane: bioH2and bioCH4) from waste biomass is
   challenging. Production of cleaner energy, such as biohythane, than
   methane from microalgae (MA), is a suitable approach. However, having a
   low C-N ratio of microalgae limits scaling up the process. Therefore,
   this study took the opportunity to use fecal sludge (FS) as a
   co-substrate for C-N ratio optimization to improve biohythane production
   while reducing cost. The biomass hydrothermal pretreatment enhanced
   soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) from 390 mgL-1to 1085 mgL-1,
   resulting volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation rate of 1853 mgL-1at a
   mixing ratio of 50:50. The results of two-stage anaerobic digestion
   (TSAD) of 50-50 MA-FS showed a cumulative biohydrogen yield of 24.5
   mLg-1-VS (Volatile Solid) and biomethane yield of 281 mLg-1-VS with a
   synergetic effect of 52.7%. The techno-economic analysis suggests a
   return on investment (ROI) of 4.8 for utilizing a 50-50 biomass ratio.
   In addition, the input cost could be reduced to 75.6% if the ratio of MA
   and FS was adjusted to 25-75. Therefore, the TSAD of MA and FS is a
   promising option to enhance the biohythane yield and its high economic
   potential.

AB As an effort to develop affordable and sustainable energy sources,
   algae-derived biofuels have attracted considerable interest. As use of
   individual conversion processes targeting a subset of biochemical
   components (e.g., extraction and upgrading of lipids) has been shown to
   be economically unfeasible, there is a recognized need for integrated
   conversion systems that can valorize algal feedstocks with varying cell
   compositions. In this study, two hybrid systems (HBD-1, HBD-2) are
   proposed to enable more efficient conversion of all biomass components
   (lipids, proteins, carbohydrates) by leveraging two complementary
   systems: direct hydrothermal liquefaction (DHTL) and combined algal
   processing (CAP). Demonstrative experiments withScenedesmus acutusshow a
   12.2-34.3% increase in fuel yields relative to individual systems (DHTL,
   CAP). Subsequent modeling efforts reveal substantial improvements
   stemming from CAP valorization of carbohydrates and lipids and DHTL
   valorization of proteins and CAP residuals. The maximum biomass-to-fuel
   conversion efficiencies for lipids/proteins/carbohydrate cell components
   are 79%/34%/75% (HBD-2), and techno-economic analysis suggests a
   3.2-62.1% reduction in minimum fuel selling prices (MFSPs). The
   increased fuel yields and reduced MFSPs highlight the flexibility of the
   hybrid systems for biofuel production, revealing advantages of these
   systems for broader ranges of feedstocks, including ones not
   traditionally considered for fuel production.

AB This paper addresses the design and techno-economic analysis of an
   integrated system for the production of biodiesel from algal oil
   produced via the sequestration of carbon dioxide from the flue gas of a
   power plant. The proposed system provides an efficient way to the
   reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and yields algae as a potential
   alternative to edible oils currently used for biodiesel production.
   Algae can be processed into algal oil by various pathways. The algal oil
   can then be used to produce biodiesel. A flowsheet of the integrated
   system is synthesized. Then, process simulation using ASPEN Plus is
   carried out to model a two-stage alkali catalyzed transesterification
   reaction for converting microalgal oil of Chlorella species to
   biodiesel. Cost estimation is carried out with the aid of ICARUS
   software. Further economic analysis is performed to determine
   profitability of the algal oil to biodiesel process. The results suggest
   that, for the algal oil to biodiesel process analyzed in this study,
   factors such as choosing the right algal species, using the appropriate
   pathway for converting algae to algal oil, selling the resulting
   biodiesel and glycerol at a favorable market selling prices, and
   attaining high levels of process integration can collectively render
   algal oil to be a competitive alternative to food-based plant oils.

AB A green extraction method is developed using partially hydrolysed
   microalgal cells grown in biocompatible solvent for simultaneous
   cultivation and extraction of bioproducts from a highly efficient
   permeabilized microalgal cell with enhanced biomass and lipid content
   for potential use in biodiesel production. Incomplete digestion of cell
   wall was achieved by regulating the incubation time of the enzymatic
   pretreatment of the microalgal cells. 15.77% increase in lipid content
   was seen when untreated cells were cultured with biocompatible solvent,
   while cultivation of these enzymatically pretreated cells with
   biocompatible solvent, the lipid content increased by 53.33% and 22%
   higher carotenoid content was observed as compared to conventional
   extraction. The total fatty acids obtained after 1st and 2nd extractions
   in untreated samples were 67.82%, while those in enzymatically partially
   digested samples were 91.94%. The untreated and partially enzymatically
   predigested strain showed suitable properties for quality biodiesel
   production as per international recommendations. The cost benefit
   analysis of the overall process showed the use of biocompatible solvent
   coupled to enzymatically predigested biomass was a favorable option as
   compared to conventional extraction.

AB The use of wastewater-grown microalgae has the potential to reduce the
   cost of algae-derived biofuels while simultaneously advancing nutrient
   recovery at water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). However, a
   significant barrier has been the low yield and high protein content of
   phototrophic biomass. Here, we examine the use of solids residence time
   (SRT) as a selective pressure in driving biochemical composition, yield,
   biofuel production, and WRRF nutrient management cost. We cultivated
   mixed phototrophic communities in controlled, laboratory-scale
   photobioreactors on the local WRRF secondary effluent to link SRT with
   biochemical composition and techno-economic analysis to yield insights
   into biomass composition and downstream processing effects on minimum
   fuel selling price. SRT significantly impacted biochemical composition,
   with total and dynamic carbohydrates the highest at low SRT (total
   carbohydrates being 0.60 and 0.32 mg-carbohydrate.mg-protein- 1 at SRT 5
   and 15 days, respectively). However, there were distinct differences
   between extant, steady-state performance and intrinsic potential, and
   longer SRT communities were able to accumulate significant fractions
   (51% on an ash-free dry weight basis, AFDW %) of carbohydrate reserves
   under nutrient starvation. Overall, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was
   found to be more suitable than lipid extraction for hydrotreating (LEH)
   and combined algal processing (CAP) for conversion of biomass to fuels,
   but LEH and CAP became more competitive when intrinsic carbon storage
   potential was realized. The results suggest that the use of algae for
   nutrient recovery could reduce the nutrient management cost at WRRFs
   through revenue from algal biofuels, with HTL resulting in a net
   revenue.

U2 442
AB Pyrolysis of protein-rich biomass, such as microalgae, macroalgae,
   sewage sludge, energy crops, and some lignocellulosic biomass, produces
   bio-oil with high nitrogen (N) content, sometimes as high as 10 wt% or
   even higher. Major nitrogenous compounds in bio-oil include
   amines/amides, N-containing heterocycles, and nitriles. Such bio-oil
   cannot be used as fuel directly since the high N content will induce
   massive emission of nitrogen oxides during combustion. The present
   review comprehensively summarized the effects of biomass compositions
   (i.e., elemental, biochemical, and mineral compositions) and pyrolysis
   parameters (i.e., temperature, heating rate, atmosphere, bio-oil
   collection/fractionation methods, and catalysts) on the contents of N
   and the N-containing chemical components in bio-oil. The migration and
   transformation mechanisms of N during the pyrolysis of biomass were then
   discussed in detail. Finally, the research gaps were identified,
   followed by the proposals for future investigations to achieve the
   denitrogenation of bio-oil.

AB Microalgae have been studied as biofactories for almost four decades.
   Yet, even until today, many aspects of microalgae farming and processing
   are still considered exploratory because of the uniqueness of each
   microalgal species. Thus, it is important to develop the entire process
   of microalgae farming: from culturing to harvesting, and down to
   extracting the desired high-value products. Based on its rapid growth
   and high oil productivities, Nannochloropsis sp. is of particular
   interest to many industries for the production of high-value oil
   containing omega-3 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid
   (EPA), but also several other products. This review compares the various
   techniques for induction, harvesting, and extraction of EPA-rich oil and
   high-value protein explored by academia and industry to develop a
   multi-product Nannochloropsis biorefinery. Knowledge gaps and
   opportunities are discussed for culturing and inducing fatty acid
   biosynthesis, biomass harvesting, and extracting EPA-rich oil and
   high-value protein from the biomass of Nannochloropsis sp.

U1 9
U2 84
AB One-stepin-situtransesterification has been recognized as an alternative
   approach to produce biodiesel from microalgae biomass. Based on
   technoeconomic perspective,in-situtransesterification of microalgae is
   more energy efficient than the conventional two-step process and thus
   economically competitive for biodiesel production. However, a
   comprehensive review on the effect of processing parameters towards
   conversion efficiency of microalgae biomass to biodiesel
   viain-situtransesterification is still lacking in the literature.
   Therefore, this review was intended to deliberate on fundamental
   understanding of this technology, including the effect of different
   reaction parameters towards biodiesel yield, technoeconomic impact of
   using wet paste microalgae, biodiesel composition profiles, and the
   state-of-the-art of the process. Besides, reaction kinetic and
   thermodynamics aspect ofin-situtransesterification from microalgae were
   also discussed in detail. This review also provided in-depth information
   for process design and intensification under
   dedicatedin-situtransesterification reaction condition for sustainable
   biodiesel production. Concurrently, research gaps
   inin-situtransesterification process was addressed for future study.

   considered sustainable. Reduce, recycle, and reuse of waste derived from
   algal bioenergy conversion process will lead to an energy efficient and
   sustainable zero-waste microalgal biorefinery. This review focuses on
   three major aspects of zero-waste microalgal biorefinery approach; (1)
   recent advances on microalgal bioenergy conversion processes (chemical,
   biochemical and thermochemical); (2) mitigation and transformation of
   liquid and solid waste and (3) techno-economic analysis (TEA) and
   lifecycle assessment (LCA). In addition, the study also focuses on the
   challenges and future perspectives for an advanced microalgal
   biorefinery model.

AB The boost of the greenhouse gases (GHGs, largely carbon dioxide - CO2)
   emissions owing to anthropogenic activity is one of the biggest global
   threats. Bio-CO2 emission reduction has received more and more attention
   as an environmentally sustainable approach. Microalgae are very popular
   in this regard because of excellent speed of growth, low costs of
   production, and resistance to extreme environments. Besides, most
   microalgae can undergo photosynthesis, where the CO2 and solar energy
   can be converted into sugar, and subsequently become biomass, providing
   a renewable and promising biofuel strategy with a few outstanding
   benefits. This review focuses on presenting CO2 sequestration by
   microalgae towards wastewater treatment and biodiesel production. First,
   the CO2 fixation mechanism by microalgae viz., sequestration and
   assimilation of CO2 in green microalgae as well as cyanobacteria were
   introduced. Besides, factors affecting CO2 sequestration in microalgae,
   containing microalgae species and cultivation conditions, such as light
   condition, photobioreactor, configuration, pH, CO2 concentration,
   temperature, and medium composition, were then comprehensively
   discussed. Special attention was given to the production of biodiesel as
   third-generation biofuel from various wastewater (CO2 biofixation),
   including processing steps of biodiesel production by microalgae,
   biodiesel production from wastewater, and improved methods. Furthermore,
   current life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA)
   used in biodiesel production were discussed. Finally, the research
   challenges and specific prospects were considered. Taken together, this
   review provides useful and updated information to facilitate the
   development of microalgal "green chemistry" and "environmental
   sustainability".

AB India is the fifth largest primary energy consumer and fourth largest
   petroleum consumer after USA, China, and Japan. Despite the global
   economic crisis, India's economy is expected to grow at 6 to 8%/year.
   There is an extreme dependence on petroleum products with considerable
   risks and environmental issues. Petroleum-derived transport fuels are of
   limited availability and contribute to global warming, making renewable
   biofuel as the best alternative. The focus on biogas and biomass-based
   energy, such as bioethanol and biohydrogen, will enhance
   cost-effectiveness and provide an opportunity for the rural community.
   Among all energy sources, microalgae have received, so far, more
   attention due to their facile adaptability to grow in the
   photobioreactors or open ponds, high yields, and multiple applications.
   Microalgae can produce a substantial amount of triacylglycerols as a
   storage lipid under photooxidative stress or other adverse environmental
   conditions. In addition to renewable biofuels, they can provide
   different types of high-value bioproducts added to their advantages,
   such as higher photosynthetic efficiency, higher biomass production, and
   faster growth compared to any other energy crops. The viability of
   first-generation biofuels production is, however, questionable because
   of the conflict with food supply. In the future, biofuels should ideally
   create the environmental, economic, and social benefits to the
   communities and reflect energy efficiency so as to plan a road map for
   the industry to produce third-generation biofuels.

AB The need for alternative source of fuel has demanded the cultivation of
   3rd generation feedstock which includes microalgae, seaweed and
   cyanobacteria. These phototrophic organisms are unique in a sense that
   they utilise natural sources like sunlight, water and CO2for their
   growth and metabolism thereby producing diverse products that can be
   processed to produce biofuel, biochemical, nutraceuticals, feed,
   biofertilizer and other value added products. But due to low biomass
   productivity and high harvesting cost, microalgae-based production have
   not received much attention. Therefore, this review provides the state
   of the art of the microalgae based biorefinery approach to define an
   economical and sustainable process. The three major segments that need
   to be considered for economic microalgae biorefinery is low cost
   nutrient source, efficient harvesting methods and production of
   by-products with high market value. This review has outlined the use of
   various wastewater as nutrient source for simultaneous biomass
   production and bioremediation. Further, it has highlighted the common
   harvesting methods used for microalgae and also described various
   products from both raw biomass and delipidified microalgae residues in
   order to establish a sustainable, economical microalgae biorefinery with
   a touch of circular bioeconomy. This review has also discussed various
   challenges to be considered followed by a techno-economic analysis of
   the microalgae based biorefinery model.

AB Large-scale microalgae cultivation for biodiesel production is expected
   to be performed utilizing open air growth infrastructure that will
   inherently introduce ash into the system. High ash biomass represents a
   significant challenge for the production of biofuel as it increases
   processing capital and operational costs. This study assesses the
   economic viability of pretreatment to remove ash from biomass grown with
   an algal turf scrubber (ATS). An engineering process model of biofuel
   production was developed based on an ATS growth system followed by an
   ash removal process and conversion of the biomass to fuels through
   hydrothermal liquefaction. The model was validated with literature data
   for the growth and conversion processes and with experimental data for
   14 de-ashing processes using water washing or alkaline extraction. The
   engineering process model was integrated with techno-economic modeling
   to investigate the impact of ash on biomass and fuel selling prices.
   Capital costs associated with biofuel conversion doubled as ash content
   increased from 0% to 70%, increasing fuel selling price by 21%.
   Integrating ash removal resulted in reduced conversion capital costs
   (14-42%) based on the reduction of total mass processed. However, only
   water washes scenarios at 25°C and 50°C were found to reduce overall
   fuel selling price, with alkaline extraction scenarios showing a
   significant increase. Operational expenses associated with alkaline
   extraction de-ashing including wastewater treatment, chemical costs, and
   heating the microalgae slurry were found to significantly increase the
   overall fuel selling price of the microalgae biofuel by 17-92% depending
   on the operational scenario.

AB Microalgae have a number of intriguing characteristics that make them a
   viable raw material aimed at usage in a variety of applications when
   refined using a bio-refining process. They offer unique capabilities
   that allow them to be used in biotechnology-related applications. As a
   result, this review explores how to increase the extent to which
   microalgae may be integrated with various additional biorefinery uses in
   order to improve their maintainability. In this study, the use of
   microalgae as potential animal feed, manure, medicinal, cosmeceutical,
   ecological, and other biotechnological uses is examined in its entirety.
   It also includes information on the boundaries, openings, and
   improvements of microalgae and the possibilities of increasing the range
   of microalgae through techno-economic analysis. According to the
   findings of this review, financing supported research and shifting the
   focus of microalgal investigations from biofuels production to
   biorefinery co-products can help guarantee that they remain a viable
   resource. Furthermore, innovation collaboration is unavoidable if one
   wishes to avoid the high cost of microalgae biomass handling. This
   review is expected to be useful in identifying the possible role of
   microalgae in biorefinery applications in the future.

AB Microalgae as an alternative feedstock for sustainable bio-products have
   gained significant interest over years. Even though scientific
   productivity related to microalgae-based research has increased in
   recent decades, translation to industrial scale is still lacking.
   Therefore, it is essential to understand the current state-of-art and,
   identify research gaps and hotspots driving industrial scale up. The
   present review through scientometric analysis attempted to delineate the
   research evolution contributing to this emerging field. The research
   trends were analysed over the last decade globally highlighting the
   collaborative network between the countries. The comprehensive knowledge
   map generated confirmed microalgal biorefinery as a scientifically
   active field, where the present research interest is focussed on
   synergistically integrating the unit processes involved to make it
   enviro-economically feasible. Market opportunities and regulatory policy
   requirements along with the consensus need to adopt circular bio-economy
   perspectives were highlighted to facilitate real-time implementation of
   microalgal biorefinery.

AB One of the major challenges associated with algal biofuels production in
   a biorefinery-type setting is improving biomass utilization in its
   entirety, increasing the process energetic yields and providing
   economically viable and scalable co-product concepts. We demonstrate the
   effectiveness of a novel, integrated technology based on moderate
   temperatures and low pH to convert the carbohydrates in wet algal
   biomass to soluble sugars for fermentation, while making lipids more
   accessible for downstream extraction and leaving a protein-enriched
   fraction behind. We studied the effect of harvest timing on the
   conversion yields, using two algal strains; Chlorella and Scenedesmus,
   generating biomass with distinctive compositional ratios of protein,
   carbohydrate, and lipids. We found that the late harvest Scenedesmus
   biomass had the maximum theoretical biofuel potential at 143 gasoline
   gallon equivalent (GGE) combined fuel yield per dry ton biomass,
   followed by late harvest Chlorella at 128 GGE per ton. Our experimental
   data show a clear difference between the two strains, as Scenedesmus was
   more successfully converted in this process with a demonstrated 97 GGE
   per ton. Our measurements indicated a release of >90% of the available
   glucose in the hydrolysate liquors and an extraction and recovery of up
   to 97% of the fatty acids from wet biomass. Techno-economic analysis for
   the combined product yields indicates that this process exhibits the
   potential to improve per-gallon fuel costs by up to 33% compared to a
   lipids-only process for one strain, Scenedesmus, grown to the mid-point
   harvest condition.

AB Advanced sustainable bioremediation is gaining importance with rising
   global pollution. This review examines microalgae's potential for
   sustainable bioremediation and process enhancement using multi-omics
   approaches. Recently, microalgae-bacterial consortia have emerged for
   synergistic nutrient removal, allowing complex metabolite exchanges.
   Advanced bioremediation requires effective consortium design or pure
   culture based on the treatment stage and specific roles. The strain
   potential must be screened using modern omics approaches aligning
   wastewater composition. The review highlights crucial research gaps in
   microalgal bioremediation. It discusses multi-omics advantages for
   understanding microalgal fitness concerning wastewater composition and
   facilitating the design of microalgal consortia based on bioremediation
   skills. Metagenomics enables strain identification, thereby monitoring
   microbial dynamics during the treatment process. Transcriptomics and
   metabolomics encourage the algal cell response toward nutrients and
   pollutants in wastewater. Multi-omics role is also summarized for
   product enhancement to make algal treatment sustainable and fit for
   sustainable development goals and growing circular bioeconomy scenario.

AB Tannery wastewater (TWW) has high BOD, COD, TS and variety of pollutants
   like chromium, formaldehydes, biocides, oils, chlorophenols, detergents
   and phthalates etc. Besides these pollutants, TWW also rich source of
   nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and sulphur etc. that can be
   utilized by microalgae during their growth. Direct disposal of TWW into
   the environment may lead severe environmental and health threats,
   therefore it needs to be treated adequately. Microalgae are considered
   as an efficient microorganisms (fast growing, adaptability and strain
   robustness, high surface to volume ratio, energy saving) for remediation
   of wastewaters with simultaneous biomass recovery and generation of
   value-added products (VAPs) such as biofuels, biohydrogen, biopolymer,
   biofertilizer, pigments, bioethanol, bioactive compounds, nutraceutical
   etc. Most microalgae are photosynthetic and use CO2and light energy to
   synthesise carbohydrate and reduces the emission of greenhouse gasses.
   Microalgae are also reported to remove heavy metals and antibiotics from
   wastewaters by bioaccumulation, biodegradation and biosorption.
   Microalgal treatment can be an alternative of conventional processes
   with generation of VAPs. The use of biotechnology in wastewater
   remediation with simultaneous generation of VAPs is trending. The
   validation of economic viability and environmental sustainability, life
   cycle assessment studies and techno-economic analysis is undergoing.
   Thus, in this review, the characteristics of TWW and microalgae are
   summarized, which manifest microalgae as potential candidates for
   wastewater remediation with simultaneous production of VAPs. Further,
   the treatment mechanisms, various factors (physical, chemical,
   mechanical and biological etc.) affecting treatment efficiency as well
   as challenges associated with microalgal remediation are also discussed.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising conversion technology in algae
   biofuel research due to its ability to agnostically convert proteins,
   carbohydrates, and lipids to biocrude. The high-temperature conditions
   that define this conversion process require the material to maintain a
   subcritical liquid state, which complicates the assessment of accurate
   thermochemical properties due to the required pressure. To clarify this
   issue, this work compares the estimated performance of algal
   hydrothermal liquefaction between different thermodynamic models. A
   process model was developed inAspen Plusfrom a robust assessment of
   current literature. Techno-economic assessment and life-cycle assessment
   metrics are derived from this model and used as key performance
   indicators. The baseline fuel price contribution of hydrothermal
   liquefaction is $0.45 per liter gasoline equivalent. Independently
   decreasing the temperature from 350°C to 260°C while maintaining yield
   reduces the conversion cost by 19%, illustrating the importance of
   understanding the high-temperature thermodynamics of the system.
   Different thermodynamic property models can vary fuel conversion cost
   results by $0.07 per liter gasoline equivalent. The baseline global
   warming potential is +23 g CO2eq MJ-1and the net energy ratio is 0.30.
   Environmental metrics beyond global warming potential and net energy
   ratio are also discussed for the first time. Uncertainties in conversion
   performance are bounded through a scenario analysis that manipulates
   parameters such as product yield and nutrient recycle to produce a range
   of economic and environmental metrics. The work is supplemented with an
   open source model to support future hydrothermal liquefaction
   assessments and accelerate the development of commercial-scale systems.

AB Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC)/liquefaction (HTL)/gasification (HTG)
   are promising processes for biofuel production from biomass containing
   high moisture. However, wastewater, the aqueous phase (AP) byproduct
   from these hydrothermal processes, is inevitably produced in large
   amounts. The AP contains >20% of the biomass carbon, and the total
   organic carbon in AP is as high as 10-20 g/L. The treatment and
   utilization of AP are becoming a bottleneck for the industrialization of
   hydrothermal technologies. The major challenges are the presence of
   various inhibitory substances and the high complexity of AP. Bioenergy
   recovery from AP has attracted increasing interest. In the present
   review, the compositions and characteristics of AP are first presented.
   Then, the progress in recovering bioenergy from AP by recirculation as
   the reaction solvent, anaerobic digestion (AD), supercritical water
   gasification (SCWG), microbial fuel cell (MFC), microbial electrolysis
   cell (MEC), and microalgae cultivation is discussed. Recirculation of AP
   as reaction solvent is preferable for AP from biomass with relatively
   low moisture; AD, MFC/MEC, and microalgae cultivation are desirable for
   the treatment of AP produced from processing biomass with low lignin
   content at relatively low temperatures; SCWG is widely applicable but is
   energy-intensive. Finally, challenges and corresponding strategies are
   proposed to promote the development of AP valorization technologies.
   Comprehensive analysis of AP compositions, clarification of the
   mechanisms of valorization processes, valorization process integration
   detoxification of AP, polycultures and co-processing of AP with other
   waste, enhancement in pollutant removal, scaling-up performance, and the
   techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of valorization
   systems are promising directions in future investigations.

AB Nannochloropsis oculatais a marine microalgal species with a great
   potential as food or feed due to its high pigment, protein and
   eicosapentaenoic acid contents. However, for such an application to be
   realized on a large scale, a biorefinery approach is necessary due to
   the high cost of microalgal biomass production. For example, techno
   economic analyses have suggested the co-production of food or feed with
   antioxidants, which can be extracted and supplied separately to the
   market. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
   cultivation conditions on the antioxidant capacity ofNannochlosopsis
   oculataextracts, derived with ultrasound-assisted extraction at room
   temperature, as well as the proximate composition and fatty acid profile
   of the biomass. A fractional factorial approach was applied to examine
   the effects of temperature (20-35°C), pH (6.5-9.5) and light period
   (24:0, 12:12). At the end of each run, biomass was collected, washed
   with 0.5M ammonium bicarbonate and freeze-dried. Antioxidant capacity as
   gallic acid equivalents as well as pigment content were measured in the
   ethanolic extracts. Optimal conditions were different for productivity
   and biomass composition. Interesting results regarding the effect of
   light period (LP) and pH require further investigation, whereas the
   effect of moisture on the extraction process was confounded with biomass
   composition. Finally, further data is provided regarding the relation
   between chlorophyll content and apparent phenolic content using the
   Folin-Ciocalteu assay, in agreement with our previous work.

AB Biochar, a solid carbonaceous substance synthesized from the
   thermochemical degradation of biomass, holds significant potential in
   addressing global challenges such as soil degradation, environmental
   pollution, and climate change. Its potential as a carbon sequestration
   agent, together with its versatile applications in soil amendments,
   pollutant adsorption, and biofuel production, has garnered attention. On
   the other hand, microalgae, with their outstanding photosynthetic
   efficiency, adaptability, and ability to accumulate carbohydrates and
   lipids, have demonstrated potential as emerging feedstock for biochar
   production. However, despite the significant potential of microalgal
   biochar, our current understanding of its various aspects, such as the
   influence of parameters, chemical modifications, and applications,
   remains limited. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive
   analysis of microalgae-based biochar, covering topics such as production
   techniques, pollutant removal, catalytic applications, soil amendments,
   and synthesis of carbon quantum dots to bridge the existing knowledge
   gap in this field.

U1 9
U2 15
AB Aquaculture systems globally face significant environmental challenges,
   particularly concerning wastewater management. This review explores the
   innovative application of oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms
   (OPhMs), specifically microalgae and cyanobacteria, as a sustainable
   solution for wastewater treatment within these systems. OPhMs offer a
   dual role in wastewater treatment by removing harmful pollutants such as
   nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals, while simultaneously improving
   water quality through oxygenation. We evaluate the integration of OPhMs
   into existing aquaculture operations, considering key factors such as
   system design, operational conditions, and economic viability.
   Additionally, we discuss the potential of algal biomass as a secondary
   resource for producing biofuels, animal feed, and other bio-products,
   contributing to the circular economy model. Our findings highlight the
   ability of OPhM systems to significantly reduce the ecological footprint
   of aquaculture while recovering valuable resources. However, challenges
   such as process stability, especially under low-temperature conditions,
   and the efficiency of biomass harvesting, require further research. This
   study provides a comprehensive framework for future development and
   optimization of OPhM-based wastewater treatment systems to improve the
   sustainability of aquaculture operations.

AB Over the last decades, microalgae have gained a commendable role in the
   rising field of biofuel production as they do not compete with food
   supply, reduce greenhouse gases emission, and mitigate CO2.
   Specifically, thermochemical processing of microalgae yields products,
   which can be used both for energy and other industrial purposes,
   depending on the algal strain, processing method and operative
   conditions. Algae are converted into various high-value products,
   including nutraceuticals, colourants, food supplements, char, bio-crude,
   electricity, heat, transportation fuel, and bio-oil. Therefore,
   microalgae are believed to be a strategic resource for the upcoming
   years and their utilization is meaningful for many industrial sectors.
   In this framework, this review addresses the various thermochemical
   processing of microalgae to various biofuels and their industrial
   significance. The obstacles in various thermochemical conversion methods
   have been critically flagged, in order to enable researchers to choose
   the optimal method for fuel production. Furthermore, light is shed on
   cultivation systems to generate rapidly microalgal biomass for
   thermochemical processing. Eventually, all recent literature
   advancements concerning microalgae cultivation and thermochemical
   processing are critically surveyed, and summarized.

TI Rice mill wastewater management in the era of circular economy.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 348
PY 2023
U1 1
U2 15
AB Several nations around the world use rice as their primary food staple
   because of its tremendous nutritional value. India's expanding
   population has sparked a proliferation of rice mills as a result of the
   country's growing rice demand. However, small and medium-scale
   industries lack adequate facilities for processing effluents and other
   waste generated. Paddy is typically processed by parboiling, which
   involves soaking it in water, boiling it with steam, and then drying and
   milling. Around 1-1.5 L of water is necessary to partially cook 1 kg of
   unhusked rice, with approximately half of this water being discharged as
   effluent. Disposal of rice mill effluent (RME) in water bodies or on the
   land causes severe damage to soil and water. An inclusive examination of
   diverse approaches for the treatment and stabilization of partially
   cooked rice milling effluents is provided. Moreover, the document
   provides a concise overview of contemporary and environmentally friendly
   technologies for treating RME. Adsorption, electrocoagulation, chemical
   coagulation, and bioremediation using microbes, plants, and microalgae
   are all included in these methods. This manuscript discusses the concept
   of a circular economy, which is focused on enhancing environmental
   sustainability through the recycling and repurposing of generated waste
   into raw materials for the creation of new products. In addition, this
   review aims to focus on the impact of RME on soils and water species and
   the status of sustainable management at the point of circular economy
   with RME bioenergy production (bioelectricity, biomethane, and
   bio-hydrogen).

   sustainable bioenergy.
SO Science of the Total Environment
VL 766
PY 2021
U1 5
U2 98
AB In recent years, microalgal feedstocks have gained immense potential for
   sustainable biofuel production. Thermochemical, biochemical conversions
   and transesterification processes are employed for biofuel production.
   Especially, the transesterification process of lipid molecules to fatty
   acid alkyl esters (FAAE) is being widely employed for biodiesel
   production. In the case of the extractive transesterification process,
   biodiesel is produced from the extracted microalgal oil. Whereas In-situ
   (reactive) transesterification allows the direct conversion of
   microalgae to biodiesel avoiding the sequential steps, which
   subsequently reduces the production cost. Though microalgae have the
   highest potential to be an alternate renewable feedstock, the
   minimization of biofuel production cost is still a challenge. The
   biorefinery approaches that rely on simple cascade processes involving
   cost-effective technologies are the need of an hour for sustainable
   bioenergy production using microalgae. At the same time, combining the
   biorefineries for both (i) high value-low volume (food and health
   supplements) and (ii) low value- high volume (waste remediation,
   bioenergy) from microalgae involves regulatory and technical problems.
   Waste-remediation and algal biorefinery were extensively reviewed in
   many previous reports. On the other hand, this review focuses on the
   cascade processes for efficient utilization of microalgae for integrated
   bioenergy production through the transesterification. Microalgal biomass
   remnants after the transesterification process, comprising carbohydrates
   as a major component (process flow A) or the carbohydrate fraction after
   bio-separation of pretreated microalgae (process flow B) can be utilized
   for bioethanol production. Therefore, this review concentrates on the
   cascade flow of integrated bioprocessing methods for biodiesel and
   bioethanol production through the transesterification and biochemical
   routes. The review also sheds light on the recent combinatorial
   approaches of transesterification of microalgae. The applicability of
   spent microalgal biomass residue for biogas and other applications to
   bring about zero-waste residue are discussed. Furthermore,
   techno-economic analysis (TEA), life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   challenges of microalgal biorefineries are discussed.

AB The integration of algae-based wastewater treatment and biofuel
   production has been of growing research interest in recent years. This
   article reviewed recent researches in algae biofuel production and the
   integration of algal wastewater treatment and biofuel production. The
   methods to algal biofuel production, biofuel productivity, and removal
   rate of treated municipal wastewater were summarized in this review.
   Chlorella is largely used, especially in biodiesel and bioethanol
   production. Spirulina is more often used to produce biogas. The removal
   rate of NH4+-N can be high in this integration. The most common biofuel
   products in this integration are biomethane and lipid. Traces of the
   integration are numerous on laboratory basis and limited in commercial
   use for now. The barrier to apply it from lab to commercial use may
   include a high cost during algae harvesting as well as land use and
   availability. Possible solutions and research gaps are outlined in this
   article.

AB Modeling efforts to understand the financial implications of microalgal
   biofuels often assume a static basis for microalgae biomass composition
   and cost, which has constrained cultivation and downstream conversion
   process design and limited in-depth understanding of their
   interdependencies. For this work, a dynamic biological cultivation model
   was integrated with thermo-chemical/biological unit process models for
   downstream biorefineries to increase modeling fidelity, to provide
   mechanistic links among unit operations, and to quantify minimum product
   selling prices of biofuels via techno-economic analysis. Variability in
   design, cultivation, and conversion parameters were characterized
   through Monte Carlo simulation, and sensitivity analyses were conducted
   to identify key cost and fuel yield drivers. Cultivating biomass to
   achieve the minimum biomass selling price or to achieve maximum lipid
   content were shown to lead to suboptimal fuel production costs.
   Depending on biomass composition, both hydrothermal liquefaction and a
   biochemical fractionation process (combined algal processing) were shown
   to have advantageous minimum product selling prices, which supports
   continued investment in multiple conversion pathways. Ultimately, this
   work demonstrates a clear need to leverage integrated modeling platforms
   to advance microalgae biofuel systems as a whole, and specific
   recommendations are made for the prioritization of research and
   development pathways to achieve economical biofuel production from

AB Rapidly changing bioremediation prospects are key drive to develop
   sustainable options that can offer extra benefits rather than only
   environmental remediation. Algal remediating is gaining utmost attention
   due to its mesmerising sustainable features, removing odour and
   toxicity, co-remediating numerous common and emerging inorganic and
   organic pollutants from gaseous and aqueous environments, and yielding
   biomass for a range of valuable products refining. Moreover, it also
   improves carbon footprint via carbon-capturing offers a better option
   than any other non-algal process for several high CO2-emitting
   industries. Bio-uptake, bioadsorption, photodegradation, and
   biodegradation are the main mechanisms to remediate a range of common
   and emerging pollutants by various algae species. Bioadsorption was a
   dominant remediation mechanism among others implicating surface
   properties of pollutants and algal cell walls. Photodegradable
   pollutants were photodegraded by microalgae by adsorbing photons on the
   surface and intracellularly via stepwise photodissociation and
   breakdown. Biodegradation involves the transportation of selective
   pollutants intracellularly, and enzymes help to convert them into
   simpler non-toxic forms. Robust models are from the green microalgae
   group and are dominated byChlorellaspecies. This article compiles the
   advancements in microalgae-assisted pollutants remediation and
   value-addition under sustainable biorefinery prospects. Moreover,
   filling the knowledge gaps, and recommendations for developing an
   effective platform for emerging pollutants remediation and realization
   of commercial-scale algal bioremediation.

AB C. pyrenoidosa, a species of microalgae, has been recognized as a viable
   protein source for human consumption. The primary challenges in this
   context are the development of an efficient extraction process and the
   valorization of the resultant waste streams. This study, situated within
   the paradigm of circular economy, presents an innovative extraction
   approach that achieved a protein extraction efficiency of 62%. The
   extracted protein exhibited remarkable oil-water emulsifying
   performances, such as uniform morphology with high creaming stability,
   suggesting a sustainable alternative to conventional emulsifiers.
   Additionally, hydrothermal liquefaction technique was employed for
   converting the residual biomass and waste solution from the extraction
   process into biocrude. A biocrude yield exceeding 40 wt%, characterized
   by a carbon content of 73% and a higher heating value of 36 MJ/kg, were
   obtained. These findings demonstrate the promising potential of
   microalgae biorefinery, which is significant for paving toward circular
   economy and zero-waste society.

   from food wastes: a concise review.
SO Sustainability
VL 14

PY 2022
U1 0
U2 15
AB The production of biofuels from microalgae has gained considerable
   attention due to the rapid diminution of fossil fuels. Despite major
   advantages, microalgal biofuels deployment still faces obstacles
   associated with the cost of biomass production and waste disposal. The
   production could become more cost-effective and feasible if the wastes
   in the production processes are recycled/reused and the biofuels
   produced are co-produced with high-value co-products. The aim of this
   review is to discuss and analyze the importance of recycling/reusing
   wastes and co-producing high-value products to be implemented with
   biofuels from microalgal-based processes. Recent advances in circular
   economy/integration and polygeneration, as proper strategies, are
   discussed. Circular economy and integration entail the reuse of food
   wastes, waste biomass, and wastewater in microalgal conversion processes
   for producing biofuels. The main focus of the section of this review on
   circular economy is food waste reuse for microalgal production.
   Polygeneration is the production of multiple products, including a
   biofuel as the main product and multiple co-products to ensure process
   cost reduction. The results reported in relevant studies have shown that
   microalgal growth and metabolite accumulation could be favored by
   mixotrophic cultivation using wastes from the conversion processes or
   reused food wastes. The co-production of high-value products, including
   pharmaceuticals, proteins, carbohydrates, pigments, bioplastics,
   pellets, and biofertilizers may also favor the sustainability of biofuel
   production from microalgae.

VL 145
PY 2021
U1 15
U2 93
AB An effective harvesting strategy with a low energy consumption as well
   as total cost is important for biofuel production. Microalgae harvesting
   by chitosan-based flocculants has received extensive attention, due to
   the outstanding structural features, biodegradability, applicability to
   various types of microalgae species and environmental friendliness.
   However, it is a significant strategy to select and prepare flocculants
   with high harvesting efficiencies for microalgae harvesting, based on
   different modifications strategies and external impact factors. This
   work reviews the latest research on chitosan-based flocculants for
   microalgae harvesting applications, including general aspects,
   harvesting mechanisms, several types of the dual harvesting system and
   surface modification methods commonly used to prepare chitosan-based
   flocculants. Suitable modification strategies for chitosan can achieve
   the high harvesting performance by improving synthetic effects and
   properties. The influences of external factors on microalgae harvesting
   are emphasized in detail. The effects of chitosan-based flocculants on
   downstream process are evaluated as well. This paper provides a
   potential prospect for future studies of chitosan-based flocculants on
   microalgae harvesting. Furthermore, uncertainties and research gaps of
   chitosan-based flocculants that exist in the usage of microalgae
   harvesting on a large scale have been put forward to foster the
   industry.

AB Developing technologies to harness biomass energy is essential for the
   transition to a low-carbon economy. Emerging biorefineries, where
   biomass energy is converted via thermochemical processes like
   Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL), could be at the core of this
   transition. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of biomass
   Hydrothermal Processes (HTP), emphasizing HTL as a sustainable approach
   to convert high-moisture, heterogeneous biomass-including municipal
   solid waste, lignocellulosic residues, and microalgae-into biofuels and
   valuable bioproducts. This review examines the flexibility of feedstocks
   suitable for hydrothermal processes, including organic solid waste, food
   waste, and sludge, while critically assessing recent advances in reactor
   design, as well as kinetic and phenomenological modeling. Additionally,
   to the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first strategies to
   model and simulate transport phenomena within HTL technology, capturing
   the structural effects generated by the chemical reactions involved. The
   analysis identifies existing challenges in understanding these
   processes, highlights research gaps, and proposes a roadmap for future
   studies. This roadmap integrates theoretical and experimental approaches
   aimed at accelerating the development of next-generation biorefineries
   and supporting the shift towards a circular bioeconomy.

AB Exploiting solar energy for growing algal biomass in waters enriched
   with farm manures is a holistic method of waste management. The proposed
   cultivation strategy termed SAR'CENA ('Synergistic Algal Refinery for
   Circular Economy using Nutrient Analogues), involves integrated
   cultivation of microalga, Scenedesmus obliquus and marine macroalga,
   Ulva lactuca in litter to harness biorefinery products. From various
   litters tested, poultry litter manure (PLM) was most amenable for
   growth. The microalga yielded 4106.2 g.DW. m-2. d-1 of biomass with
   total nitrogen (TN) concentration of 70 mg.L-1 in the media, while the
   macroalgae yielded 3349.9 g DW m-2 d-1 of biomass with TN concentration
   of 17.5 mg.L-1. The nutrient uptake efficiency was observed to be >60%
   with uncompromised biomass composition. Thus, SAR'CENA is projected as
   an ideal farming solution incorporating efficient waste management and
   feedstock generation thereby establishing a circular economy towards
   clean energy.

   each hydrothermal technique were compared concerning the yield and
   quality of bio-crude, other products yield, nutrients of an aqueous
   phase, energy consumption and overall economics. Based on the numerous
   research and review articles survey, this critical review article had
   ascertained hydrothermal liquefaction as an ideal technique for
   microalgal bio-crude production and thus, recent research works
   undertaken on the hydrothermal liquefaction of different microalgal
   species has been summarized and discussed. This article has evaluated
   and described the impact of various factors such as reaction
   temperature, residence time, pressure, catalyst dose, feedstock
   selection and its load on the hydrothermal liquefaction efficiency. A
   separate section dealing with upgrading of bio-oil delivers options to
   produce maximal bio-crude with higher heating value, low nitrogen, and
   oxygen heteroatoms. The key contribution of this review is information
   and scope itemized in this manuscript on hydrothermal liquefaction
   process can be useful in propelling the prospect research to standardize
   an intact and efficient hydrothermal liquefaction system for microalgae.

U1 1

AB Managing organic waste streams is a major challenge for the agricultural
   industry. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic wastes is a preferred
   option in the waste management hierarchy, as this process can generate
   renewable energy, reduce emissions from waste storage, and produce
   fertiliser material. However, Nitrate Vulnerable Zone legislation and
   seasonal restrictions can limit the use of digestate on agricultural
   land. In this paper we demonstrate the potential of cultivating
   microalgae on digestate as a feedstock, either directly after dilution,
   or indirectly from effluent remaining after biofertiliser extraction.
   Resultant microalgal biomass can then be used to produce livestock feed,
   biofuel or for higher value bio-products. The approach could mitigate
   for possible regional excesses, and substitute conventional high-impact
   products with bio-resources, enhancing sustainability within a circular
   economy. Recycling nutrients from digestate with algal technology is at
   an early stage. We present and discuss challenges and opportunities
   associated with developing this new technology.

AB This study investigates the production of biofuels and value-added
   products by co-digesting sugarcane leaves and microalgal biomass,
   aligning with circular economy and zero-waste principles. Hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) on continuous hydrogen production in a continuous
   stirred tank reactor was investigated. An optimal HRT of 12h maximizes
   hydrogen production rate (3,983 mL-H2/L.d) and yield (99.6 mL-H2/g-VS).
   Microbial analysis using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the Illumina
   platform indicates diverse communities, prominently featuring
   Streptococcus (43.4%) and Clostridium (31.3%) genera. The process
   efficiently utilizes residual components-acidified slurry, hydrogenic
   effluent, and solid residue-for methane and hydrogen generation,
   yielding up to 22.2 kJ/g-VS in total energy. The solid residue from
   hydrogen production exhibits composting properties and serves to produce
   vermicompost and densified refuse-derived fuel. This approach
   exemplifies the adept utilization of raw materials within a circular
   economy and zero-waste framework, yielding no waste throughout the
   entire process.

AB The potentiality of microalgae-bacteria consortia applied in a circular

   biofuel from microbial technology remains complex and controversial
   regarding the practicability of the technology. This review provides a
   concise and comprehensive analysis of various extraction techniques of
   the microalgae-bacteria consortium, algae cultivation methods, and
   biofuel production processes. The conversion processes are critically
   reviewed along with the challenges faced to lay the foundation of
   in-depth microalgae-bacteria biotechnology. The yield of biohydrogen
   produced and the lipid content of the obtained biomass can be greatly
   improved through the cultivation of a microalgae-bacteria consortium
   compared to the pure culture of microalgae. The consumption of nutrients
   in wastewater by the microalgae-bacteria consortium protects the
   environment as the effluent returned to nature is of minimum toxicity.
   The symbiotic relationship between microalgae and bacteria has enhanced
   the lipid productivity of biomass in previous studies. In contrast to
   other recent reviews, the linkage of the circular economy with the
   microalgae-bacteria consortium was critically reviewed and discussed.
   Uncertainties under culturing conditions and techno-economics are the
   concerns and factors that impede the development of microalgae-bacteria
   consortia in energy commercialization.

AB The global trend is shifting toward circular economy systems. It is a
   sustainable environmental approach that sustains economic growth from
   the use of resources while minimizing environmental impacts. The
   multiple industrial use of microalgal biomass has received great
   attention due to its high content of essential nutrients and elements.
   Nevertheless, low biomass productivity, unbalanced carbon to nitrogen
   (C/N) ratio, resistant cellular constituents, and the high cost of
   microalgal harvesting represent the major obstacles for valorization of
   algal biomass. In recent years, microalgae biomass has been a candidate
   as a potential feedstock for different bioenergy generation processes
   with simultaneous treating wastewater and CO2 capture. An overview of
   the appealing features and needed advancements is urgently essential for
   microalgae-derived bioenergy generation. The present review provides a
   timely outlook and evaluation of biomethane production from microalgal
   biomass and related challenges. Moreover, the biogas recovery potential
   from microalgal biomass through different pretreatments and synergistic
   anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) with other biowastes are evaluated. In
   addition, the removal of micropollutants and heavy metals by microalgal
   cells via adsorption and bioaccumulation in their biomass is discussed.
   Herein, a comprehensive review is presented about a successive
   high-throughput for anaerobic digestion (AD) of the microalgal biomass
   in order to achieve for sustainable energy source. Lastly, the
   valorization of the digestate from AD of microalgae for agricultural
   reuse is highlighted.

AB Bottlenecks on the development of biodiesel production could be
   eliminated using direct transesterification (DT). This review presents a
   comprehensive overview for DT from oleaginous seed crops (edible and
   non-edible), microalgal and fungal/yeast biomass. Effects of key
   operational parameters, affecting the yield of biodiesel, such as
   feedstock, feedstock processing technologies, feedstock water content,
   catalyst choice, temperature, co-solvent and reaction time are
   summarised and critically assessed. 15% and 68% of published data showed
   high fatty acid (FA) yields and FA to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)
   conversion efficiencies, respectively. Highest fatty acid yielding
   feedstock were Jatropha and a novel non-edible Mediterranean crop,Cynara
   cardunculus, the microalgaeChlorellaandNannochloropsis, and the
   fungi/yeastTrichosporon oleaginosus,Rhodosporidium toruloides,Lipomyces
   starkeyi,Mortierella isbellina, andPichia guilliermondi. For wet
   microalgal biomass, a preference for acid-catalysed direct
   transesterification was determined, while base-catalysed DT was more
   suitable for dry biomass, except for turbo-thin film-assisted DT of
   microalgal biomass. The data highlight that DT operational parameters
   and technologies need optimisation for feedstock and water content and
   outcomes may be strongly strain-dependent for microalgal feedstock. To
   bring commercial biodiesel potential of some high-yielding feedstock to
   reality, comprehensive life cycle - and techno-economic analyses are
   required for intensified and non-intensified DT processing, taking
   feedstock production and possibilities of biorefinery concepts into
   account whilst also focussing on those processing platforms that can
   esterify fatty acids in wet biomass.

AB Several key challenges are hindering large-scale cultivation of
   microalgae for industrial purposes, including wastewater treatment,
   carbon capture, biomass production, and renewable energy production.
   These challenges are closely related to efficacy of (1) resource
   utilization, (2) biomass production, and (3) harvesting. This review
   describes how attached or biofilm cultivation of microalgae and/or
   cyanobacteria with heterotrophic bacteria in consortia could
   simultaneously resolve these technical obstacles, thereby reducing
   monetary and energetic costs of producing microalgal bioenergy.
   Symbiotic relationships between these organisms reduces the need for
   aeration or exogenous supplementation of nutrients. Additionally, this
   review details how increasing biodiversity correlates with diversity of
   functionality (carbon capture and nitrification) and how
   attached/biofilm cultivation can improve photosynthetic efficiency and
   water footprint. Mixed-species biofilms have persisted for billions of
   years across earth's natural history because they are some of nature's
   most highly efficient biosystems, and they deserve more dedicated study
   and broader application in bioenergy production. This review details the
   practical connections between microalgal-bacterial consortia,
   attached/biofilm cultivation, waste-to-value biorefining, and relevance
   to bioenergy production and value-added products (VAPs); four topics
   previously unconnected in a single review. As such this review aims to
   bridge current knowledge gaps across multiple research fields and
   industrial sectors, towards the goal of efficient, economical, and
   climate-forward microalgal bio-services and bioenergy production.

AB The new trend in using photosynthetic microorganisms for the epuration
   of wastewater in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) opens a new
   question concerning the economic significance of this newly synthesized
   biomass. In this paper, we present our original results concerning the
   production of photosynthetic biomass (both prokaryotes and eukaryotes)
   and associated non- photosynthetic microbiota during the purification
   process of artificial wastewater. The results present the wet and dry
   weight quantities of weekly synthesized photosynthetic biomass (with 3
   harvesting processes per week). The obtained biomass is analysed with
   respect to the lipid content, total proteins, as well as carotenes. As
   our main task is to use this microbial biomass as valuable substrate for
   fish growth and not for the trivial usage as material for biogas
   production or fertilizer in agriculture, these results could make a big
   impact for a better utilization of natural resources, including in the
   rather new context of circular economy.

AB Microalgae have been reported to exhibit mutualistic interactions with
   other microorganisms like bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeast and
   help each other co-exist. The potential of microalgae to perform
   photosynthesis and accumulate lipids make them suitable candidates for
   lipid production. Biofuel production from various single oleaginous
   microorganisms is already in practice. However, the high cost of biomass
   harvesting, extraction of lipids, and contamination issues are
   significant challenges of biofuel bioprocess commercialization. Recent
   microalgal co-culture studies showed considerable potential for easy
   biomass harvesting and reduction in overall energy consumption cost.
   Therefore, microalgal co-culture could be an alternative to overcome
   these constraints and enhance biomass and lipid production.
   Additionally, the integration of the nutrient sequestration process from
   potential agro-industrial wastewater using microalgal co-culture can
   reduce the cost of the substrate requirement for cultivation as well as
   ecological load. The co-culture in wastewater has shown excellent total
   phosphate removal efficiencies by microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana and
   yeast Rhodotorula glutinis, nitrogen removal by microalgae C.
   sorokiniana with activated sludge, and ammonium-nitrogen removal by C.
   vulgaris and fungi Aspergillus sp. co-culture. This review summarized
   the current advances towards biofuel and its value-added production from
   various microalgae co-culture and compared it with monoculture
   fermentation. It also includes some critical challenges of co-culturing
   for the economically viable bioprocess development for biofuel
   production. Furthermore, techno-economic analysis and life-cycle
   assessment of co-culture technology were also discussed for biofuel
   production feasibility from microalgal co-culture.

AB Microalgae is being investigated as a renewable transportation fuel
   feedstock based on various advantages that include high annual yields,
   utilization of poor quality land, does not compete with food, and can be
   integrated with various waste streams. This study focuses on directly
   assessing the environmental impact of two different thermochemical
   conversion technologies for the microalgae-to-biofuel process through
   life cycle assessment. A system boundary of "well to pump" (WTP) is
   defined and includes sub-process models of the growth, dewatering,
   thermochemical bio-oil recovery, bio-oil stabilization, conversion to
   renewable diesel, and transport to the pump. Models were validated with
   experimental and literature data and are representative of an
   industrial-scale microalgae-to-biofuel process. Two different
   thermochemical bio-oil conversion systems are modeled and compared on a
   systems level, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis. The
   environmental impact of the two pathways were quantified on the metrics
   of net energy ratio (NER), defined here as energy consumed over energy
   produced, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Results for WTP biofuel
   production through the HTL pathway were determined to be 1.23 for the
   NER and GHG emissions of -11.4 g CO2-eq(MJ renewable diesel)-1. Biofuel
   production through the pyrolysis pathway results in a NER of 2.27 and
   GHG emissions of 210 g CO2-eq(MJ renewable diesel)-1. The large
   environmental impact associated with the pyrolysis pathway is attributed
   to feedstock drying requirements and combustion of co-products to
   improve system energetics. Discussion focuses on a detailed breakdown of
   the overall process energetics and GHGs, impact of modeling at
   laboratory-scale compared to industrial-scale, environmental impact
   sensitivity to systems engineering input parameters for future focused
   research and development, and a comparison of results to literature.

AB Low biomass yield and lipid production limits the development of
   microalgae-derived biodiesel on a wide scale. However, the use of
   photo-responsive nanomaterials as a substrate for microalgae can resolve
   these issues and enhance its economic viability. The current
   investigation highlights the potential of graphene oxide; graphitic
   carbon nitride (GO@CN) as a photocatalytic material
   forChlorosarcinopsissp. MAS04. A suite of characterization techniques
   including Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction
   (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Zeta
   potential was used to perceive the structural, morphological, and
   stability insights of the synthesized nanocomposite. Cytotoxicity assay
   for 96 h was performed for testing microalgal viability. Subsequently,
   microalgae cultures were supplemented with 0-200 mg L-1of synthesized
   nanocomposite for 30 days. The intracellular reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) concentration was estimated to determine the oxidative stress
   burden. The incurred cellular lipids were processed into fatty acid
   methyl esters (FAMEs) possessing suitable biodiesel characteristics. The
   50 mg L-1of the optimal supplement of GO@CN for microalgae cultivation
   results in the highest biomass and lipid production of 3.825 g L-1and
   38.5% respectively, that is a 1.5-fold increase in biomass and nearly a
   1.9-fold rise in lipid content, compared to the control. Additionally, a
   cost-benefit analysis of the developed process inferred a 350% increase
   in FAME yield at an expense of 0.15 g/INR more than the cost estimated
   for the control. Thus, this amalgamation of nano-algal science could be
   a prospective approach for augmenting microalgae-based biodiesel as a
   sustainable bioeconomy.

   economically beneficial microalgal biodiesel technology. In this study,
   the performance and economic potential of the conversion
   ofScenedesmussp. lipids to biodiesel over lipid extracted algae (LEA)
   derived catalysts were investigated. The lipid extracted algae (LEA)
   derived catalysts (Ni/C and Ni/Fe3O4-C) were synthesized by impregnation
   technique and characterized using different analytical tools. The
   biodiesel conversion of 96.43%, 98.5% and 95.12% was achieved using
   biochar (C), Ni/C, and Ni/Fe3O4-C respectively under the following
   conditions: reaction time (4 h), temperature (60°C), methanol to oil
   molar ratio (30:1) and catalyst dosage (15% w/w of oil). The findings
   from this study have shown that the use of lipid extracted algae derived
   catalysts reduced the unit production cost of microalgal biodiesel from
   2.03 $/kg to (1.70-1.74 $/kg) when compared to homogeneous catalyst.
   Among the lipid extracted algae derived catalysts, the use of Ni/C
   catalyst gave the lowest unit production cost (1.70 $/kg) for biodiesel
   production from microalgae. The recyclability potential of the LEA
   derived catalysts could improve the economic viability of the process.
   The payback period in the range of 1.32 yr-5.57 yr obtained using LEA
   derived catalysts was below the lifespan of the project (10 years),
   suggesting that the proposed microalgal biodiesel production is
   economically feasible.

AB In the next quarter-century, global demand for energy is expected to
   increase more than 25%, while some analysts are predicting that output
   of petroleum will soon peak. This reality of increasing demand in the
   face of diminishing fossil supplies is spurring interest in renewable
   energy sources. An array of biomass-for-bioenergy resources has been
   proposed, with perennial, lignocellulosic feedstocks showing the
   greatest potential. Assessment of potential biomass energy resources is
   difficult, however, as uncertainties over available land and crop yields
   swing reported estimates from 35 to 1135 EJ/year. In the USA, it has
   been suggested that more than 1 billion tonnes (910 million Mg) of
   biomass could be sustainably harvested, but these estimates are
   dependent on continued gains in plant productivity, nutrient use
   efficiency and soil and water conservation. Variables of population
   growth and increased standards of living will also affect the
   availability of land for these energy-producing endeavours. Several
   biofuel sources have been identified to include waste streams,
   microalgae and woody biomass plantations. With herbaceous-based systems,
   much effort is currently being given to corn and other starch or grain
   crops that can be readily converted to ethanol. While these crops may
   serve to jumpstart the biofuel industry, they have much less potential
   to meet demand and much greater potential for negative environmental
   impacts. Long-term, high-yielding perennial species will be better
   suited to meet the requirements for sustainability, but they are
   currently plagued by limitations in pretreatment and processing
   technologies. Further upstream of the conversion facility loom the
   questions of logistics, e.g. how does one handle and move a bulky,
   distributed resource in a cost-effective manner? In addition, there are
   important interactions between each component of the supply chain -
   agronomy, logistics and processing - that are best not studied in
   isolation. Important social issues also stand to influence farmer
   decisions regarding market entry which will affect in turn the function
   and profitability of a biorefining industry. Once at the facility,
   several possible biomass conversion technologies may be employed,
   including (but not limited to) pyrolysis to syn-gas and bio-oils or
   sugar hydrolysis and fermentation to ethanol. Both have drawbacks, and
   the limitation for cellulosic feedstocks remains an economical method of
   conversion. It is widely believed that this challenge will be met, but
   the question of 'when?' remains. Other, larger questions about the
   development of bioenergy resources reside outside the system, with
   policy being one of the biggest. For example, bioenergy systems may be
   more cost-competitive if policy allows them to benefit from the
   potential ecosystem services they provide, e.g. sequestering carbon.
   However, such policies may also encourage farmers to convert food crop
   land to energy crop land, with concomitant ripple effects throughout the
   economy. These and other policy-related risks increase uncertainty; this
   uncertainty will limit investments, especially large-scale investments,
   in such industries. Bioenergy systems may also face social hurdles from
   those who view them as inimical to the interests of local and global
   producer.

AB Microalgae-based treatment can be applied to the bioremediation of
   agro-industrial wastewater, aiming at a circular economy approach. The
   present work compared the technical-environmental feasibility of
   operating a bubble column photobioreactor (PBR) and a high rate pond
   (HRP) for microalgae biomass production and wastewater treatment of a
   meat processing facility. The comparison was made regarding biomass
   productivity, phytoplankton composition, treatment efficiency, life
   cycle assessment, and energy balance. The daily yields of total biomass
   and the maximum specific growth rates were 483.33 mg L-1 d-1 and 0.23
   d-1 for PBR and 95.00 mg L-1.d-1 and 0.193 d-1 for HRP, respectively,
   with a predominance of the species Scenedesmus acutus. The treatment
   efficiency of COD (~50%) and phosphorus (100%) were similar in the two
   reactors. However, the PBR showed greater assimilation of ammoniacal
   nitrogen (100% removal) due to the higher microalgal biomass
   productivity. Environmental impacts were assessed through the ReCiPe
   methodology for midpoint and endpoint levels. Results revealed that CO2
   supply was the most impactful process for both systems (>60%), but HRP
   reached lower environmental burdens (-105.90 mPt) than PBR (60.74 mPt).
   Energy balance through the Net Energy Ratio also resulted in the HPR
   advantage over the PBR (NER = 14.23 and 1.09, respectively). Still, both
   reactors present advantages when applied to different valorization
   routes. At the same time, both present room for improvement in the light
   of bioeconomy and biorefineries, aiming at sustainable wastewater
   treatment plants.

AB Cyanobacteria are Gram negative, photosynthetic and nitrogen fixing
   microorganisms which contribute much to our present-day life as
   medicines, foods, biofuels and biofertilizers. Western Ghats are the
   hotspots of biodiversity with rich combination of microbial flora
   including cyanobacteria. Though cosmopolitan in distribution, their
   abundance in tropical forests are not fully exploited. To fill up this
   knowledge gap, the present research was carried out on the
   cyanobacterial flora of Peruvannamuzhi forest and Janaki forests of
   Western Ghats in Kozhikode District, North Kerala State, India.
   Extensive specimen collections were conducted during South-West monsoon
   (June to September) and North-East monsoon (October to December) in the
   year 2019. The highest diversity of cyanobacteria was found on rock
   surfaces. A total of 18 cyanobacterial taxa were identified. Among them
   filamentous heterocystous forms showed maximum diversity with 10 species
   followed by non- heterocystous forms with 8 species. The highest number
   of cyanobacteria were identified from Peruvannamuzhi forest with 15 taxa
   followed by Janaki forest with 3 taxa. The non- heterocystous
   cyanobacterial genus Oscillatoria Voucher ex Gomont showed maximum
   abundance with 4 species. In this study we reported Planktothrix
   planktonica (Elenkin) Agagnostidis & Komarek 1988, Oscillatoria euboeica
   Anagnostidis 2001 and Nostoc interbryum Sant'Anna et al. 2007 as three

AB Microalgae are promising sustainable energy sources for biodiesel
   production due to their rapid photosynthesis growth rate and capacity to
   be cultivated in wastewater, seawater, or freshwater. Moreover,
   microalgae could complete the entire growth cycleviaphotosynthesis
   reactions that convert light energy into renewable energy. The closed
   photobioreactor, PBR is resistant to infection from uninhabited algae
   species and allows frequent monitoring of various factors such as
   temperature, light intensity, and pH during the cultivation phase. Thus,
   this study focuses on continuous cultivation technology which produces
   higher biomass productivity with sustainable energy-saving operation as
   compared to batch culture. High productivity of microalgae biomass tends
   to accumulate higher concentrations of lipid and carbohydrates
   composition which is essential for the production of biofuels. The
   energy balance of numerous microalgae-based biofuels was discussed, and
   it was discovered that the net-energy ratio was greater than 1,
   indicating that the process is both commercially feasible and
   environmentally friendly. This study also summarizes the most recent
   discoveries on continuous cultivation constraints through
   photobioreactors, PBRs as well as potential challenges to tackle in
   scaling up the continuous sustainable culture mechanism. The research
   gaps, market opportunities, and future development directions of
   continuous photobioreactor systems are discussed to explore future
   development opportunities. A continuous photobioreactor, architecture is
   recommended for a pilot-scale trial, as a cost-benefit comparison would
   be beneficial in commercializing the framework.

U1 23
U2 57
AB In recent years, biofuel production has attracted considerable
   attention, especially given the increasing worldwide demand for energy
   and emissions of greenhouse gases that threaten this planet. In this
   case, one possible solution is to convert biomass into green and
   sustainable biofuel, which can enhance the bioeconomy and contribute to
   sustainable economic development goals. Due to being in large quantities
   and containing high organic content, various biomass sources such as
   food waste, textile waste, microalgal waste, agricultural waste and
   sewage sludge have gained significant attention for biofuel production.
   Also, biofuel production technologies, including thermochemical
   processing, anaerobic digestion, fermentation and bioelectrochemical
   systems, have been extensively reported, which can achieve waste
   valorization through producing biofuels and re-utilizing wastes.
   Nevertheless, the commercial feasibility of biofuel production is still
   being determined, and it is unclear whether biofuel can compete equally
   with other existing fuels in the market. The concept of a circular
   economy in biofuel production can promote the environmentally friendly
   and sustainable valorization of biomass waste. This review
   comprehensively discusses the state-of-the-art production of biofuel
   from various biomass sources and the bioeconomy perspectives associated
   with it. Biofuel production is evaluated within the framework of the
   bioeconomy. Further perspectives on possible integration approaches to
   maximizing waste utilization for biofuel production are discussed, and
   what this could mean for the circular economy. More research related to
   pretreatment and machine learning of biofuel production should be
   conducted to optimize the biofuel production process, increase the
   biofuel yield and make the biofuel prices competitive.

AB The amount of water removed from harvested algae and the required
   quantity of solvent for efficient oil recovery impact the overall
   economic viability of transforming algae to bioenergy . Thus, in this
   study, the effect of total solids (TS) content and solvent-to-biomass
   ratio on oil recovery from Nannochloropsis oculata and Nannochloropsis
   salina (both referred to in this work as Nannocloropsis spp. and
   representative of marine species of algae) and Scenedesmus obliquus (a
   freshwater specie) was studied using modified Bligh & Dyer (B-D) method
   and Soxhlet extraction (with either hexane or ethanol as solvent).
   Adopting the modified B-D method, a maximum oil content exists between
   10 and 20 wt% TS. Oil recovered with ethanol (with no pretreatment) and
   hexane (on acid hydrolyzed algae) with thimble increases with both TS
   (varied from 10 to 20 wt%) and solvent-to-biomass ratio (varied from 10
   to 25). Conversely, oil yield increases with solvent-to-biomass ratio
   but reduces with TS due to enhanced mixing and mass transfer, increase
   in partition coefficient of lipids during downstream separation at lower
   TS, and implementation of hexane extraction without thimble. Hexane
   extraction was subsequently performed on acid hydrolyzed algae in a
   scale-up model and a 98% performance was achieved while about 60% of
   algal oil at the optimum data point was transformed to biodiesel with no
   significant impact by the solvent-to-biomass ratio or scale-up. Ethanol
   recovers mostly polar lipids and potentially forms an azeotrope with
   water which makes green diesel production less favorable and solvent
   recoverability challenging, respectively while the use of a large
   quantity of chloroform is unsafe. Thus, ethanol extraction and modified
   Bligh-Dyer methods were not performed in the scale-up model. Results
   from the application of our techno-economic analysis (TEA) model
   indicate that predicted sale price of Hydrotreated Algal Oil (HTAO) at
   each of the oil extraction data points decreases with increase in the
   oil content of algae, using a base case of 10000 barrel per day of HTAO
   with credits from animal feed and nutraceutical production. At the
   optimum data point, the predicted sale price of HTAO is $8.59 per
   gallon.

AB The conventional wastewater treatment process (WWTP) is under continuous
   improvement, mainly to reduce the final pollutant contents in the
   effluent. The circular economy concept is driving this industry towards
   the recovery of the carbon (C) and nutrient (nitrogen - N and phosphorus
   - P) loads as valuable products, also to answer issues related to their
   depletion in nature. In this context, microalgae cultivation on
   wastewater has shown great promise in both water purification and the
   recovery of nutrients through additional biomass production. The further
   direction of the algal biomass to anaerobic co-digestion with wastewater
   sludge promises biogas yield improvements directing more of the carbon
   to energy recovery. Recent 100+ publications are here reviewed with the
   objective of compiling and comparing data on the cultivation of
   microalgae on domestic wastewater drawn from different stages of the
   conventional WWTP. A wide range of reactor types and scales, microalgae
   and bacteria inocula, and operational conditions are included, focusing
   on carbon and nutrient removal performance and the extent of their
   recovery in the produced biomass. However, most studies do not provide
   enough data tracking N, P, and C contents to allow the determination of
   their distribution among the possible system outputs. Still, some
   studies quantify the importance of removal mechanisms such as
   volatilization and precipitation, as well as microalgae uptake.
   Tentative mass balances on the three keys elements are presented, using
   the data disclosed in these few studies, highlighting the usefulness of
   these calculations and the need for their inclusion in future studies.

AB Urbanization is a revolutionary and necessary step for the development
   of nations. However, with development emanates its drawback i.e.,
   generation of a huge amount of wastewater. The existence of diverse
   types of nutrient loads and toxic compounds in wastewater can reduce the
   pristine nature of the ecosystem and adversely affects human and animal
   health. The conventional treatment system reduces most of the chemical
   contaminants but their removal efficiency is low. Thus, microalgae-based
   biological wastewater treatment is a sustainable approach for the
   removal of nutrient loads from wastewater. Among various microalgae,
   Tetraselmis sp. is a robust strain that can remediate industrial,
   municipal, and animal-based wastewater and reduce significant amounts of
   nutrient loads and heavy metals. The produced biomass contains lipids,
   carbohydrates, and pigments. Among them, carbohydrates and lipids can be
   used as feedstock for the production of bioenergy products. Moreover,
   the usage of a photobioreactor (PBR) system improves biomass production
   and nutrient removal efficiency. Thus, the present review
   comprehensively discusses the latest studies on Tetraselmis sp. based
   wastewater treatment processes, focusing on the use of different
   bioreactor systems to improve pollutant removal efficiency. Moreover,
   the applications of Tetraselmis sp. biomass, advancement and research
   gap such as immobilized and co-cultivation have also been discussed.
   Furthermore, an insight into the harvesting of Tetraselmis biomass,
   effects of physiological, and nutritional parameters for their growth
   has also been provided. Thus, the present review will broaden the
   outlook and help to develop a sustainable and feasible approach for the
   restoration of the environment.

AB Microalgae have been developed as promising candidates for bioenergy
   production, coupled with answering challenges related to water pollution
   and global warming. When combined with wastewater, microalgal biomass
   production could be freed from a strong dependence on freshwater and
   chemical nutrients, as well as achieve the additional advantage of
   wastewater reclamation. However, despite those dual benefits, certain
   limitations on the growing of algae in wastewater remain to be resolved,
   including the inevitable presence of bacteria in wastewater, which
   influences biomass productivity and quality in various ways. Pointing at
   microalgal-bacterial relationships, this study provides an updated
   review of the application of microalgal-bacterial consortia (MABC) to
   benefit biomass yield and harvest, and in wastewater remediation,
   focusing on the main interactions established between the microorganisms
   integrated within MABC and the factors influencing the behaviours of
   MABC. The challenges faced by the MABC biotechnology are also discussed,
   which are primarily rooted in undesirable bacteria that parasitically
   eat microalgal products and inhibit algal growth through nutrient
   competition, lysate exudation, or reducing the algal resistance to
   biotic stress. However, there is a lack of systematic studies on
   maintaining stable and effective operation of MABCs for wastewater
   cultivation and high-value bioproduct generation. Knowledge gaps are
   identified as including systematic information about the responses of
   MABC to culture conditions and wastewater-borne bacterial communities,
   and the metabolic mechanisms underpinning the interactions between algae
   and bacteria in wastewater. Further research focuses and methodologies
   are proposed in this review, making full use of the advent of omics and
   computational technology.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a green technology for biocrude
   production at high temperatures (200-500°C) and high pressure (5-30
   MPa). There are important gaps in HTL reaction optimization, process
   design, and the effect of operating parameters. To facilitate overcoming
   these research gaps in future studies, this review summarizes the
   scientific and engineering applications of HTL. The objective of this
   study is to assess the production of biocrude from algae using HTL and
   compare it with wood and waste biomasses as a potential feedstock. The
   influence of effective parameters on the optimum HTL biocrude yield was
   investigated. Moreover, kinetic, economic, and exergy analyses have been
   considered in HTL studies. The result showed that the highest biocrude
   yield was attained at 50 wt%, 30 wt%, and 20 wt% using microalgae, wood,
   and macroalgae at an optimum temperature range of 300-350°C for less
   than 60 min. The kinetic models were successful at all reaction
   temperatures and times for biocrude yield prediction. Moreover, the
   minimum fuel selling price varied between $1.70 and $22/GGE. The exergy
   studies indicated that the overall exergy efficiency was in the range of
   20-96%. However, direct HTL has some drawbacks such as severe operation
   conditions and biocrude production with high nitrogen and oxygen
   contents. Several processes were considered to address these problems.
   The two-stage, microwave, catalytic cracking, additives, and
   hydro-treatment upgrading process improve the biocrude properties, while
   the supercritical fluids and emulsification upgrading process helped
   dissolve insoluble materials. Furthermore, pretreatment processes such
   as bead milling, ultrasonic, and microwave were suggested to promote
   biomass cell wall disruption.

AB This thesis with six chapters aims to obtain more insight in the
   mechanism of triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in microalgae that are
   exposed to adverse growth conditions, and to translate the obtained
   knowledge to optimal culture conditions for efficient TAG production. In
   Chapter 2, it was tested whether TAG accumulation indeed serves as an
   energy sink when microalgae are exposed to an energy imbalance caused by
   nutrient limitation. The kinetics of TAG accumulation and energy use
   under nitrogen limitation were further explored in Chapter 3. In Chapter
   4, a genome based model was presented that describes the primary
   metabolism of model green microalgaChlamydomonas reinhardtiiin more than
   300 enzymatic steps. In Chapter 5, the metabolic model forC.
   reinhardtiiwas extended to accurately describe the primary metabolism of
   oleaginous algae. Further, important knowledge gaps were indicated in
   Chapter 6, such as the compartmentalization of TAG synthesis, variations
   in TAG production rates throughout the day/night cycle, and TAG
   accumulation regulation and its relation to photosynthesis. Finally, the
   thesis suggests how metabolic engineering could be applied for
   increasing the TAG content and productivity in the current production
   strains. Besides increasing the fluxes through the lipid biosynthetic
   pathways by enzyme overexpression and knocking down competing pathways
   for carbon and energy, preventing the photosynthetic losses associated
   with nitrogen limitation should be the most important target for
   metabolic engineering strategies. Moreover, further investigation into
   the signalling mechanisms that control TAG accumulation and
   photosynthetic adaptation under nitrogen shortage is necessary.

AB Bioconversion of nutrients and energy from landfill leachate (LL) to
   biohydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) using dark fermentation (DF)
   is a promising technique for developing a sustainable ecosystem.
   However, poor performance of DF caused by vulnerable fermentative
   bacteria vitality and strong LL toxicity significantly hinder its
   commercialization. Herein, an integrated technique linking microalgae
   photosynthesis and DF was proposed, in which mixed microalgae were
   applied to robustly reclaim nutrients and chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   from LL. Then, microalgae biomass was fermented into biohydrogen and
   VFAs using the DF process. Underlying synergistic mechanisms of the
   interaction of Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella vulgaris resulting
   from the functioning of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were
   discussed in detail. For better absorption of nutrients from LL, the
   mixed microalgae secreted obviously more EPS than pure microalgae, which
   played vital roles in the assimilation of cellular nutrients by forming
   more negative zeta potential and secreting more
   tyrosine-/tryptophan-family proteins in EPS. Besides, mixed microalgae
   produced more intracellular proteins and carbohydrates than the pure
   microalgae, thereby providing more feedstock for DF and achieving higher
   energy yield of 10.80 kJ/L than 6.64 kJ/L that was obtained when pure
   microalgae were used. Moreover, the energy conversion efficiency of
   7.75% was higher for mixed microalgae than 4.77% that was obtained for
   pure microalgae. This work may inspire efficient disposal of LL and
   production of bioenergy, together with filling the knowledge gaps of
   synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgal interactions.

AB The harnessing of microalgae for CO2sequestration and biodiesel
   production has garnered significant interest due to its potential to
   mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and provide a renewable energy. The
   current research delving the dual applications of carbon sequestration
   efficiency and biodiesel synthesis competence of three microalgal
   strains ofChlorella vulgarisLCM605,Chlorococcum humicolaLCM606,
   andQuadrigula closterioidesLCM607 (hereafterQ.closterioides) isolated
   from coal mining site, Neyveli, India. Among the tested strains, theQ.
   closterioidesexhibited high lipid content (37.65% dwt) under
   CO2supplementation and was selected in this study. CO2-tolerant
   microalgae were acclimated to high salinity concentration (100 mM) and
   enhanced lipid content of 50.94 (% dwt). The highest MUFA content
   (48.62-95.52%) was observed in three strains, desirable for biodiesel
   production. Fuel quality was found to be complying with the limits of
   international biodiesel standards. To the best of our knowledge, this is
   the first report validating that coal mine microalgaeQ. closterioideshas
   the potential for sequestering CO2and producing biodiesel under 15% CO2.
   This research highlights the potential ofQ. closterioidesfor
   CO2sequestration and biodiesel production, emphasizing the importance of
   optimizing culture parameters for maximizing biomass and lipid yields.
   This study addresses the research gap in identifying microalgal species
   with dual functionality for CO2sequestration and biodiesel production,
   specifically targetingQ. closterioidesfrom coal mine environment. By
   assessing its growth and lipid accumulation in this unique setting, the
   study explores its untapped potential for sustainable bioenergy
   applications.

U2 7
AB Phycoremediation has been discussed as a multipurpose strategy to refine
   various waste streams for sustainable algal biomass, value-added
   compounds, and biodiesel production. While phycoremediation has been
   explored for various wastewaters, there is still a research gap in
   systematical understanding the impact of abattoir water discharge (AWD)
   on both algal growth and biodiesel quality. The present study evaluated
   the potential of Chlorella sorokiniana to grow at different ratios of
   AWD, 30-90%, v/v with conventional growth medium. Results showed that
   nutrient removal efficiency after 12 days of cultivation reached up to
   85% for total nitrogen, 78% for total phosphorus, 70% for potassium, and
   65% for sodium. Thus, all algae-treated AWD samples showed Kelly ratio
   (KR) values less than 1, confirming their suitability for direct
   application in soil irrigation. In addition, there were insignificant
   variations in algal growth and biomass yield across all treatments.
   Interestingly, carotenoids yield showed significant increase in all AWD
   ratios, with the highest recorded value of 0.750 mg L-1 at day 12 using
   90% AWD, compared to 0.523 mg L-1 in the control. Among various
   treatments, C. sorokiniana grown in 90% AWD exhibited the highest lipid
   content of 201.6 mg g-1 algal dw (comparing to 180.6 mg g-1 dw in the
   control). The biodiesel derived from C. sorokiniana at different AWD
   ratios demonstrated promising characteristics due to enhancement of
   saturated fatty acids proportion, which resulted in lower iodine value,
   longer oxidation stability, and higher cetane number than the control.

AB Background: The production of glucose from cellulose requires
   cellulases, which are obtained from decomposing microorganisms such as
   fungi and bacteria. Among the cellulases, beta-glucosidases convert
   cellobiose to glucose and have low concentration in commercial cocktails
   used for the production of second-generation (2G) ethanol. Genetic
   engineering can be used to produce recombinant beta-glucosidases, and
   cyanobacteria may be interesting bioreactors. These photosynthetic
   microorganisms can be cultured using CO2emitted from the
   first-generation ethanol (1G) industry as a carbon source. In addition,
   vinasse, an effluent of 1G ethanol production, can be used as a source
   of nitrogen for cyanobacteria growth. Thus, photosynthetic bioreactors
   cannot only produce cellulases at a lower cost, but also reduce the
   environmental impact caused by residues of 1G ethanol production.
   Results: In the present work, we produced a strain ofSynechococcus
   elongatuscapable of expressing high levels of a heterologous
   beta-glucosidase from a microorganism from the Amazonian soil. For this,
   the pET system was cloned into cyanobacteria genome. This system uses a
   dedicated T7 RNA polymerase for the expression of the gene of interest
   under the control of a nickel-inducible promoter. The results showed
   that the pET system functions efficiently inS. elongatus, once nickel
   induced T7 RNA polymerase expression which, in turn, induced expression
   of the gene of the microbial beta-glucosidase at high levels when
   compared with non-induced double transgenic strain. beta-glucosidase
   activity was more than sevenfold higher in the transformed cyanobacteria
   than in the wild-type strain. Conclusions: The T7 system promotes high
   expression levels of the cloned gene inS. elongatus, demonstrating that
   the arrangement in which an exclusive RNA polymerase is used for
   transcription of heterologous genes may contribute to high-level gene
   expression in cyanobacteria. This work was the first to demonstrate the
   use of cyanobacteria for the production of recombinant
   beta-glucosidases. This strategy could be an alternative to reduce the
   release of 1G ethanol by-products such as CO2and vinasse, not only
   contributing to decrease the cost of beta-glucosidase production, but
   also mitigating the environmental impacts of ethanol industrial plants.

AB Following the surging demand for sustainable biofuels, biogas production
   via anaerobic digestion (AD) presented itself as a solution for energy
   security, waste management, and greenhouse gas mitigation. Algal-based
   biorefinery platform serves an important role in the AD-based
   closed-loop circular economy. Other than using whole biomass of micro-
   and macroalgae as feedstock for biogas production, the integration of AD
   with other bio- or thermochemical conversion techniques can achieve
   complete valorization of biomass residue after processing or valuable
   compounds extraction. On the other hand, anaerobic digestate, the
   byproduct of AD processes can be used for microalgal cultivation for
   lipid and pigments accumulation, closing the loop of resource flow.
   Furthermore, algae and its consortium with bacteria or fungi can be
   employed for combined biogas upgrading and wastewater treatment.
   Innovative strategies have been developed to enhance biogas upgrading
   and pollutant removal performance as well as minimize O2and N2content in
   the upgraded biomethane.

U2 22
AB Biomethane is a viable alternative to natural gas and diesel for
   decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as agriculture, industry and
   heavy transport. Unlike conventional biogas upgrading, photosynthetic
   biogas upgrading cogenerates biomethane, biofertiliser and microalgal
   bioproducts with the potential to improve resource utilisation and
   process performance in a circular economy. In this paper, a
   photosynthetic biogas upgrading-based polygeneration process is proposed
   and analysed to co-produce biofuel (biomethane), bio-fertiliser
   (digestate) and food (Spirulinapowder, protein supplement) using
   agricultural feedstock. Based on a multi-criteria performance
   assessment, the economic and environmental benefits of the process are
   demonstrated. Thermodynamic performance of the process revealed that
   reducing the energy for greenhouse heating to cultivate microalgae would
   enable a higher energy output than input. Using economic allocation, a
   carbon footprint of biomethane less than 10 gCO2-eq/MJ (lower than 32.9
   gCO2-eq/MJ for sustainable biomethane use in transport in the EU
   Renewable Energy Directive (Recast) (RED-II));Spirulinaprotein of 0.8
   kgCO2-eq/100 g protein (compared to 50 kgCO2-eq/100 g protein for beef);
   and digestate of 0.4 kgCO2-eq/kgN (comparing positively to 1.5-3
   kgCO2-eq/kgN for synthetic nitrogenous fertiliser) was achieved. Unlike
   the current RED-II mandated methodology, the analysis established that
   the energy, CO2emissions, land and water footprints of each co-product
   are best represented using an economic allocation principle. Based on
   the extended nutrition profile,Spirulinaas a complete food outperforms
   most meat and plant-based protein alternatives in terms of CO2emissions,
   land, and water footprints.

AB Nannochloropsis gaditana is a non-flagellated microalgae that has been
   widely used for different purposes, mostly related with the industrial
   production of biofuels or aquiculture. However, in order to increase the
   economic viability of the obtained microalgae biomass from a production
   plant coupled to a coal power plant, a proteomic approach was initiated
   by using fresh and atomized microalgae samples, as the main used
   commercial forms. Above 51,000 high quality spectra were obtained per
   sample in the MS/MS analysis of whole proteome of N. gaditana, yielding
   above 7,500 peptides, leading the identification of 1,950 proteins, from
   the N. gaditana protein database, where 655 proteins were presented in
   all the replicates. The identified proteins were categorized according
   to gene ontology classification by molecular function and biological
   process. In this study, it has been described the first proteomic
   analysis of the microalgae N. gaditana under industrial conditions
   containing an important number of identified proteins. A significative
   presence of proteins with a potential role in different agri-food and
   biomedical applications was detected and studied being the core of
   future N. gaditana research to expand the current biotechnological
   applications of this microalga. Significance of the study: Three
   quarters of the planet earth correspond to seas and oceans, however its
   potential biotechnological use is still unknown. We described the first
   proteomic description of the microalgae N. gaditana under industrial
   conditions. Following the spirit of the EU initiatives of blue growth
   and the statements of circular economy, CO2 waste from a coal plant
   power has been transformed in a resource for microalgae biomass
   production, common product presentations were evaluated by proteomic,
   and its potential use of identified proteins in Agri-food and
   Biomedicine has been revealed.

AB This work presents a computational framework for investigating the
   economics of phosphorus (P) recovery infrastructures in the dairy sector
   based on cyanobacterial (microalgal) cultivation. Our framework
   integrates supply chain and techno-economic analysis to assess the
   potential of large- and small-scale open pond raceways (OPRs) and bag
   photobioreactors (PBRs). We explore the integration of these cultivation
   systems with anaerobic digestion, dry algal biomass production, and
   biofuel/biogas production units. To guide our assessment, we propose
   three economic indicators that we call the "social milk incentive"
   (SMI), "social animal incentive" (SAI), and "social phosphorus
   incentive" (SPI). The SMI is defined as the revenue necessary to achieve
   a zero net present value (NPV) for the infrastructure, relative to the
   total amount of milk produced in the studied region. The SAI is the
   revenue required relative to the number of cows in the region, and the
   SPI is the revenue required relative to the total P recovered by the
   infrastructure. These indicators facilitate comparisons between
   alternative infrastructure layouts, highlight incentives needed, and can
   help communicate hidden costs of dairy farming to the public. We use our
   framework for analyzing infrastructures that recover P in the Upper
   Yahara watershed region in Wisconsin, which currently faces severe
   nutrient pollution. Our results show that an infrastructure comprising a
   single, centralized OPR coupled with a dry algal production unit
   requires the lowest SMI (0.33 USD/gal) and that this incentive
   represents 17% of the current price of milk (1.85 USD/gal). Our
   framework also reveals that increasing the growth rate of algae by 20%
   (e.g., via metabolic engineering) can potentially eliminate the need for
   incentives (SMI of 0 USD/gal). Moreover, we found that the best SPI
   achievable (22 USD/kg P) is below a recent estimate of the economic
   impact of P pollution (74.5 USD/kg P); as such, the proposed
   infrastructure provides a viable avenue to mitigate nutrient pollution
   and associated environmental costs.

AB Many studies have used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to
   assess the environmental impacts and energetic suitability of microalgal
   biofuels. This paper presents a critical review focused on goal and
   scope, system boundaries, functional unit, Life Cycle Inventories (LCI)
   and environmental impacts of 41 LCA of algal biofuels. The comparison
   between these LCA has been made difficult by the heterogeneity of their
   underlying hypotheses and perimeters. Hence we propose to define
   methodological guidelines to harmonize results presentation in order to
   improve the validity of each new contribution and to ease its comparison
   to other studies. LCA allows detecting pollution transfers between
   production stages as well as between distinct environmental impacts. At
   the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) level, a special attention should be paid
   to the perimeter of the study (e.g. inclusion of infrastructures) and to
   the handling of the co-products (allocation or substitution). Moreover
   the inventory data have to be treated in a consistent way in order to
   guarantee the comparability of LCI between different studies. Hence we
   recommend that data of all the production steps should be given at a
   unit process level, i.e. the smallest element for which input and output
   data can be quantified. At the Life Cycle Impact Assessment level, other
   impacts than the greenhouse gases balance have to be taken into account,
   like impacts related to the use of fertilizers (acidification and
   eutrophication) and phytosanitary products (human toxicity and
   ecotoxicity), impacts of direct and indirect land use change, and water
   consumptions. Finally, as biofuel is aiming at replacing existing energy
   productions, an energy balance should always be carried out; the
   Cumulative Energy Demand Ratio offers a convenient framework in that
   regard.

AB Microalgal starch is considered as renewable and sustainable feedstock
   for biofuels and biorefinery. High cell density culture is favourable
   for photoautotrophic starch production in microalgae in the aspects of
   productivity and economy, but it often encounters low starch content or
   extra stress exposure that limits the production. This study aimed to
   economically enhance photosynthetic starch production from CO2fixation
   in a green microalgaTetraselmis subcordiformisby regulating
   photosynthetic stress status with a signalling molecule
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) combined with the application of high
   initial cell density culture. By increasing initial cell density (ICD)
   from the normal of 1.1 g L-1(NICD) to as high as 2.8 g L-1(HICD), the
   starch content, yield, and theoretical productivity were improved by 7%,
   63%, and 42%, respectively. The addition of GABA under HICD resulted in
   14%, 19%, and 26% of further enhancement in starch content, yield, and
   theoretical productivity, respectively. GABA exhibited distinct
   regulatory mechanisms on photosynthesis and stress status under HICD
   relative to NICD. GABA augmented excessive light energy absorption and
   electron transfer through photosystem II that reinforced the
   photoinhibition under NICD, while alleviated the stress reversely under
   HICD, both of which facilitated starch production by enabling a suitable
   stress status while simultaneously maintaining a sufficient
   photosynthetic activity. The increase of ICD and/or GABA supply
   particularly boosted amylopectin accumulation, leading to the changes in
   starch composition and was more favourable for fermentation-based
   biofuels production. Preliminary techno-economic analysis showed that
   the highest net extra benefit of 9.64 $ m-3culture could be obtained
   under HICD with 2.5 mM GABA supply where high starch content (62%DW) and
   yield (2.5 g L-1) were achieved. The combined HICD-GABA regulation was a
   promising strategy for economic starch production from CO2by microalgae
   for sustainable biomanufacturing.

U2 43
AB Rapeseed meal (RSM) have high potential as an important alternative
   feedstock in industrial biotechnology. Recently, the pace of development
   for RSM processing and fermentation have increased significantly. A wide
   variety of pretreatment and hydrolysis methods have been developed for
   media production; including fungal pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis,
   acidic hydrolysis, autohydrolysis as well as microwave. Meanwhile, RSM
   has been applied to a wide variety of fungal, bacterial and microalgal
   fermentation schemes including, solid-state, semi-solid-state and
   submerged fermentation. As a result, a myriad of products has been
   derived from RSM, including enzymes, antimicrobials, bioactive
   compounds, platform chemicals, biosurfactants and biopolymers. The role
   of RSM within these fermentation schemes has also evolved, from
   providing a simple matrix for solid state fermentation, to being the
   main source for nitrogen, micronutrients and carbon. RSM is also
   promising due to potential economic and environmental advantages that
   could be gained from its use in integrated biorefining. This may include
   fermentation of other rapeseed-derived by-product streams such as
   glycerol or rapeseed straw, the fractionation of RSM to produce
   additional high-value products including protein isolates and phenolic
   extracts, as well as process integration with existing rapeseed oil
   refining or biodiesel production. Quantification of economic and
   environmental benefits of using RSM over purified substrates will need
   to be conducted in the future, via technoeconomic and life cycle
   analysis. Other knowledge gaps such as the feeding of RSM-derived media,
   improving process performance, scale-up related challenges also will
   need to be addressed. This will be crucial for the realization of RSM's
   potential in industrial biotechnology and may provide insights for
   development and commercialization of alternative feedstocks in general.

AB Industrial wastewater treatment is of paramount importance considering
   the safety of the aquatic ecosystem and its associated health risk to
   humankind inhabiting near the water bodies. Microalgae-based
   technologies for remediation of environmental pollutants present avenues
   for bioenergy applications and production of value-added biochemicals
   having pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, antioxidants, carbohydrate,
   phenolics, long-chain multi-faceted fatty acids, enzymes, and proteins
   which are considered healthy supplements for human health. Such a wide
   range of products put up a good case for the biorefinery concept.
   Microalgae play a pivotal role in degrading complex pollutants, such as
   organic and inorganic contaminants thereby efficiently removing them
   from the environment. In addition, microalgal species, such as
   Botryococcus braunii, Tetraselmis suecica, Phaeodactylum tricornutum,
   Neochloris oleoabundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Arthrospira, Chlorella, and
   Tetraselmis sp., etc., are also reported for generation of value-added
   products. This review presents a holistic view of microalgae based
   biorefinery starting from cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, the
   potential for remediation of environmental pollutants, bioenergy
   application, and production of value-added biomolecules. Further, it
   summarizes the current understanding of microalgae-based technologies
   and discusses the risks involved, potential for bioeconomy, and outlines
   future research directions.

AB The algal biotechnology together with the wastewater treatment can
   contribute to the production of renewable energies such as bioethanol,
   biodiesel and biohydrogen and solve many of the challenges currently
   facing the shortage of fossil fuels and environmental impacts. Hydrogen
   as the cleanest source of energy is a promising alternative to
   conventional fossil fuels. Among different technologies for hydrogen
   production, photosynthetic microorganism, such as microalgae, has a
   great potential to produce hydrogen, by using only water and sunlight.
   One of the great opportunities is that microalgae can be cultivated in
   urban wastewater, which contains sources of carbon and nutrients,
   helping to reduce the cost of biomass and energy production. Microalgae
   C. vulgaris and S. obliquus immobilized grown in urban wastewater was
   proposed for the production of biohydrogen by sulfur deprivation and two
   light quality prior to anaerobic condition at pH 7.5 and 30°C and 140
   E/m2/s of light intensity. The results indicate that blue light induces
   greater algal growth than under Purple light, while the maximum hydrogen
   production was for cultures under purple light of 128 mL H2/L
   (productivity 204.8 mL H2/L/day) and 60.4 mL H2/L (productivity 39.18 mL
   H2/L/day) for S. obliquus and C. vulgaris, respectively. An additional
   advantage is the high removal of organic carbon by S. obliquus cultures
   under purple incident light compared to C. vulgaris, being a double
   benefit; energy production and wastewater treatment.

AB The increasing trend in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
   industrialization, and the current consumer-centric lifestyle has led to
   the generation of different waste sources. There are three foci in this
   research. First, the performance of Chlorella sp. was assessed for the
   remediation of domestic wastewater (DWW) in a batch process (t = 8 days)
   using ambient air (0.04% CO2 ppmv). Second, various external solid
   wastes such as poultry and piggery litter were explored to complement
   the lower nitrogen content in DWW. Addition of poultry litter in DWW
   improved the biomass productivity (133 mg L-1d-1) by 70.51%.
   Subsequently, the inclusion of flue gas resulted in a maximum CO2
   fixation rate of 261 mg L-1, and 20-folds increment in biomass
   concentration under mixotrophic mode. Finally, the overall biomass
   productivity was increased by 82.69% under semi-continuous mode when all
   three forms of waste were utilized than the batch process. This research
   promoted a circular-economy concept for biomass production for
   biorefinery applications through the implementation of a system
   integration approach to mitigate solid, liquid, and gaseous waste.

AB There has been an increase in the amount of focus placed on
   microalgae-based technology in recent years, due to its great
   performance in wastewater treatment, nutrient restoration, and
   manufacture of alternative biofuels or other high-value commodities.
   However, the difficulties of harvesting biomass hinder the deployment of
   microalgae-based technology for continuous wastewater treatment and
   resource recovery. This article analysed the worldwide dynamics of
   microalgae bio-granulation research from 2011 to 2023 based on a
   bibliometric analysis of 250 publications extracted from the Scopus
   database. The research progression, prominent contributors in the
   subject, and latest developments and research gaps were determined using
   the Scopus database. The results show a rapid increment in the annual
   publications, with China as the most active nation in this study field,
   followed by India, United State, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and
   Malaysia. The research trend in microalgae bio-granulation show most
   research focusing on the incorporation of microalgae-bacteria symbiosis
   for granulation. However, there are almost no research on development of
   denser single-species microalgae granules without bacteria for easy
   harvesting via self-flocculation. Besides that, till today there are no
   study that investigate the effect of organic nutrient (glucose) and
   inorganic nutrient (sodium bicarbonate) on microalgae granulation. In
   addition, there are lack of studies use Chlorella Vulgaris microalgae
   species in bio-granulation process. An outline of possible future
   research was given, with a focus on technology used, nutritional media
   and environmental studies, and the microorganism selection.

TI Assessing the environmental impact of resource recovery from dairy
   manure.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 330
PY 2023
U1 1
U2 44
AB Manure management is a major contributor to environmental impacts from
   large-scale dairy production. In this study, technologies for recovering
   energy, nutrients, and water from dairy manure were evaluated using life
   cycle assessment (LCA) and compared to conventional practices on
   California dairy farms. Six scenarios were evaluated: conventional
   manure management practices, anaerobic digestion (AD) for biogas
   recovery, and four scenarios for nutrients, energy, and water integrated
   recovery, called NEWIR. The NEWIR system consists of hydrothermal
   carbonization (HTC) for energy recovery via hydrochar, algae cultivation
   in the HTC aqueous product for nutrient recovery and production of
   protein-rich cattle feed, and water recovery from algae pond effluent
   via membrane distillation. Four NEWIR scenarios were evaluated, each
   with a different species of algae. Based on the results of the LCA, AD
   improves GHG emissions relative to conventional practices by 82%, but
   has similar eutrophication impacts, posing similar concerns for nutrient
   management as current practices. Results for the NEWIR system are highly
   dependent on the algae species used. Three of the four species evaluated
   (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris, andScenedesmus obliquus)
   improve GHG emissions by 420-500 kg CO2-eq. per functional unit, while
   net water consumption is increased by approximately 75% over AD and
   conventional practicesSpirulina maximarequires more water and chemical
   inputs for cultivation than the other species, resulting in higher water
   use (21 times higher than baseline), though GHG emissions are still
   reduced by 85 kg CO2-eq. per functional unit relative to conventional
   practices. All NEWIR scenarios improve eutrophication impacts relative
   to AD and conventional practices by 16-46% for marine eutrophication and
   18-99% for freshwater eutrophication, depending on the algae species
   used. The results suggest integrated resource recovery through NEWIR is
   a promising treatment method for manure to mitigate GHG emissions and
   improve nutrient management on large-scale farms. In addition, carbon
   and nutrient trading policies are discussed in relation to resource
   recovery technologies and their potential to incentivize producers to
   recover products from dairy manure.

AB Among different biofuel feedstocks, algal biodiesel is seen as a
   promising feedstock. Different research papers have assessed the
   sustainability of algal biofuel production, but it is always difficult
   to have a better sense of the results since comparing them with all the
   differences in data sources, life cycle assumptions, functional units
   and environmental metrics measured is difficult. The present study
   develops a comparative life cycle assessment of algal biofuel production
   under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions with different inputs.
   SimaPro 8 was used considering five different scenarios for microalgae
   cultivation to compare environmental impacts, energy demand and damage
   analysis associated with water scarcity methodology. Open ponds with
   three different assumptions of using fresh water, recycled water and
   waste water, and photobioreactor and heterotrophic technologies are
   considered. Results were analyzed per energy basis - the functional unit
   of 1 MJ of energy produced. Results of total GHG emissions show that
   algae cultivated in pond with wastewater and heterotrophic culture are
   competitive with tradition fossil fuels. Also the use of algae as the
   source of energy might increase the energy demand, whereas it does not
   have adverse impact on the environment, health and climate. The results
   of the water scarcity indicator show the competiveness of algae oil.
   This study presents an overview of environmental impacts throughout the
   full life cycle of a product through different pathways in cultivation
   stage which demonstrates the importance of decision-making process for
   further investment.

AB A bio-based circular economy is fundamental to catalyzing the transition
   to a new economic model that thrives well within the planet's ecological
   limits. The microalgae biorefinery, which consists of converting biomass
   into multiple products, operates in light of the principles of a
   circular economy. Therefore, as the pivot of a new economic paradigm
   that aims to promote ecological robustness, the main scope and
   motivation of this article are to use life cycle assessment to
   scrutinize the environmental sustainability of a microalgae-based
   biorefinery system. We assume beta-carotene as the flagship of the
   microalgae industry and evaluate the sustainability metrics and
   indicators of two residual products: bulk oil and defatted biomass. The
   role of the use of renewable energy in the unit operations of the
   biorefinery was also evaluated. The results of this study show that
   waste products contribute an almost insignificant fraction of the
   ecological footprint and the cost and energy demand of the
   microalgae-based biorefinery. It is also confirmed from the results that
   the transition from coal-based energy to renewable is the most realistic
   path to production with significantly lower emissions. In sum, the
   consolidation of the microalgae biorefinery seems to be just around the
   corner, and our highlights can help make this a successful route.

AB A key advantage of using microalgae for biofuel production is the
   ability of some algal strains to thrive in waters unsuitable for
   conventional crop irrigation such as saline groundwater or seawater.
   Nonetheless, the availability of sustainable water supplies will provide
   significant challenges for scale-up and development of algal biofuels.
   We conduct a partial techno-economic assessment based on the
   availability of freshwater, saline groundwater, and seawater for use in
   open pond algae cultivation systems. We explore water issues through
   GIS-based models of algae biofuel production, freshwater supply
   (constrained to less than 5% of mean annual flow per watershed) and
   costs, and cost-distance models for supplying seawater and saline
   groundwater. We estimate that, combined, these resources can support
   9.46*107 m3 yr-1 (25 billion gallons yr-1) of renewable biodiesel
   production in the coterminous United States. Achievement of larger
   targets requires the utilization of less water efficient sites and
   relatively expensive saline waters. Despite the addition of freshwater
   supply constraints and saline water resources, the geographic
   conclusions are similar to our previous results. Freshwater availability
   and saline water delivery costs are most favorable for the coast of the
   Gulf of Mexico and Florida peninsula, where evaporation relative to
   precipitation is moderate. As a whole, the barren and scrub lands of the
   southwestern U.S. have limited freshwater supplies, and large net
   evaporation rates greatly increase the cost of saline alternatives due
   to the added makeup water required to maintain pond salinity. However,
   this and similar analyses are particularly sensitive to knowledge gaps
   in algae growth/lipid production performance and the proportion of
   freshwater resources available, key topics for future investigation.

AB This study investigated the phycoremediation process from swine
   digestate integrated with photosynthetic biomass and biogas production
   in the context of circular economy. Effects of total ammonia nitrogen
   (TAN) and pH on biomass productivity and nutrients removal, using a
   central rotational composite design, were evaluated. pH showed a
   significant effect on biomass productivity and phosphate removal. The
   strain Chlorella sorokiniana (LBA#39) was able to tolerate up to 1300 mg
   TAN L-1 at neutral pH, with maximum biomass productivity of 198 mg DW
   L-1 d-1 and removal of 90 and 70 (%) of phosphate and nitrogen,
   respectively. The biomass harvested after phycoremediation from
   digestate showed high content of volatile solids (95.4%) and proteins
   (59.5%). Biochemical methane potential (BMP) from microalgae
   monodigestion was 292  10 mLNCH4 gVSadd-1. The use microalgae biomass
   addition in the biodigestion process increased up to 32.1% in biogas
   production. It is an attractive approach to integrating raw materials
   into existing agro-industrial facilities and improving biogas
   production, adopting the concept of circular economy and mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Waste is a problem in agriculture, however, there is the possibility of
   adding value to the management of this waste. The literature explores
   the potential of agricultural waste treatment technologies, but, it is
   necessary to systematize the knowledge on the subject. It is necessary
   to understand which solutions are being developed and which technologies
   are more consolidated to motivate the development of these solutions.
   Thus, this study aims to present a panoramic view of research in
   agricultural waste treatment technologies. The method adopted was
   bibliometric analysis. We show which technologies are more consolidated
   in the scientific community. Several biological and thermal solutions
   were found. Heavy metals, chemical and biological contaminants are major
   concerns in treatment processes. Anaerobic digestion and composting are
   the technologies most explored in the scientific community. Other
   technologies are microalgae, pyrolysis, algae, biorefineries,
   combustion, incineration, gasification, anaerobic co-digestion,
   hydrothermal carbonization, vermicomposting, biosynthesis process, dry
   anaerobic digestion and photobioreactors. This article systematizes and
   consolidates the knowledge about the technologies that can be applied to
   the management of agricultural residues, which is important for the
   consolidation of the field of research and strategic development of
   these solutions. The adoption of technologies is a significant step
   towards a circular economy model.

AB Algae are some of the fastest growing organisms in the world, with up to
   90% of their weight made up from carbohydrate, protein and oil. As well
   as these macromolecules, microalgae are also rich in other high-value
   compounds, such as vitamins, pigments, and biologically active
   compounds, All these compounds can be extracted for use by the
   cosmetics, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food industries, and the
   algae itself can be used for feeding of livestock, in particular fish,
   where on-going research is dedicated to increasing the percentage of
   fish and shellfish feed not derived from fish meal. Microalgae are also
   applied to wastewater bioremediation and carbon capture from industrial
   flue gases, and can be used as organic fertilizer. So far, only a few
   species of microalgae, including cyanobacteria, are under mass
   cultivation. The potential for expansion is enormous, considering the
   existing hundreds of thousands of species and subspecies, in which a
   large gene-pool offers a significant potential for many new producers.
   Completely revised, updated and expanded, and with the inclusion of new
   Editor, Qiang Hu of Arizona State University, the second edition of this
   extremely important book contains 37 chapters. Nineteen of these
   chapters are written by new authors, introducing many advanced and
   emerging technologies and applications such as novel photobioreactors,
   mass cultivation of oil-bearing microalgae for biofuels, exploration of
   naturally occurring and genetically engineered microalgae as cell
   factories for high-value chemicals, and techno-economic analysis of
   microalgal mass culture. This excellent new edition also contains
   details of the biology and large-scale culture of several economically
   important and newly-exploited microalgae,
   includingBotryococcus,Chlamydomonas,Nannochloropsis,Nostoc,Chlorella,Spi
   rulina,Haematococcus, andDunaniellaspecies/strains. Edited by Amos
   Richmond and Qiang Hu, each with a huge wealth of experience in
   microalgae, its culture, and biotechnology, and drawing together
   contributions from experts around the globe, this thorough and
   comprehensive new edition is an essential purchase for all those
   involved with microalgae, their culture, processing and use.
   Biotechnologists, bioengineers, phycologists, pharmaceutical, biofuel
   and fish-feed industry personnel and biological scientists and students
   will all find a vast amount of cutting-edge information within this
   Second Edition. Libraries in all universities where biological sciences,
   biotechnology and aquaculture are studied and taught should all have
   copies of this landmark new edition on their shelves.

AB Due to resource scarcity, current industrial systems are switching from
   waste treatment, such as wastewater treatment and biomass, to resource
   recovery (RR). Biofuels, manure, pesticides, organic acids, and other
   bioproducts with a great market value can be produced from wastewater
   and activated sludge (AS). This will not only help in the transition
   from a linear economy to a circular economy, but also contribute to
   sustainable development. However, the cost of recovering resources from
   wastewater and AS to produce value-added products is quite high as
   compared to conventional treatment methods. In addition, most
   antioxidant technologies remain at the laboratory scale that have not
   yet reached the level at industrial scale. In order to promote the
   innovation of resource recovery technology, the various methods of
   treating wastewater and AS to produce biofuels, nutrients and energy are
   reviewed, including biochemistry, thermochemistry and chemical
   stabilization. The limitations of wastewater and AS treatment methods
   are prospected from biochemical characteristics, economic and
   environmental factors. The biofuels derived from third generation
   feedstocks, such as wastewater are more sustainable. Microalgal biomass
   are being used to produce biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen, biogas,
   biooils, bioplastics, biofertilizers, biochar and biopesticides. New
   technologies and policies can promote a circular economy based on
   biological materials.

SO Journal of Cleaner Production
VL 137
PS 813-820
PY 2016
U1 1
U2 33
AB Environmental impact of CO2-expanded fluid extraction technique in
   microalgae oil acquisition was quantitatively analyzed using life cycle
   assessment (LCA) method and compared with other available extraction
   techniques. It was found that CO2-expanded fluid extraction technique
   exhibited only one-tenth of environmental impact over other extraction
   methods, particularly on organic respiratory and climate change.
   Achieved low environmental impact was mainly attributed to the high
   extraction efficiency that further allows it for operating in mild
   pressure and shortened period of time, which dramatically decreases the
   energy consumption and afterwards environmental impacts. Utilizing
   renewable energy for CO2-expanded fluid extraction would further lower
   its environmental impact by minimizing carbon footprint resulting from
   electricity generation. Importantly, based on water-energy nexus
   consideration, the low environmental impact along with low energy
   consumption of CO2-expanded fluid extraction technique arises an
   opportunity to regard microalgae oil an energy storage vessel in
   response to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. This would be a
   new incentive for the development of microalgae oil production.

AB In Italy, watermelon cultivation spans 9510 hectares, with production
   levels largely influenced by seasonal market demand. As a result,
   surplus watermelon left unsold by September often remain in the fields,
   where they decompose naturally and go to waste. A chemical analysis of
   the watermelon liquid fraction waste (WW) indicates a high carbohydrate
   concentration, highlighting the potential for biotechnological
   valorization of this waste stream, converting it into lipids or
   exopolysaccharides (EPSs). This study investigates the feasibility of
   utilizing WW as an alternative growth substrate for microalgae, aligning
   with circular economy principles and advancing sustainable agricultural
   practices. By repurposing agricultural byproducts, this research
   supports biorefinery objectives, aiming to convert biomass into
   high-value secondary products, including biofuels, pigments, and
   nutraceuticals. Scenedesmus and Chlorella strains demonstrated promising
   growth and adaptability in WW, achieving biomass yields of 0.95  0.07 g
   L-1 and 0.37  0.02 g L-1, respectively, with a significant EPS
   production observed as medium gelation. Although lipid accumulation was
   limited in this case by the WW substrate, the lipid profiles of both
   strains were distinctively altered, notably lacking linolenic acid.

AB Bio-jet fuel is increasingly being produced from feedstocks such as
   algae and tested in flight. As the industry adopts bio-jet fuels from
   various feedstocks and conversion processes, life cycle assessment (LCA)
   is necessary to determine whether these renewable fuels result in lower
   life cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions than conventional jet fuel.
   An LCA was performed for a functional unit of 1 GJ of bio-jet fuel
   produced through thermochemical conversion (hydrothermal liquefaction
   (HTL)) of microalgae cultivated in wastewater effluent. Two pathways
   were analyzed to compare the impacts of siting HTL at a wastewater
   treatment plant (WWTP) to those of siting HTL at a refinery. Base cases
   for each pathway were developed in part using primary data from algae
   production in wastewater effluent and HTL experiments of this algae at
   the University of Kansas. The LC-GHG emissions of these cases were
   compared to those of conventional jet fuel, and a sensitivity analysis
   and Monte Carlo analyses were performed. When algal conversion using HTL
   was modeled at a refinery versus at the WWTP site, the transportation
   steps of biomass and waste nutrients were major contributors to the
   LC-GHG emissions of algal bio-jet fuel. The LC-GHG emissions were lower
   for the algal bio-jet fuel pathway that performs HTL at a WWTP (35.2 kg
   CO2eq/GJ for the base case) than for the pathway for HTL at a refinery
   (86.5 kg CO2eq/GJ for the base case). The LCA results were particularly
   sensitive to the extent of heat integration, the source of the heat for
   HTL, and the solids content of dewatered algae. The GHG emissions of
   algal bio-jet fuel can be reduced by 76% compared to conventional jet
   fuel with feasible improvements in those sensitive parameters and siting
   HTL at a WWTP. Therefore, it is critical that transportation logistics,
   heat integration of biomass conversion processes, and nutrient supply
   chains be considered as investment and production of bio-jet fuels
   increase.

AB Over the years, significant research efforts have been made to extract
   bioactive compounds by applying different methodologies for various
   applications. For instance, the use of bioactive compounds in several
   commercial sectors such as biomedical, pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical,
   nutraceutical and chemical industries, has promoted the need of the most
   suitable and standardized methods to extract these bioactive
   constituents in a sophisticated and cost-effective manner. In practice,
   several conventional extraction methods have numerous limitations, e.g.,
   lower efficacy, high energy cost, low yield, etc., thus urges for new
   state-of-the-art extraction methodologies. Thus, the optimization along
   with the integration of efficient pretreatment strategies followed by
   traditional extraction and purification processes, have been the primary
   goal of current research and development studies. Among different
   sources, algal biome has been found as a promising and feasible source
   to extract a broader spectrum of bioactive compounds with point-of-care
   application potentialities. As evident from the literature, algal
   bio-products includes biofuels, lipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   pigments, enzymes, polysaccharides, and proteins. The recovery of
   products from algal biomass is a matter of constant development and
   progress. This review covers recent advancements in the extraction
   methodologies such as enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE),
   supercritical-fluid extraction (SFE), microwave-assisted extraction
   (MAE) and pressurized-liquid extraction (PLF) along with their working
   mechanism for extracting bioactive compounds from algal-based sources to
   meet bio-economy challenges and opportunities. A particular focus has
   been given to design characteristics, performance evaluation, and
   point-of-care applications of different bioactive compounds of
   microalgae. The previous and recent studies on the anticancer,
   antibacterial, and antiviral potentialities of algal-based bioactive
   compounds have also been discussed with particular reference to the
   mechanism underlying the effects of these active constituents with the
   related pathways. Towards the end, the information is also given on the
   possible research gaps, future perspectives and concluding remarks.

AB Controversy exists to quantify the fate and speciation of Arsenic (As).
   We investigated its characteristics by As-containing algae in various pH
   hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) system, specifically via two classical
   methods, i.e. the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) and
   Wenzel's method. Solid residue immobilized 11.23-16.55% of As, and
   88.07-82.44% was in aqueous by the pH regulators (e.g., CH3COOH, HCl,
   and KOH). ICP-MS and XRD analysis revealed that As (V) was converted
   into As (III) and As (0) in the solid residue, while the As (V) was
   mainly converted into As (III) in the aqueous phase during HTL. When the
   classified forms of As in solid residue are compared, Wenzel's method
   was more appropriate for dividing the bio-availability forms of As,
   whereas BCR was better for estimating the toxic-potential forms of As.
   Subsequently, pH regulators raised the risk of As in solid residue
   associated with the increasing of unstable forms. The amide was
   hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid with acidic additives, which weakened the
   reducing environment in the HTL process. In contrast, the amide was
   hydrolyzed to ammonia with the alkaline additives, which enhanced the
   reducing environment and increased the risk of As in products. This work
   provided a new insight in systematically evaluating the risk and
   speciation of As in HTL.

   solutions for greenhouse gas emission, waste mitigation, and risk of
   falling in oil prices for operators of oil sands with creating market
   opportunities. They include the addition of microalgae biomass in
   tailings ponds for improvement of the microbial balance for the water
   speedily cleaning, recycling, and reusing with mitigation of GHG
   emissions. The use of food scraps for the nutrition of microalgae will
   reduce greenhouse gas emission minimally, on 0.33 MtCO2eq for Alberta
   and 2.63 MtCO2eq/year for Canada. Microalgae-derived biofuel can reduce
   this emission for Alberta on 11.9-17.9 MtCO2eq and for Canada on 71-106
   MtCO2eq/year, and the manufacturing of other products will adsorb up to
   135.6 MtCO2and produce 99.2 MtO2. The development of the Live Conserve

AB Biogas production via anaerobic digestion is highly attractive in the
   realm of microalgae technology. However, the microalgae harvesting
   strategies for biogas production has yet to be comprehensively
   evaluated. Here, a comparative life-cycle assessment for microalgae
   harvesting scenarios of centrifugation (CT), sedimentation and
   centrifugation (SD-CT), flocculation and centrifugation (FC-CT),
   flocculation and electro-flotation (FC-EF) were conducted to evaluate
   the energy conversion characteristics and environmental impacts. The
   results showed that harvesting strategies significantly affected the net
   energy yield of the whole system. Only scenarios FC-CT and FC-EF
   achieved positive net energy yield of 0.17 and 0.04 MJ with 1 MJ net
   energy output. The net energy yield of scenarios SD-CT and CT were
   negative (-0.11 and -1.92 MJ) because of the low harvesting efficiency
   and high electricity consumption. The net GHG emissions of the four
   scenarios were all positive, and scenario FC-EF achieved the least GHG
   emissions (21.86 g CO2-eq MJ-1). According to the nutrient balance
   analysis of carbon, about 15 percent carbon from flue gas was fixed by
   microalgae in the form of soil fertilizer (9.32%) and biomethane product
   (5.63%-6.60%). Additionally, harvesting efficiency and biogas yield had
   the most profound impact on the parameters for two-step and one-step
   harvesting scenarios.

AB This paper assessed the potential environmental impacts generated in the
   life cycle of biodiesel which was made from microalgae cultivated in
   open ponds. The functional unit was 1 MJ diesel product. The results
   showed that the most prominent impact category in the life cycle of
   microalgae biodiesel was non-renewable resources depletion potential,
   and the second one was photochemical ozone creation potential. The total
   environmental impact indicator in the life cycle of microalgae biodiesel
   was 4.63*10-4 equivalent persons, decreased by 19.34% than that of
   fossil diesel, and the life cycle total environmental impact indicator
   of rapeseed biodiesel was 7.19 times of that of microalgae based
   biodiesel. The contributions of stages of microalgae cultivation and
   biodiesel conversion to the life cycle total environmental impact
   indicator of microalgae biodiesel were 28.23% and 46.61% respectively.
   Biodiesel made from microalgae cultivated in open ponds has better
   environmental performance than fossil diesel and biodiesel made from
   rapeseed. The essential measure to control the environmental impacts in
   the life cycle of microalgae biodiesel is to reduce the power
   consumption in the stages of microalgae cultivation and biodiesel
   conversion.

TI A combined light regime and carbon supply regulation strategy for

AB The replacement of fossil fuels with clean and renewable biofuels is of
   both research and market interest for realising a circular economy.
   However, microalgae-based biofuels have shown promise as alternative
   low-carbon biofuels to other crop-based biofuels, some key obstacles in
   their production remain to be addressed, such as high costs and low
   lipid productivity. In this study, aChlorellasp. CSH4 was cultivated
   using a combined light regime and carbon supply regulation strategy to
   enhance sugar industrial wastewater bioremediation, biomass accumulation
   and lipid production. Blue light irradiance of 200 mumol photons
   m-2s-1together with 10 g/L glucose and 9.2 g/L glycerol supply was found
   to effectively enhance the biomass accumulation and pollutant-removal
   capacity ofChlorellasp. during the growth phase and its lipid production
   during the stationary phase. Furthermore, the biodiesel properties of
   the lipid retrieved fromChlorellasp., as demonstrated by its fatty acid
   profile, were found to be suitable for commercial application. Possible
   mechanisms were explored to explain how this combined strategy caused
   this microalga to exhibit highly efficient biomass and lipid production
   together with efficient pollutant removal. Moreover, upscaled
   semi-continuous treatment using both sugar industry wastewater and
   negligible carbon sources (e.g., food waste hydrolysate and crude
   glycerol) with a mass balance analysis was conducted to initially
   validate the feasibility of applying our combined strategy for
   microalgae-based wastewater treatment. In sum, this study demonstrated
   the feasibility of cultivating a microalga using a combined strategy
   comprising a light regime and carbon supply regulation to achieve both
   wastewater treatment and low-carbon biofuel production.

AB The potential environmental impacts of bio-oil production from algal
   biomass via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and its upgrading in
   renewable diesel were obtained. The gate-to-gate boundary was applied to
   obtain 1 MJ of energy as the functional unit. Marine eutrophication was
   the most impacted category due to N emission from the aqueous phase. In
   other categories, the HTL process was more harmful to the environment
   due to heat demand, and bio-oil upgrading contributed to 79% of the
   environmental impacts in the climate change category. The sensitivity
   analysis highlighted the importance of the residual heat recovery in the
   HTL reactor, indicating the potential to reduce up to 52% of impacts on
   marine ecotoxicity with a 10% increase in this parameter. Finally, a new
   scenario was proposed to reduce the heat input into the HTL reactor and
   recirculate the aqueous phase after dilution. Results demonstrated a 45%
   reduction in the potential environmental impacts and a 2x greater energy
   balance than the base scenario. In the new scenario was emitted 0.1349
   kg of CO2 eq per MJ. In the damage assessment, the new scenario caused
   less damage than the base scenario, showing the benefits of the proposed
   improvements. When comparing the bio-oil from the new scenario with the
   conventional diesel, damage in the resource scarcity category was
   decreased by 6x. The environmental sustainability of microalgae
   biotechnology for bio-oil obtention through HTL still has to be
   improved, especially concerning subproducts valorization and heat
   recovery in the reaction.

AB Photoautotrophic algal cultivation is challenging due to the shadowing
   effect produced by an increase in the number of cells; under such
   circumstances, mixotrophic growth might be an efficient alternative. We
   grew cultures of the autochthonous acidotolerant
   microalgaElliptochlorissp. on crude technical glycerin or glucose
   bubbled with either only air or air containing 2.5% (v/v) CO2. We found
   that CO2strongly influenced the production ofElliptochlorissp., as
   higher growth occurred in mixotrophy with CO2-enriched air compared to
   that with only air. Mixotrophy with CO2-enriched air allowed to reach
   higher biomass productivities and facilitated an increase in the
   relative abundance of saturated fatty acids. Nevertheless, mixotrophy
   with only air resulted in an increase of both saturated and unsaturated
   fatty acids, but biomass productivities were lower. These results, along
   with the limited biological contamination facilitated by low pH, suggest
   that this microalga might be attractive for large-scale production
   within the circular economy model.

TI Fourth generation biofuel: a review on risks and mitigation strategies.

PS 37-50
PY 2019
U1 11
U2 199
AB Fourth generation biofuel (FGB) uses genetically modified (GM) algae to
   enhance biofuel production. Although GM algae biofuel is a well-known
   alternative to fossil fuels, the potential environmental and
   health-related risks are still of great concern. An evaluation of these
   concerns and accordingly devising appropriate mitigation strategies to
   deal with them are important to a successful commercialized production
   of FGB. While extensive research has been carried out on genetic
   modification and other technologies that aim to increase the
   productivity of algae strains, only a handful of them deal with the
   legislative limitations imposed on exploiting and processing GM algae.
   This paper examines this legislation and the mitigation strategies to
   meet potential risks associated with the exploitation and processing of
   FGB. Open-pond system is an economic solution for large-scale
   cultivation of microalgae; however, the concern regarding the health and
   environmental risk of cultivating GM algae and the associated stringent
   regulations is considered as the main barrier of FGB production.
   Disposal of the residue is another important issue that should be
   considered in FGB production. The byproducts obtained from energy
   extraction step and residual water from the harvesting process may
   contain plasmid or chromosomal DNA that may cause the risk of lateral
   gene transfer. Hence an appropriate mitigation practices should be used
   for replacement of the hazardous water residue and by-products with more
   environmentally friendly alternatives. The results obtained from several
   field testing projects for open-environment exploitation of GM algae
   show that under the various conditions used, there was no apparent proof
   to support possible horizontal gene transfer in release of GM algae.

U1 0
U2 0
AB Microalgae are considered to be one of the most feasible options that
   have the potential to serve as a major feedstock for biofuels and
   bio-products production. However, the economic viability of commercial
   scale production remains questionable by many researchers and investors.
   There are several uncertainties in the technology for microalgae growing
   and harvesting, and the extraction of algal oil, which makes it
   difficult to identify the technology most suitable for minimizing cost
   and maximizing profits. Therefore, there is a need to carry out
   parametric analyses to identify the influence of system configuration
   and process on the economic viability. This study establishes an
   economic analysis for a microalgae oil production pathway to determine
   the minimum cost of producing algal oil. Taking the capital and
   operating costs parameters from the economic analysis, some of the key
   parameters are changed across a range of values and their influence on
   the final cost of algal oil is analysed. Each of the parameters is
   analysed across a range of production scale from 5 to 75 g/m2/d. The
   results show that the most important cost-driving parameters are the
   pond cost (especially the liners) and the harvesting costs, and that the
   costs can be reduced from  1.87/L to  1.58/L for a growth rate of 25
   g/m2/d and  1.34/L for a growth rate of 50 g/m2/d. This ultimately
   suggests that to achieve economic viability, improvements to cell
   biology (both growth rates and lipid content) and reducing systems unit
   costs while improving performance will be required together.

AB Chlorella sorokiniana(DOE 1412) emerged as one of the most promising
   microalgae strains from the NAABB consortium project and was found to
   have a remarkable doubling time under optimal conditions of 2.57 h-1.
   However, its maximum achievable annual biomass productivity in outdoor
   ponds in the contiguous USA has not yet been demonstrated. In order to
   address this knowledge gap, this alga was cultured in indoor LED-lighted
   and temperature-controlled raceways in nutrient replete freshwater
   (BG-11) medium at pH 7 under conditions simulating the daily sunlight
   intensity and water temperature fluctuations during three seasons in
   Southern Florida, an optimal outdoor pond culture location for this
   organism identified by prior biomass growth modeling. Prior strain
   characterization indicated that the average maximum specific growth rate
   (max) at 36°C declined continuously with pH, with maxcorresponding to
   5.92, 5.83, 4.89, and 4.21 day-1at pH 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. In
   addition, the maximum specific growth rate declined nearly linearly with
   increasing salinity until no growth was observed above 35 g L-1NaCl. In
   the climate-simulated culturing studies, the volumetric ash-free dry
   weight-based biomass productivities during the linear growth phase were
   57, 69, and 97 mg L-1day-1for 30-year averaged light and temperature
   simulations for January (winter), March (spring), and July (summer),
   respectively, which correspond to average areal productivities of 11.6,
   14.1, and 19.9 g m-2day-1. The photosynthetic efficiencies (PAR) in
   these three climate-simulated pond culturing experiments ranged from 4.1
   to 5.1%. The annual biomass productivity was estimated as ca. 15 g
   m-2day-1, nearly double the US Department of Energy (DOE) 2015 State of
   Technology annual cultivation productivity of 8.5 g m-2day-1, but still
   well below the projected DOE 2022 target of ca. 25 g m-2day-1required
   for economic microalgal biofuel production, indicating the need for
   additional research.

AB This study aims to determine the eco-friendliness of microalgae-based
   renewable energy production in several scenarios based on life cycle
   assessment (LCA). The LCA provides critical data for sustainable
   decision-making and energy requirement analysis, including net energy
   ratio (NER) and cumulative energy demand (CED). The Centrum voor
   Milieuwetenschappen Leiden (CML) IA-Baseline was used on environmental
   impact assessment method by SimaPro v9.3.0.3 software and energy
   analysis of biofuel production using native polyculture microalgae
   biomass in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) Bojongsoang,
   Bandung, Indonesia. The study was analyzed under three scenarios: (1)
   the current scenario; (2) the algae scenario without waste heat and
   carbon dioxide (CO2); and (3) the algae scenario with waste heat and
   carbon dioxide (CO2). Waste heat and CO2 were obtained from an
   industrial zone near the WWTP. The results disclosed that the microalgae
   scenario with waste heat and CO2 utilization is the most promising
   scenario with the lowest environmental impact (- 0.139 kg CO2eq/MJ),
   positive energy balance of 1.23 MJ/m3 wastewater (NER > 1), and lower
   CED value across various impact categories. It indicates that utilizing
   the waste heat and CO2 has a positive impact on energy efficiency. Based
   on the environmental impact, NER and CED values, this study suggests
   that the microalgae scenario with waste heat and CO2 is more feasible
   and sustainable to adopt and could be implemented at the Bojongsoang
   WWTP.

AB This study performs an environmental techno-economic assessment (ETEA)
   for multiple microalgae biorefinery concepts at different locations,
   those being Belgium and India. The ETEA methodology, which integrates
   aspects of the TEA and LCA methodologies and provides a clear framework
   for an integrated assessment model, has been proposed and discussed. The
   scenario in India has a higher profitability with a NPV of Euro 40
   million over a period of 10 years, while the environmental impact in
   Belgium is lower. The inclusion of a medium recycling step provides the
   best scenario from both perspectives. The crucial parameters for
   feasibility are the beta-carotene price and content, the upstream
   environmental impact of electricity and the maximum biomass
   concentration during cultivation. The identification of these parameters
   by the ETEA guides future technology developments and shortens the
   time-to-market for microalgal-based biorefineries.

AB The economic and environmental impacts of a commercial biodiesel
   production process using supercritical CO2 in lipid extraction and
   enzymatic transesterification from freeze-dried Nannochloropsis gaditana
   were assessed. The results were compared with those of compressed
   natural gas (CNG), which is employed as a transportation fuel in the
   United Arab Emirates (UAE). The total operation time considered in the
   techno-economic and environmental impact assessments was 16 years. To
   produce 1000 ton/y of biodiesel, the manufacturing costs and revenue
   were estimated to be $21,843,000/y and $27,940,000/y, respectively. The
   net present value of the profit, payback period, discounted payback
   period, and internal rate of return were estimated to be $8.31 million,
   9 years, 13 years, and 10.5%, respectively. An economic assessment
   indicated that producing biodiesel using the supercritical CO2 approach
   is profitable. Although the economics of CNG appeared more attractive,
   owing to the lower selling price and better consumption economy, the
   environmental impact of biodiesel production through supercritical CO2
   was 8 times smaller than that of CNG production. Reusing the produced
   biodiesel as an energy source in the production process and choosing a
   location close to the material source and capital items could further
   improve the economics and environmental impacts of the process.

AB To reduce CO2 emissions from alcoholic fermentation, Arthrospira
   platensis was cultivated in tubular photobioreactor using either urea or
   nitrate as nitrogen sources at different light intensities (60 mol m-2
   s-1≤I≤240 mol m-2 s-1). The type of carbon source (pure CO2 or CO2 from
   fermentation) did not show any appreciable influence on the main
   cultivation parameters, whereas substitution of nitrate for urea
   increased the nitrogen-to-cell conversion factor (YX/N), and the maximum
   cell concentration (Xm) and productivity (PX) increased with I. As a
   result, the best performance using gaseous emissions from alcoholic
   fermentation (Xm=2,96035 g m-3, P X=4255.9 g m-3 day-1 and YX/N=150.2 g
   g-1) was obtained at I=120 mol m-2 s-1 using urea as nitrogen source.
   The results obtained in this work demonstrate that the combined use of
   effluents rich in urea and carbon dioxide could be exploited in
   large-scale cyanobacteria cultivations to reduce not only the production
   costs of these photosynthetic microorganisms but also the environmental
   impact associated to the release of greenhouse emissions.

VL 196
PS 34-50
PY 2017
U1 7

AB Biomethane produced from seaweed is a third generation renewable gaseous
   fuel. The advantage of seaweed for biofuel is that it does not compete
   directly or indirectly for land with food, feed or fibre production.
   Furthermore, the integration of seaweed and salmon farming can increase
   the yield of seaweed per hectare, while reducing the eutrophication from
   fish farming. So far, full comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA)
   studies of seaweed biofuel are scarce in the literature; current studies
   focus mainly on microalgal biofuels. The focus of this study is an
   assessment of the sustainability of seaweed biomethane, with seaweed
   sourced from an integrated seaweed and salmon farm in a north Atlantic
   island, namely Ireland. With this goal in mind, an attributional LCA
   principle was applied to analyse a seaweed biofuel system. The
   environmental impact categories assessed are: climate change,
   acidification, and marine, terrestrial and freshwater eutrophication.
   The seaweedLaminaria digitatais digested to produce biogas upgraded to
   natural gas standard, before being used as a transport biofuel. The
   baseline scenario shows high emissions in all impact categories. An
   optimal seaweed biomethane system can achieve 70% savings in GHG
   emissions as compared to gasoline with high yields per hectare, optimum
   seaweed composition and proper digestate management. Seaweed harvested
   in August proved to have higher methane yield. August seaweed biomethane
   delivers 22% lower impacts than biomethane from seaweed harvested in
   October. Seaweed characteristics are more significant for improvement of
   biomethane sustainability than an increase in seaweed yield per unit
   area.

SO Journal of Industrial Ecology
VL 24

PS 205-216

U1 5
U2 32
AB Photosynthetic cyanobacteria have attracted interest as production
   organisms for third-generation biofuels, where sunlight and CO2 are used
   by microbes directly to synthesize fuel molecules. A particularly
   suitable biofuel is n-butanol, and there have been several laboratory
   reports of genetically engineered photosynthetic cyanobacteria capable
   of synthesizing and secreting n-butanol. This work evaluates the
   environmental impacts and cumulative energy demand (CED) of
   cyanobacteria-produced n-butanol through a cradle-to-grave consequential
   life cycle assessment (LCA). A hypothetical production plant in northern
   Sweden (area 1 ha, producing 5-85 m3n-butanol per year) was considered,
   and a range of cultivation formats and cellular productivity scenarios
   assessed. Depending on the scenario, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe)
   ranged from 16.9 to 58.6 gCO2eq/MJBuOH and the CED from 3.8 to 13
   MJ/MJBuOH. Only with the assumption of a nearby paper mill to supply
   waste sources for heat and CO2 was the sustainability requirement of at
   least 60% GHGe savings compared to fossil fuels reached, though
   placement in northern Sweden reduced energy needed for reactor cooling.
   A high CED in all scenarios shows that significant metabolic engineering
   is necessary, such as a carbon partitioning of >90% to n-butanol, as
   well as improved light utilization, to begin to displace fossil fuels or
   even first and second-generation bioethanol.

U2 411
AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a widely used technology to valorise food
   waste for biogas production yet a considerable amount of digestate
   remains under-utilised. Sustainable management and recycling of the
   nutrient-rich food waste anaerobic digestate (FWD) is highly desirable
   for closing resource loop and actualising circular economy. This work
   reviews the distinct properties of FWD and the existing treatment
   technologies. FWD shows great prospects as a nutrient source for
   microalgal cultivation and biofuel production. Emerging technologies
   such as thermal conversion (e.g., pyrolysis and hydrothermal treatment)
   of FWD into value-added products such as functionalised
   biochar/hydrochar with diverse applications would be attractive and
   warrant further research investigation. Integrated AD with subsequent
   valorisation facilities is highly encouraged to achieve complete
   utilisation of resources and reduce carbon emissions.

   (CSA). Optimal conditions resulted in a microalgae methyl ester yield of
   97.55%. The effects of a novel ternary blend of diethyl-ether and
   microalgae oil methyl ester with diesel on engine performance and
   emission characteristics were also investigated. Results showed that the
   ternary fuel blend (B20DEE10) improved engine performance and reduced
   emissions by 10%-30% compared to diesel. The study provides valuable
   insights into biodiesel production optimisation and the blending of
   novel ternary fuels for reducing environmental pollution and improving

AB Anaerobic digestion produces biogas and digestate containing CO2and
   volatile fatty acids, respectively that might need to be removed if they
   are to be used or discharged. Algae cultivation would remove the carbon
   in biogas and digestate. The present work used a textile desizing
   wastewater digester's biogas and digestate effluent to cultivate
   microalgaeScenedesmussp. The tested biogas CO2and digestate chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) concentrations were 22% and 3-7 g L-1, respectively.
   It is shown thatScenedesmussp. could simultaneously assimilate biogas
   CO2and organic carbon in the digestate. A digestate concentration of 5 g
   COD L-1resulted in peak algal biomass concentration, COD removal and
   bio-CO2fixation efficiency with values of 1.79 g L-1, 69.1% and 98.2%,
   respectively in 10 day algae cultivation. Based on the experimental
   results, a diagram was proposed to show a wastewater treatment to give
   an algae and methane bioenergy production concept as an example of
   circular economy.

AB The 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is important to produce bio-nylon 4 in
   biorefineries. First, a glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) was propagated in
   three differentEscherichia colistrains to achieve 100% conversion from 1
   M monosodium glutamate after optimization of the process. To make the
   process greener and more efficient, in situ CO2adaptation and citrate
   feeding strategies to maintain the optimal pH value and 498 g/L of GABA
   was obtained. However, the process releases the equivalent amount of
   CO2. Therefore, CO2generated from GABA production was completely
   sequestered in sodium hydroxide to form bicarbonate and applied in a
   coupling culture ofChlorella sorokiniana(CS) orChlorella vulgaris(CV) to
   increase the biomass when combined with sodium bicarbonate and carbonic
   anhydrase. Further improvement of 1.65-fold biomass and 1.43-fold lipid
   content were occurred when supplying GABA to the culture. This
   integrative process provided the highest GABA production rate without
   CO2release, forming an eco-friendly and carbon-neutral technology.

AB The population explosion and rapid urbanization currently being
   experienced in both the developed and developing economies of the world
   calls for enormous quantities of fuel and this high rate of fuel
   consumption is heavily dependent upon conventional non-renewable energy
   resources. It is well known that these conventional resources would be
   extinguished in the near future and moreover cause a lot of problems
   related to pollution, climatic changes, etc. To tackle this precarious
   energy deficit scenario and to reduce the negative environmental
   impacts, alternative fuels from renewable energy sources are gaining
   more and more attention. Biofuel, an alternate renewable fuel, is
   derived usually from biodegradable feedstock like vegetable oils, animal
   fats, etc. However, various kinds of protein based waste products can
   also be utilized for the production of biofuels, which has an added
   advantage of minimizing waste and reducing environmental pollution.
   Proteins are large macromolecules consisting of one or more long chain
   amino acids. This review paper focuses on cost effective technologies
   and processes particularly focusing on the utilization of protein rich
   biomass and pyrolysis to convert biomass into useful liquid biofuels and
   by-products. Pyrolysis is a process in which the waste materials are
   burned in the absence of oxygen or air at elevated temperatures which
   results in the thermal cracking of long chain protein molecules into
   smaller sub chains. A few studies suggests that pyrolysis of
   protein-rich microalgae can also produce bio-oil that, in some respects,
   is superior to bio-oil from lignocellulosic biomass. It was also
   reported that bio-oil from microalgae was characterized by lower oxygen
   content and a higher heating value than bio-oil from lignocellulosic
   biomass. Studies conducted by Miao et al. reported bio-oil yields of
   18%, 24% and 57.9% for pyrolysis ofChlorella protothecoides, Microcystis
   aeruginosa and heterotrophicC. protothecoides, respectively. In this
   review paper an analytical study on the pyrolysis of high protein
   content biomass is performed on the basis of a number of studies.

AB Microalgae are widely recognized for their capacity to generate
   value-added products in a variety of sectors, including the
   pharmaceutical and food industries, bioenergy industries and wastewater
   industries. The quality of a microalga is significantly influenced by
   its proliferation. Along with growth, the biochemical profile may also
   vary based on the nutrient that is supplemented. The majority of the
   supplemented nutrients utilized are not in a functional state, as they
   are typically extracted in liquid form or pretreated prior to use.
   Parallel to numerous commonly applied pretreatment processes, including
   chemical, mechanical and biological, thermal pretreatment appears to
   receive less attention. Hence it is crucial to comprehend the potential
   for thermal pretreatment as well as its mechanism in militating the
   solid waste to release additional nutrients in order to enhance the
   biochemical profile of microalgae. The current review takes a closer
   look at the impact of various thermal pretreatments on solid waste on
   influencing microalgal performance in terms of their overall biochemical
   profiles such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. This approach is
   likely to enhance the circular economy by utilizing waste products and
   effectively closing the loop on waste.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a valuable tool for determining the
   environmental impacts associated with different products and has been
   widely used to assess biofuel production. As a scientific methodology
   rather than a standardized test, every LCA may be thought of as unique
   in terms of the selection of functional units or determination of system
   boundaries. Researchers generally tailor the method to meet the specific
   goals of their own investigations. This review examines a number of LCAs
   used to evaluate microalgae-to-energy systems, and evaluates their
   contributions in terms of their ability to support commercialization
   efforts in this sector. To this end, a new scoring system for LCAs is
   proposed based on input/output flows, data origin, production
   technologies and system boundaries, selection of assumptions and
   variables, as well as the ability to track environmental, economic, and
   social impacts. The review suggests that, while a wide variety of new
   technological pathways for microalgae-to-energy systems are being
   assessed, the majority of studies reported employ relatively limited
   system boundaries that may not capture the full impacts of the
   processes. The number of environmental impact factors being tracked is
   limited, and many studies do not consider important impacts such as
   water or land use. Most studies do not incorporate critical information
   about economics related to new process configurations, which will be
   essential to support commercialization efforts in this area.

AB The interest in microalgae as a renewable and sustainable feedstock for
   biofuels production has inspired a new focus in biorefinery. Current
   innovations in microalgae technology include the use of wastewater as
   the cultivation medium towards nutrients recovery, renewable energy
   generation, as well as wastewater treatment. Though recent studies have
   favoured the competitiveness of such an approach, how to maintain a
   high-quality microalgae-derived biofuel production in real wastewater
   with fluctuations in nutrient contents is still a challenge. This study
   investigated a strategy of adjusting the nutrient composition of the
   feeding wastewater (i.e. anaerobic digestion effluent) for microalgae
   cultivation (Desmodesmussp.) and biofuel production. The addition of an
   appropriate amount of nutrients, including magnesium, iron and
   phosphorus, significantly enhanced the microalgal biomass production
   (0.78 g L-1) compared with the original wastewater (0.35 g L-1) and the
   standard BG11 microalgae cultivation medium (0.54 g L-1). In terms of
   the potential biofuel quality, the use of adjusted wastewater led to a
   higher content of valuable products (aliphatic hydrocarbon and fatty
   acids were accounted for 23.98% and 42.33% of the whole biomass,
   respectively) along with a reduction in potentially toxic substances
   (nitrogen-containing compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were
   accounted for 7.96% and 7.09% of the whole biomass, respectively)
   compared with the other cultivation groups. Moreover, the lower optimal
   temperature of pyrolysis engendered by the adjusted wastewater was
   significant for reduction of process energy consumption, which in turn
   led to overall lowered environmental impacts (838.52 mPET2000, applying
   life cycle assessment) than did the original wastewater (1165.67
   mPET2000) and standard cultivation medium (1347.63 mPET2000). This study
   demonstrated that the adjustment of wastewater can act as a potential
   approach for the improvement in the quality of microalgal biofuel
   production, with consequent reduced environmental impacts.

AB The environmental sustainability of the microalgaeNannochloropsis
   oceanicacultivation for total fatty acid (TFA) production was analyzed
   using life cycle assessment (LCA). Pilot data provided by the plant
   operator from cultivation in Italy using Green Wall Panel (GWP)
   photobioreactors were upscaled to a 20-ha production process, and an LCA
   was conducted and assessed for the Italian regions of Tuscany and
   Sicily. Two additional scenarios were modelled to analyze the influence
   of more sustainable framework conditions, respectively nutrient
   recycling and renewable energy supply. The results show that
   environmental impacts per functional unit are around 15% less at the
   site with optimal growth conditions. Between 60 and 80% of the impacts
   are due to the energy demand during plant operation, infrastructure, and
   nutrient demand. Nutrient recycling and the gain of an energy credit
   from the separated biocrude with the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)
   process reduce the environmental impacts in all six International
   Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) impact categories by an average
   of 11% compared to a scenario without nutrient recycling. The additional
   consideration of a renewable energy supply allows for an average
   reduction of 36% and together with the nutrient recycling of an average
   of 45% for the global warming potential (GWP) and most of the other
   impact categories.

AB The implementation of a sustainable bio-based economy is considered a
   top priority today. There is no doubt about the necessity to produce
   renewable bioenergy and bio-sourced chemicals to replace fossil-derived
   compounds. Under this scenario, strong efforts have been devoted to
   efficiently use organic waste as feedstock for biohydrogen production
   via dark fermentation. However, the technoeconomic viability of this
   process needs to be enhanced by the valorization of the residual streams
   generated. The use of dark fermentation effluents as low-cost carbon
   source for microalgae cultivation arises as an innovative approach for
   bioproducts generation (e.g., biodiesel, bioactive compounds, pigments)
   that maximizes the carbon recovery. In a biorefinery context, after
   value-added product extraction, the spent microalgae biomass can be
   further valorised as feedstock for biohydrogen production. This
   integrated process would play a key role in the transition towards a
   circular economy. This review covers recent advances in microalgal
   cultivation on dark fermentation effluents (DFE). BioH2via dark
   fermentation processes and the involved metabolic pathways are detailed
   with a special focus on the main aspects affecting the effluent
   composition. Interesting traits of microalgae and current approaches to
   solve the challenges associated to the integration of dark fermentation
   and microalgae cultivation are also discussed.

U1 1
U2 7
AB This study quantifies the financial and environmental impacts of a
   microalgal bioenergy system that attempts to maximize circular flows by
   recovering and reusing the carbon, nutrients, and water within the
   system. The system produces microalgal biomass using liquid digestate of
   an anaerobic digester that processes 45 metric tons of food waste and
   generates 28.6 m3 of permeate daily in California, and three energy
   production scenarios from the biomass are considered: producing
   biodiesel, electricity, and both. In all scenarios, the resulting energy
   products delivered only modest reductions in environmental impacts as
   measured by carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The carbon intensities
   (CIs) of biodiesel from this study were 91.0 gCO2e/MJ and 93.3 gCO2e/MJ,
   which were lower than 94.71 gCO2e/MJ of conventional petroleum diesel,
   and the CI of electricity from this study was 70.6 gCO2e/MJ, lower than
   the average electricity grid CI in California (82.92 gCO2e/MJ). The
   economic analysis results show that generating electricity alone can be
   profitable, while biodiesel produced via this system is not cost
   competitive with conventional diesel due to high capital expenses. Thus,
   generating electricity in lieu of biodiesel appears to be a better
   option to maximize the use of waste flows and supply lower-carbon
   energy.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the potential environmental impacts
   associated with microalgae systems for wastewater treatment and
   bioproducts recovery. In this sense, a Life Cycle Assessment was carried
   out evaluating two systems treating (i) urban wastewater and (ii)
   industrial wastewater (from a food industry), with the recovery of
   bioproducts (i.e. natural pigments and biofertilizer) and bioenergy
   (i.e. biogas). Additionally, both alternatives were compared to (iii) a
   conventional system using a standard growth medium for microalgae
   cultivation in order to show the potential benefits of using wastewater
   compared to typical cultivation approaches. The results indicated that
   the system treating industrial wastewater with unialgal culture had
   lower environmental impacts than the system treating urban wastewater
   with mixed cultures. Bioproducts recovery from microalgae wastewater
   treatment systems can reduce the environmental impacts up to 5 times
   compared to a conventional system using a standard growth medium. This
   was mainly due to the lower chemicals consumption for microalgae
   cultivation. Food-industry effluent showed to be the most promising
   scenario for bioproducts recovery from microalgae treating wastewater,
   because of its better quality compared to urban wastewater which also
   allows the cultivation of a single microalgae species. In conclusion,
   microalgae wastewater treatment systems are a promising solution not
   only for wastewater treatment but also to boost the circular bioeconomy
   in the water sector through microalgae-based product recovery.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for converting
   organic wastes into bio-crude oil, with organic-rich post-hydrothermal
   liquefaction wastewater (PHWW) as by-product. In this study, zeolite
   adsorption and anaerobic digestion (AD) were integrated to improve the
   methane production and energy recovery of PHWW from Chlorella 1067. A
   statistical design for maximum toxicants removal by zeolite was applied
   before AD process. Zeolite could mitigate the inhibition associated to
   compounds such as ammonia, N-heterocyclic compounds, etc. in PHWW and
   thereby shortening the lag phase and increasing methane production by
   32-117% compared with that without zeolite adsorption. Zeolite
   adsorption also increased energy recovery efficiency (up to 70.5%) for
   this integrated system. Integration of HTL and AD brought higher
   energetic return from feedstock via oil and biomethane production, which
   may offer insight into industrial application of microalgae biomass in
   the circular economy. In addition, carbon and nitrogen flow for the
   integrated process was determined.

AB A microalgae-based energy system, which is a combination of different
   microalgae-to-biodiesel chains and an integrated cogasification combined
   cycle (ICGCC) system, is presented. To address the low environmental
   impacts, the electricity is generated from ICGCC to meet the load demand
   from the microalgae-to-biodiesel chains and the flue gas exits from
   ICGCC to meet the demand of growing algal culture. To achieve the
   microalgae-based energy system with minimum life cycle greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions, the first step is to develop the superstructure model
   based on GAMS, the second step is to use the optimal heat exchanger
   network to maximize the heat recovery of ICGCC, and the third step is to
   find the optimal combination of the microalgae-to-biodiesel chain and
   optimal operating conditions of ICGCC by solving the global optimization
   of nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. For
   the scope of well-to-tank (WTT), the optimal microalgae-based energy
   system reduces 16.80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to the
   other reported microalgae-to-biodiesel chains. For the scope of
   well-to-wheel (WTW), the optimal microalgae-based energy system reduces
   45.77% GHG emissions compared to the conventional diesel process.

AB Background: Microalgae are 10 to 20 times more productive than the
   current agricultural biodiesel producing oleaginous crops. However, they
   require larger energy supplies, so that their environmental impacts
   remain uncertain, as illustrated by the contradictory results in the
   literature. Besides, solar radiation is often too high relative to the
   photosynthetic capacity of microalgae. This leads to photosaturation,
   photoinhibition, overheating and eventually induces mortality. Shadowing
   microalgae with solar panels would, therefore, be a promising solution
   for both increasing productivity during hotter periods and producing
   local electricity for the process. The main objective of this study is
   to measure, via LCA framework, the energy performance and environmental
   impact of microalgae biodiesel produced in a solar greenhouse,
   alternating optimal microalgae species and photovoltaic panel (PV)
   coverage. A mathematical model is simulated to investigate the
   microalgae productivity in raceways under meteorological conditions in
   Sophia Antipolis (south of France) at variable coverture percentages (0%
   to 90%) of CIGS solar panels on greenhouses constructed with
   low-emissivity (low-E) glass. Results: A trade-off must be met between
   electricity and biomass production, as a larger photovoltaic coverture
   would limit microalgae production. From an energetic point of view, the
   optimal configuration lies between 10 and 20% of PV coverage.
   Nevertheless, from an environmental point of view, the best option is
   50% PV coverage. However, the difference between impact assessments
   obtained for 20% and 50% PV is negligible, while the NER is 48% higher
   for 20% PV than for 50% PV coverage. Hence, a 20% coverture of
   photovoltaic panels is the best scenario from an energetic and
   environmental point of view. Conclusions: In comparison with the
   cultivation of microalgae without PV, the use of photovoltaic panels
   triggers a synergetic effect, sourcing local electricity and reducing
   climate change impacts. Considering an economic approach, low
   photovoltaic panel coverage would probably be more attractive. However,
   even with a 10% area of photovoltaic panels, the environmental footprint
   would already significantly decrease. It is expected that significant
   improvements in microalgae productivity or more advanced production
   processes should rapidly enhance these performances.

TI Co-digestion of sewage sludge and microalgae - biogas production
   investigations.
SO Applied Energy
VL 227
PS 64-72
PY 2018
U1 1
U2 85
AB In municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), algae could be
   utilised for cleaning the water and, at the same time, produce a biomass
   that can be used for energy. Through anaerobic digestion, microalgae can
   contribute to biogas production when co-digested with sewage sludge. In
   this paper, previous published results on the co-digestion of sewage
   sludge and microalgae are summarised and reviewed, and any remaining
   knowledge gaps are identified. The batch tests currently documented in
   literature mostly concern digestion under mesophilic conditions, and
   studies investigating thermophilic conditions are less common. The
   average biochemical methane potential (BMP) for 29 different mixtures
   co-digested under mesophilic conditions is 317101 N cm3 CH4 gVS-1 while
   the result for 12 different mixtures investigated under thermophilic
   conditions is a BMP of 31860 N cm3 CH4 gVS-1. An evaluation of the heat
   required for increasing the temperature from mesophilic to thermophilic
   conditions shows that increased methane production under thermophilic
   conditions can be enough to create a positive energy balance. For a
   full-scale WWTP, using thermophilic digestion on sludge, or a
   combination of sludge and microalgae could therefore be of interest.
   This is dependent on the demands on sanitation of the sludge and the
   possibilities for heat recovery. Most of the mesophilic investigations
   indicate a synergetic effect for co-digestion, with enhancements of up
   to almost 70%. However, the results are uncertain since the standard
   deviations for some of the BMP tests are in the same order of magnitude
   as the identified enhancement. Neither of the presented publications
   provide an understanding of the basic mechanisms that led to higher or
   lower BMP when microalgae were mixed with wastewater sludge. We,
   therefore, call for care to be taken when assuming any effects related
   to the specification of substrates. Microalgae and wastewater sludge
   have several similarities, and the specific results of BMP in the
   mixtures relate more to the specifics of the respective materials than
   the materials themselves. Investigations into semi-continuous processes
   of co-digestion of microalgae and sludge are scarce. The yields for
   three co-digestion studies show high variation, with an average of
   293112 N cm3 gVSin-1. The available results show strong potential for
   co-digestion of sewage sludge and microalgae. Further investigations are
   required to identify optimal conditions for biogas production, and
   analysis of microalgae implementation on wastewater treatment at a
   system level is also needed to identify the total mass balance of
   substrate and nutrient recovery.

AB Microalgal biomass is a renewable energy source and is considered as a
   crucial solution in the increasing energy demand and greenhouse gas
   emissions. Through various thermochemical conversion processes such as
   torrefaction, pyrolysis, liquefaction, and gasification, biomass can be
   converted to different bioenergy products. However, the production of
   these bioenergy products through the aforesaid thermochemical processes
   entails raw material consumption, energy consumption, and environmental
   impact. A multitude of studies has been conducted to evaluate the
   environmental impact of bioenergy products for specific thermochemical
   processes on a specific biomass feedstock using life cycle assessment.
   This study aims to comprehensively review the life cycle assessment of
   bioenergy products from microalgal biomass together with lignocellulosic
   biomass and through different thermochemical processes. The study
   identifies the current challenges and potential future works of
   bioenergy production from different thermochemical processes in the
   perspective of a life cycle assessment framework.

VL 9

U1 5
U2 26
AB Sugarcane ethanol production generates about 360 billion liters of
   vinasse, a liquid effluent with an average chemical oxygen demand of
   46,000 mg/L. Vinasse still contains about 11% of the original energy
   from sugarcane juice, but this chemical energy is diluted. This residue,
   usually discarded or applied in fertigation, is a suitable substrate for
   anaerobic digestion (AD). Although the technology is not yet widespread
   - only 3% of bioethanol plants used it in Brazil in the past, most
   discontinuing the process - the research continues. With a biomethane
   potential ranging from 215 to 324 L of methane produced by kilogram of
   organic matter in vinasse, AD could improve the energy output of
   sugarcane biorefineries. At the same time, the residual digestate could
   still be used as an agricultural amendment or for microalgal production
   for further stream valorization. This review presents the current
   technology for ethanol production from sugarcane and describes the state
   of the art in vinasse AD, including technological trends, through a
   recent patent evaluation. It also appraises the integration of vinasse
   AD in an ideal sugarcane biorefinery approach. It finally discusses
   bottlenecks and presents possible directions for technology development
   and widespread adoption of this simple yet powerful approach for
   bioresource recovery.

AB The entire life cycle of biodiesel produced by microalgal biomasses was
   evaluated using the method of life cycle assessment (LCA) to identify
   and quantify the fossil energy requirements and environmental impact
   loading of the system. The life cycle considers microalgae cultivation,
   harvesting, drying, oil extraction, anaerobic digestion, oil
   transportation, esterification, biodiesel transportation and biodiesel
   combustion. The investigation results show that the fossil energy
   requirement for the biodiesel production is 0.74 MJ/MJ biodiesel,
   indicating that 1 MJ of biodiesel requires an input of 0.74 MJ of fossil
   energy. Accordingly, biodiesel production is feasible as an energy
   producing process. The environmental impact loading of microalgal
   biodiesel is 3.69 PET2010(Person Equivalents, Targeted, in 2010) and the
   GWP is 0.16 kg CO2-eq/MJ biodiesel. The effects of photochemical ozone
   formation were greatest among all calculated categorization impacts. The
   fossil energy requirement and GWP in this operation were found to be
   particularly sensitive to oil content, drying rate and esterification
   rate. Overall, the results presented herein indicate that the
   cultivation of microalgae has the potential to produce an
   environmentally sustainable feedstock for the production of biodiesel.

AB Microalgae cultivation is considered fit to the concept of green
   economy, in which greenhouse gases (GHG's) mitigation and production of
   valuable substances is performed simultaneously. Carbon dioxide
   consumption by the algal cells reduces GHG's emission to the atmosphere,
   while biomass conversion to biofuel feedstock supports the concept of
   circular economy of microalgae cultivation process. In this
   study,Chlorellasp. was cultivated in a Multi Tubular Airlift
   Photobioreactor (MTAP) system with a total volume of about 600 L. The
   result of a thirteen days batch culture showed the ability of the system
   to fix 1.57 g CO2L-1day-1. At the last day of experiment, 600 L MTAP
   showed biomass production of 0.35 g L-1and 18% oil from cell dry weight
   was observed. This research showed the ability of 600 L MTAP to absorb
   942 g CO2and produce 37.8 g oil as biofuel feedstock. Compared to other
   experiments, percentage of oil in this experiment (18% from cell dry
   weight) was in the average range from other experiments (of about 10 -
   40% from cell dry weight). However, this MTAP showed higher performance
   than other systems (mostly below 1 g CO2L-1day-1) in CO2fixation rate.

AB Algae have the potential to be used as a feedstock for the synthesis of
   valuable compounds and biofuels. In addition, algal waste can be further
   transformed into biofuel, biogas, and biochar using different
   thermochemical processes such as microwave pyrolysis, pyrolysis,
   torrefaction, and hydrothermal conversion. Due to its high specific
   surface area, rapid electron transport, and graphitic carbon structure,
   algal biochar carbonized at high temperatures has shown outstanding
   performance for applications as CO2adsorbents, supercapacitors, and
   persulfate activation. Due to the combination of various functional
   groups and porous structures, the algae biomass pyrolysis at a moderate
   temperature produced high-quality biochar that shows high performance in
   terms of pollutant removal, while low-temperature pyrolysis produces
   coal fuel from algae via torrefaction. Over time, there have been
   exponentially more petroleum-based polymers created that have harmful
   impacts on both humans and the environment. As a result, researchers are
   becoming more interested in algae-based biopolymers as a potential
   alternative strategy for establishing a sustainable circular economy
   globally. The advantages of microalgal biopolymer over other feedstocks
   are its capacity to compost, which provides greenhouse gas credits, its
   quick growth ability with flexibility in a variety of settings, and its
   ability to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Humanity is facing some major global threats, namely lack of
   environmental sustainability, the energy crisis associated with the
   unsustainable reliance on fossil fuels, and water scarcity, which will
   be exacerbated with the rapid growth of urban areas. Researchers have
   drawn their attention to microalgae, photosynthetic microorganisms known
   for their environmental applications, such as wastewater remediation and
   lipids accumulation, to produce third-generation biofuels to solve some
   of these major issues. Considering this dual role, this study evaluated
   the potential of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris on nutrient removal
   from a paper industry effluent and bioenergy production. Firstly,
   experiments were performed to assess the potential of this microalga to:
   (i) successfully grow in different concentrations of a paper industry
   effluent (20% to 100%); and (ii) treat the industrial effluent, reducing
   phosphorus concentrations to values below the accepted legal limits.
   Then, a techno-economic assessment was performed to study the viability
   of a C. vulgaris biorefinery targeting the remediation of a paper
   industry effluent and bioenergy production. The results have shown that
   C. vulgaris was able to successfully grow and treat the paper industry
   effluent. Under these conditions, average biomass productivities
   determined for this microalga ranged between 15.5  0.5 and 26  1 mg dry
   weight (DW) L-1 d-1, with maximum biomass concentrations reaching values
   between 337  9 and 495  25 mg DW L-1 d-1. Moreover, final phosphorus
   concentrations ranged between 0.12  0.01 and 0.5  0.3 mg P L-1, values
   below the legal limits imposed by the Portuguese Environment Agency on
   the paper industry. Regarding the proposal of a microalgal biorefinery
   for the bioremediation of paper industry effluents with bioenergy
   production, the techno-economic study demonstrated that six of the seven
   studied scenarios resulted in an economically-viable infrastructure. The
   highest net present value (15.4 million euros) and lowest discounted
   payback period (13 years) were determined for Scenario 3, which assumed
   a photosynthetic efficiency of 3%, a lipids extraction efficiency of
   75%, and an anaerobic digestion efficiency of 45%. Therefore, it was
   possible to conclude that besides being economically viable, the
   proposed biorefinery presents several environmental benefits: (i) the
   remediation of an industrial effluent; (ii) CO2 uptake for microalgal
   growth, which contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions;
   (iii) production of clean and renewable energy; (iv) soil regeneration;
   and (v) promotion of a circular economy.

TI Comparative life cycle assessment of heterotrophic

SO Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene

AB Fish oil is primarily extracted from small marine pelagic fishes,
   reducing their availability for marine wildlife forage and artisanal
   fishing catches that support food security in lower income coastal
   nations. A primary use of fish oil is in feeds for aquaculture, the
   world's fastest growing food sector. Efforts to transition fed
   aquaculture to sustainability includes replacing fish oil in aquafeeds
   with more environmentally responsible alternative ingredients. The
   heterotrophic marine microalga Schizochytrium sp., one of the first
   commercialized alternatives, lacks an open-access, systematic analysis
   of environmental impacts of substituting fish oil with heterotrophic
   microalgae from biorefineries. This study compared the "cradle to
   factory-gate" life cycle impacts of fish oil to whole-cell or extracted
   oil of Schizochytrium combined with canola oil.We conducted an
   attributional life cycle assessment using inventory data collected from
   published literature and patents and received feedback on commercial
   relevance of model assumptions from industry advisors. We examined sugar
   from a Brazilian sugarcane biorefinery and sucrose from U.S. sugar beets
   as feedstocks for heterotrophic cultivation of Schizochytrium; and
   compared life cycle impacts of extracting Schizochytrium oil using
   solvent-free microwave extraction to conventional solvent extraction.
   Results were that: cultivation processes had the largest overall effect
   for both products in both regions; whole-cell Schizochytrium combined
   with canola oil had significantly lower environmental impacts, in all
   assessed categories, than Schizochytrium oil blended with canola oil;
   and conventional solvent extraction had significantly lower
   environmental impacts compared to solvent-free microwave extraction
   except global warming potential. Schizochytrium products, compared to
   fish oil, had substantially lower biotic resource depletion and, in the
   case of whole cells combined with canola oil, had significantly lower
   global warming potential but higher impacts for all other categories,
   primarily because commercial Schizochytrium production used sugar
   feedstocks as carbon and energy sources. The mix of lower and higher
   environmental impacts of Schizochytrium products illustrates the
   importance of openly identifying environmental tradeoffs to inform
   evidence-based decisions for commercial practices. Environmental impacts
   should also be weighed against potential human health benefits of
   maintaining omega-3 fatty acids and avoiding contaminants in fish flesh
   when considering alternatives to fish oil.

AB In the next twenty years, the scarcity of food shortage and drinking
   water will appear in Egypt due to the growth of industries and
   agriculture. This paper develops a conceptual design of the new
   technologies in the field of water-energy-food in new cities. Border
   lines are the internal relationship, external influence, and linkage
   system evaluation for WEF nexus. The major problems of using fossil
   energy in desalination are emissions and non-renewability, as well as
   the preference for dispersed freshwater production instead of
   concentrated output. The design of a desalination system that is
   integrated with renewable energies is critical these days. This type of
   system can also reduce the production of environmental pollutants due to
   reduced energy consumption and transfer of freshwater. GIS data from the
   United Nations have confirmed the existence of an underground reservoir
   in Wadi-Dara that can cultivate 1000 acres using smart farming
   techniques to reach a circular economy for an integrated solution
   between the water-energy nexus. The possibility of cultivating a hundred
   acres in Wadi-Dara on the Red Sea coast exists, through which about one
   million people could be settled. In this comprehensive review, we
   conducted a deep study in order to establish a sustainable integrated
   lifestyle in the Dara Valley region in terms of the availability of
   potable water, clean energy, and agriculture. Sustainable integrated
   solutions were conducted for seawater desalination using beach sand
   filtration wells as a pretreatment for seawater using renewable energy,
   e.g., wind energy (18% wind turbines), and photovoltaic panels (77% PV
   panels). Strategic food will be cultivated using smart farming that
   includes an open ponds cultivation system of microalgal cells to
   synthesis 5.0% of bio-fuel . Aqua agriculture and aquaponics will
   cultivate marine culture and integrate mangrove, a shrimp aquaculture. A
   municipal waste water treatment is conceived for the irrigation of
   shrubby forests and landscapes. Mixotrophic cultures were explored to
   achieve a sustained ecological balance. Food, poultry and animal waste
   management, as well as a cooker factory, were included in the overall
   design. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) study shows a low risk
   due to anticipated net zero emissions, a 75% green city, and optimal
   waste recycling. This research assists in combining research efforts to
   address the challenging processes in nexus research and build resilient
   and sustainable water, energy, and food systems.

AB Every day, large quantities of wastewater are discharged from various
   sources that could be reused. Wastewater contains nutrients such as
   nitrogen or phosphorus, which can be recovered. Microalgae-based
   technologies have attracted attention in this sector, as they are able
   to bioremediate wastewater, harnessing its nutrients and generating
   algal biomass useful for different downstream uses, as well as having
   other advantages. There are multiple species of microalgae capable of
   growing in wastewater, achieving nutrient removal efficiencies
   surpassing 70%. On the other hand, microalgae contain lipids that can be
   extracted for energy recovery in biodiesel. Currently, there are several
   methods of lipid extraction from microalgae. Other biofuels can also be
   obtained from microalgae biomass, such as bioethanol, biohydrogen or
   biogas. This review also provides information on bioenergy products and
   products in the agri-food industry as well as in the field of human

U1 16
U2 80
AB The intensification of agricultural production in response to the global
   population increase and the growing demand for food has raised
   significant concerns regarding environmental impacts over the past few
   decades. Currently, modern agriculture aims to improve the quantity and
   quality of crop yield, minimizing the negative effects of treatments on
   the environment. Recently, microalgae have found extensive application
   as a valuable biological resource across multiple industries, including
   the food sector, biofuel production, and the pharmaceutical industry. In
   agriculture, microalgae have been seen as a promising and sustainable
   alternative to agrochemicals, offering a range of benefits to improve
   soil fertility, optimize nutrient management, and reduce reliance on
   synthetic fertilizers. In general, microalgae have demonstrated
   efficient nutrient cycling abilities, assimilating and converting
   essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, into
   forms readily available for plants. Additionally, they produce bioactive
   substances, including phytohormones, which have a direct impact on the
   physiological processes of plants and promote their growth. Microalgae
   can also establish beneficial interactions with other soil
   microorganisms, supporting the growth of beneficial bacteria and fungi,
   thus promoting a healthy soil microbiome. On the other hand, as
   photosynthetic microorganisms, microalgae harness sunlight to convert
   carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic matter through photosynthesis. This
   ability allows them to sequester carbon and contribute to sustainable
   agriculture by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The present work
   provides an overview of the potential of microalgae as biofertilizers,
   highlighting their unique characteristics, benefits, and main
   limitations for effective implementation in agriculturally sustainable
   practices.

AB Production of biofuels and bioenergy precursors by phototrophic
   microorganisms, such as microalgae and cyanobacteria, is a promising
   alternative to conventional fuels obtained from non-renewable resources.
   Several species of microalgae have been investigated as potential
   candidates for the production of biofuels, for the most part due to
   their exceptional metabolic capability to accumulate large quantities of
   lipids. Constraint-based modeling, a systems biology approach that
   accurately predicts the metabolic phenotype of phototrophs, has been
   deployed to identify suitable culture conditions as well as to explore
   genetic enhancement strategies for bioproduction. Core metabolic models
   were employed to gain insight into the central carbon metabolism in
   photosynthetic microorganisms. More recently, comprehensive genome-scale
   models, including organelle-specific information at high resolution,
   have been developed to gain new insight into the metabolism of
   phototrophic cell factories. Here, we review the current state of the
   art of constraint-based modeling and computational method development
   and discuss how advanced models led to increased prediction accuracy and
   thus improved lipid production in microalgae.

AB Microalgae stand out as a valuable source of carotenoids, with potential
   applications in various industrial sectors. Cultivating microalgae in
   wastewater emerges as an alternative to mitigate the high costs
   associated with the synthetic production of these compounds while
   contributing to sanitation resource recovery. Previous studies
   demonstrated the potential for obtaining lutein and betacarotene from
   biomass cultivated in domestic sewage and agro-industrial effluent. This
   study conducted comprehensive economic and life cycle analyses to
   evaluate cultivation reactors (high-rate pond and hybrid system) and
   extraction methods (ethyl acetate solvent and supercritical fluid) to
   acquire 1 kg of carotenoids efficiently. For all evaluated scenarios,
   higher environmental impacts were observed in the Human carcinogenic
   toxicity category and human health environmental damage associated with
   ethyl acetate and electricity consumption. Ethyl acetate also stood out
   with higher costs. The high-rate pond and hybrid system showed similar
   environmental impacts in scenarios with ethyl acetate extraction;
   however, when supercritical fluid was used, cultivation in the first
   reactor resulted in 2.2-6.2 times lower environmental impacts in
   Midpoint categories. Regarding the extraction method, the use of
   supercritical fluid demonstrated superior economic and environmental
   performance despite registering a 53% higher energy consumption than
   solvent extraction. Thus, for the viability of obtaining carotenoids
   from microalgae biomass, we recommend that two-stage cultivation
   approaches, incorporating solvent recovery steps and biomass
   valorization in a cascade manner within a biorefinery context, be
   considered in future studies.

AB With modern genetic engineering tools, microorganisms can become
   resilient green cell factories to produce sustainable biofuels directly.
   Compared to non-engineered algae and cyanobacteria, the photon
   conversion efficiency can be significantly increased. Furthermore,
   simplified harvesting processes are feasible since the novel
   microorganisms are excreting the biofuels or their precursors
   continuously and directly into the cultivation media. Along with higher
   productivity and direct product harvesting, it is expected that
   environmental benefits can be achieved, especially for climate
   protection. A life cycle assessment (LCA) for biobutanol production with
   the genetically engineered cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803 is
   performed to test this hypothesis. A prospective and upscaled approach
   was applied to assess the environmental impacts at large-scale
   production (20 ha plant) for better comparability with conventional
   butanol production. The LCA results show that the engineering of
   microorganisms can improve the environmental impact, mainly due to the
   higher productivity compared to non-engineered cyanobacteria. However,
   the nevertheless high electricity demand required for the cultivation
   and harvesting process overcompensates this benefit. According to the
   scenario calculations, a more favourable climate gas balance can be
   achieved if renewable electricity is used. Then, greenhouse gas
   emissions are reduced to 3.1 kg CO2 eq/kg biobutanol, corresponding to
   20% more than the fossil reference: (2.45 kg CO2 eq./kg 1-butanol). The
   results indicate the importance of genetic engineering and the energy
   transition towards renewable electricity supply to take full advantage
   of the environmental potential of microorganisms as future green cell
   factories for sustainable biofuel production. Besides, the necessity of
   developing different scenarios for perspective and upscaled LCA for a
   fairer comparison with mature reference technologies is demonstrated.

SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 362

U1 6
U2 11
AB The production of biogas from microalgae has gained attention due to
   their rapid growth, CO2 sequestration, and minimal land use. This study
   uses life cycle assessment to assess the environmental impacts of biogas
   production from wastewater-grown microalgae through anaerobic digestion
   within an optimized microalgae-based system. Using SimaPro 9 software, 3
   scenarios were modeled considering the ReCiPe v1.13 midpoint and
   endpoint methods for environmental impact assessment in different
   categories. In the baseline scenario (S1), a hypothetical system for
   biogas production was considered, consisting of a high rate algal pond
   (HRAP), a settling, an anaerobic digester, and a biogas upgrading unit.
   The second scenario (S2) included strategies to enhance biogas yield,
   namely co-digestion and thermal pre-treatment. The third scenario (S3),
   besides considering the strategies of S2, proposed the biogas upgrading
   in the HRAP and the digestate recovery as a biofertilizer. After
   normalization, human carcinogenic toxicity was the most positively
   affected category due to water use in the cultivation step, accounted as
   avoided product. However, this category was also the most negatively
   affected by the impacts of the digester heating energy. Anaerobic
   digestion was the most impactful step, constituting on average 60.37% of
   total impacts. Scenario S3 performed better environmentally, primarily
   due to the integration of biogas upgrading within the cultivation
   reactor and digestate use as a biofertilizer. Sensitivity analysis
   highlighted methane yield's importance, showing potential for an 11.28%
   reduction in ionizing radiation impacts with a 10% increase. Comparing
   S3 biogas with natural gas, the resource scarcity impact was reduced
   sixfold, but the human health impact was 23 times higher in S3.

AB An integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) and quantitative microbial
   risk assessment (QMRA) were conducted to assess microalgae-mediated
   wastewater disinfection (M-WWD). M-WWD was achieved by replacing
   ultraviolet disinfection with a microalgal open raceway pond in an
   existing sewage treatment plant (STP) in India. Regarding impacts on
   human health, both M-WWD and STP yielded comparable life cycle impacts,
   around 0.01 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per person per year.
   However, QMRA impacts for M-WWD (0.053 DALYs per person per year) were
   slightly lower than that for STP while considering exposure toE. coli
   O157:H7and adenovirus. Additionally, a comparative LCA resolved the
   dilemma about the appropriate utilization of microalgal biomass. Among
   biodiesel, biocrude, and biogas production, the lowest impacts of 0.015
   DALYs per person per year were obtained for biocrude for 1 m3water
   treated by M-WWD. Electricity consumption in microalgae cultivation was
   a major environmental hotspot. Overall, M-WWD, followed by production of
   microalgal biocrude, emerged as a sustainable alternative from
   environmental and public health perspectives. These findings set the
   foundation for pilot-scale M-WWD system development, testing, and
   economic evaluation. Such comprehensive investigations, encompassing
   LCA, QMRA, and resource recovery scenarios, offer crucial insights for
   stakeholders and decision-makers in wastewater treatment and
   environmental management.

AB Microalgae biofuel production has been extensively evaluated through
   resource, economic and life cycle assessments. Resource assessments
   consistently identify land as non-limiting and highlight the need to
   consider siting based on combined geographical constraints of land and
   other critical resources such as water and carbon dioxide. Economic
   assessments report a selling cost of fuel that ranges between $1.64 and
   over $30 gal-1 consistent with large variability reported in the life
   cycle literature, -75 to 534 g CO2-eq MJ-1. Large drivers behind such
   variability stem from differences in productivity assumptions, pathway
   technologies, and system boundaries. Productivity represents
   foundational units in these assessments with current assumed yields in
   various assessments varying by a factor of 60. A review of the
   literature in these areas highlights the need for harmonized assessments
   such that direct comparisons of alternative processing technologies can
   be made on the metrics of resource requirements, economic feasibility,
   and environmental impact.

TI Environmental impact assessment of a novel third-generation biorefinery
   approach for astaxanthin and biofuel production.
SO Science of the Total Environment
VL 912
PY 2024
U1 4
U2 17
AB A novel third-generation biorefinery approach, including two paths of
   Ethanol/methane production pathway (EMP) and the direct methane
   production pathway (DMP), for astaxanthin and ethanol and biogas
   production from the freshwater microalgaeHaematococcus pluvialiswas
   developed previously. To ensure its environmental sustainability, a
   comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) study was conducted based on
   1-GJ energy generation from biomethane as the functional unit. Results
   indicate that the EMP pathway had higher environmental impacts on all
   categories due to more stages and chemicals/energy consumption (at least
   five times greater effect). Results showed that while the enzymatic
   hydrolysis step followed by the fermentation stage was the main
   contributor to all environmental categories in the EMP route,
   astaxanthin induction dominated all environmental categories in the DMP
   route. The results showed that sodium nitrate, phosphate salts, inoculum
   sludge, acetone, and electricity had considerable environmental impacts.
   Moreover, despite low enzyme usage in enzymatic hydrolysis, these
   proteins significantly impacted all environmental categories in this
   stage. The baseline analysis concluded that to produce 1 GJ energy from
   methane, about 88 kg and 13 kg CO2were generated from the EMP and DMP
   pathways, respectively. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to
   compare various ratios of chemicals, such as phosphate salts, with high
   contributions to enzymatic hydrolysis and astaxanthin induction stages
   in the EMP and DMP routes, respectively. Finally, the LCA results
   revealed that the DMP pathway is more environmentally friendly with the
   same economic value of biomethane and astaxanthin production. This LCA
   study updated the data related to the environmental assessment of
   processes to utilizeH. pluvialisto produce biofuels and astaxanthin
   simultaneously.

AB Literature review provides extensive studies focused on the life cycle
   assessment of wastewater treatment plants. However, few studies have a
   mitigation perspective, especially concerning water-energy-nutrient
   nexus or resource recovery systems for warm-weather countries. In this
   context, this paper aims to evaluate 10 wastewater treatment plants,
   based on an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket followed by a high rate
   aerobic pond. The recovery of biosolids, energy, and water, thermal and
   alkaline hydrolysis, CO2 recirculation to supplement carbon, and a
   membrane system for microalgae harvesting are tested. The paper uses the
   OpenLCA 1.9 software to evaluate the following categories: global
   warming potential and global temperature change potential (IPCC 2013);
   cumulative energy demand (Ecoinvent); acidification, human toxicity,
   marine and freshwater eutrophication, marine, freshwater and terrestrial
   ecotoxicity (ReCiPe (H) v.1.13 2008). Input data consist of a background
   (from Ecoinvent 3.5 and literature) and foreground mix. The work asses
   the following environmental aspects: energy, chemical materials use,
   transportation, and emissions. The results indicate that the scenario
   considering CO2 recirculation combined with thermal hydrolysis, with
   higher biosolids and energy production, has the lowest environmental
   impact for all categories. This result was due to materials manufacture
   and transportation, and comparative inputs added (natural gas energy,
   water, and fertilizer). Additionally, transportation variation only
   affects highly the iron chloride supply scenario. Emissions variation
   impacted directly on both IPCC categories for all scenarios, due to
   biogas losses accounted on the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket and
   anaerobic digester, while energy variation did not affect profoundly any
   of the scenarios.

SO Fermentation
VL 10

PY 2024
U1 2
U2 5
AB In the pursuit of sustainable solutions for contemporary environmental
   challenges arising from the increasing global demand for energy, this
   study delves into the potential of cyanobacteria, specifically
   Arthrospira platensis (commonly known as "spirulina"), as a versatile
   resource. Employing a life cycle assessment (LCA) in accordance with the
   ISO 14044:2006 standard and employing both midpoint and endpoint
   indicators, the study comprehensively evaluates environmental impacts.
   The research explored a range of scenarios, specifically investigating
   variations in light intensity and harvesting volume. These
   investigations were carried out using a pilot-scale photobioreactor,
   specifically an airlift reactor system featuring a horizontal tubular
   downcomer. The primary focus is on extracting valuable compounds, namely
   exopolysaccharides and phycocyanin. It emphasized the extraction of
   value-added products and strategic integration with a biogas plant for
   process heat, contributing to developing a sustainable supply network
   and offering insights into environmentally conscious algae cultivation
   practices with implications for renewable energy and the production of
   valuable products. The results emphasize the project's potential
   economic feasibility with minimal energy impact from by-product
   extraction. The environmental assessment identifies marine ecotoxicity
   and fossil resource depletion as principal impacts, predominantly
   influenced by upstreaming and harvesting stages. After conducting
   comparisons across various scenarios, it was found that cultivations
   under higher light intensities have a lower environmental impact than
   cultivations with low light supply. However, regardless of light
   intensity, processes with shorter harvesting cycles tend to have a
   smaller environmental impact compared to processes with longer
   harvesting cycles. Overall, this research contributes a nuanced and
   realistic perspective, fostering informed decision-making in sustainable
   algae cultivation practices, with implications for renewable energy and
   valuable compound production.

AB Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate the environmental impacts of
   phytoplanktonic biofuels as possible sustainable alternatives to fossil
   fuels. Three scenarios were examined for converting planktonic biomass
   into higher-value commodities and energy streams using the
   algaScenedesmussp. and the cyanobacteriumArthrospirasp. as the species
   of interest. The first scenario (Sc-1) involved the production of
   biodiesel and glycerol from the planktonic biomass. In the second
   scenario (Sc-2), biodiesel and glycerol were generated from the
   planktonic biomass, and biogas was produced from the residual biomass.
   The process also involved using a catalyst derived from snail shells for
   biodiesel production. The third scenario (Sc-3) was similar to Sc-2 but
   converted CO2from the biogas upgrading to methanol, which was then used
   in synthesizing biodiesel. The results indicated that Sc-2 and Sc-3 had
   a reduced potential (up to 60% less) for damaging human health compared
   to Sc-1. Sc-2 and Sc-3 had up to 61% less environmental impact than
   Sc-1. Sc-2 and Sc-3 reduced the total cumulative exergy demand by up to
   44% compared to Sc-1. In conclusion, producing chemicals and utilities
   within the biorefinery could significantly improve environmental
   sustainability, reduce waste, and diversify revenue streams.

TI Potential of microalgae cultivation using nutrient-rich wastewater and

U2 69
AB Microalgae have been identified as one of the new feedstocks for
   renewable energy production. The conversion of microalgae into various
   valuable products has also been increasing in the last decade.
   Microalgae harvesting, one of the most important stages in microalgae
   production, has been studied and reviewed by many researchers. However,
   most harvesting methods still utilize chemicals during the process,
   which make harvested biomass not directly ready for food/feed production
   and pharmaceutical-related processes. Biocoagulants/bioflocculants are
   emerging compounds that can be used during the harvesting of microalgae
   because their existence does not introduce toxicity in the harvested
   biomass. Considering its potential to produce ready-to-use biomass,
   biocoagulants/bioflocculants have a bright future in microalgal biomass
   production processes. This review article highlights simultaneous
   wastewater treatment and microalgal biomass production as an emerging
   method in accommodating a circular economy paradigm. This paper
   juxtaposes the utilization of chemical-based coagulants/flocculants and
   biocoagulants/bioflocculants in harvesting microalgae. Biodegradability,
   effectiveness, harvested biomass characteristics, and potential of
   medium reuse are emphasized in the discussion. The agglomeration
   mechanisms of microalgae during harvesting, recent advances in the
   microalgal biomass conversions, and future challenges related to the
   utilization of biocoagulants/bioflocculants are also described in
   detail. Microalgae harvesting by using biocoagulants/bioflocculants is a
   feasible and promising environmentally friendly technology for
   microalgal biomass production.

AB Pork production has expanded in the world in recent years. This growth
   has caused a significant increase in waste from this industry,
   especially of wastewater. Although there has been an increase in
   wastewater treatment, there is a lack of useful technologies for the
   treatment of wastewater from the pork industry. Swine farms generate
   high amounts of organic pollution, with large amounts of nitrogen and
   phosphorus with final destination into water bodies. Sadly, little
   attention has been devoted to animal wastes, which are currently treated
   in simple systems, such as stabilization ponds or just discharged to the
   environment without previous treatment. This uncontrolled release of
   swine wastewater is a major cause of eutrophication processes. Among the
   possible treatments, phyco-remediation seems to be a sustainable and
   environmentally friendly option of removing compounds from wastewater
   such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and some metal ions. Several studies have
   demonstrated the feasibility of treating swine wastewater using
   different microalgae species. Nevertheless, the practicability of
   applying this procedure at pilot-scale has not been explored before as
   an integrated process. This work presents an overview of the
   technological applications of microalgae for the treatment of wastewater
   from swine farms and the by-products (pigments, polysaccharides, lipids,
   proteins) and services of commercial interest (biodiesel, biohydrogen,
   bioelectricity, biogas) generated during this process. Furthermore, the
   environmental benefits while applying microalgae technologies are
   discussed.

AB The inherent capability and increased efficiency of microalgae to
   convert sunlight into solar chemical energy are further enhanced by the
   higher amount of oils stored in microalgae compared to other land-based
   plant species. Therefore, the widespread interest in producing biofuels
   from microalgae has gained considerable interest among leading energy
   experts and researchers due to the burgeoning global issues stemming
   from the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, future energy security,
   increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and the competition for limited
   resources between food crops and conventional biomass feedstock. This
   paper aims to present the recent advances in biofuel production from
   microalgae and the potential benefits of microalgae in the energy and
   environmental sectors, as well as sustainable development. Besides,
   bottlenecks and challenges mainly relating to techniques of cultivation
   and harvesting, as well as downstream processes are completely
   presented. Promising solutions and novel trends for realizing strategies
   of producing biofuels from microalgae on an industrial and commercial
   scale are also discussed in detail. Alternatively, the role of
   microalgae in the circular economy is thoroughly analyzed, indicating
   that the potential of scaling up current microalgae-based production
   could benefit from the waste-to-energy strategy with microalgae as a key
   intermediate. In the future, further research into combining different
   microalgae biomass pretreatment techniques, separating the microalgae
   feedstock from the cultured media, developing new species, and
   optimizing the biofuel production process should be carried out to
   reduce the prices of microalgae biofuels.

AB Phycoremediation is an eco-friendly and low operational-cost technique.
   It promotes green technology for biofuel production, high nutrient
   recovery, and wastewater treatment through microalgae. This review
   encompasses a set of algal-based remediation methods for potentially
   toxic elements (PTEs) from agricultural discharges and industrial
   wastewater. Large-scale algae production approaches, such as suspended
   cultures in open ponds or closed reactors and immobilized cultures,
   include biofilm and matrix-immobilized systems for biomass and the
   removal of wastewater nutrients, as well as PTEs. Fundamentals for
   remediation of PTEs using microalgae are biosorption and
   bioaccumulation, and thus, this review summarizes how microalgae are
   beneficial for wastewater treatment. Further, this review describes
   recent technologies,i.e., bioreactors, high-rate algal ponds, commercial
   sorption, etc., used in wastewater treatment and their specifications
   and eco-friendly remediation of contaminants from agricultural and
   industrial effluent. Wastewater treatment process utilizes algae or
   macro-algae in both conventional facultative ponds and advanced algal
   ponds, such as high-rate algal ponds with photo-bioreactors. This review
   also covers the advancement in the bioremediation of nutrients and PTE
   contaminants in agricultural and industrial wastewater using microalgae.
   Lastly, this review concluded with various limitations, challenges, and
   prospects on algae implications in wastewater, considering carbon
   neutrality and circular economy.

AB This study compared the solar energy utilization of a closed

   fertilizer recovery against that of a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV)
   system. The comparison was made from the perspective of broad life cycle
   assessment, simultaneously taking exergy to be the functional unit. The
   results indicated that the bio-loop was more environmentally competitive
   than an equivalent stand-alone PV system, but had higher economic cost
   due to high energy consumption during the operational phase. To fix the
   problem, a patented, interior pressurization scheduling method was used
   to operate the bio-loop, with microalgae and aerobic bacterial placed
   together in the same reactor. As a result, the overall environmental
   impact and total investment were respectively reduced by more than 75%
   and 84%, a vast improvement on the bio-loop.

AB Sustainable management of natural resources is critical to food
   security. The shrimp feed and fishery sector is expanding rapidly,
   necessitating the development of alternative sustainable components.
   Several factors necessitate the exploration of a new source of
   environmentally friendly and nutrient-rich fish feed ingredients.
   Microalgal biomass has the potential to support the growth of fish and
   shrimp aquaculture for global food security in the bio-economy. Algal
   biorefineries must valorize the whole crop to develop a viable
   microalgae-based economy. Microalgae have the potential to replace fish
   meal and fish oil in aquaculture and ensure sustainability standards.
   Microalgae biomasses provide essential amino acids, valuable
   triglycerides such as lipids, vitamins, and pigments, making them
   suitable as nutritional supplements in livestock feed formulations. Fish
   and microalgae have similar nutritional profiles, and digestibility is a
   critical aspect of the aquafeed formulation. A highly digestible feed
   reduces production costs, feed waste, and the risk of eutrophication.
   Due to low input costs, low carbon footprint, wastewater treatment
   benefits, and carbon credits from industrial CO2conversion,
   microalgae-based fish and shrimp feeds have the potential to provide
   significant economic benefits. However, several challenges must be
   addressed before microalgal biomass and bioproducts may be used as fish
   feeds, including heavy metal bioaccumulation, poor algal biomass
   digestion, and antinutrient effects. Knowledge of biochemical
   composition is limited and diverse, and information on nutritional value
   is scattered or contradictory. This review article presents alternative
   approaches that could be used in aquaculture to make microalgal biomass
   a viable alternative to fish meal.

AB The most important global demand is the energy supply from alternative
   source. Ethanol may be considered an environmental friendly fuel that
   has been produced by feedstock. The production of ethanol by microalgae
   represent a process with reduced environmental impact with efficient
   CO2fixation and requiring less arable land. This work studied the
   production of ethanol from green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtiithrough
   the cellular metabolism in a light/dark cycle at 25°C in a TAP medium
   with sulfur depletion. The parameters evaluated were inoculum
   concentration and the medium supplementation with mixotrophic carbon
   sources. The combination ofC. reinhardtiiandRhodobacter
   capsulatusthrough a hybrid or co-culture systems was also investigated
   as well.C. reinhardtiimaintained in TAP-S produced 19.254.16 g/L
   (ethanol). In addition, in a hybrid system, with medium initially
   supplemented with milk whey permeated and the algal effluent used byR.
   capsulatus, the ethanol production achieved 19.942.67 g/L.

AB This study aimed to investigate the impact of the ratio of Spirulina
   maxima biomass to inoculum on the anaerobic co-digestion of malting
   wastewater using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket pilot-scale reactors.
   The AD process occurred in mesophilic conditions, lasting for 369 h. The
   experimental conditions included three groups: (1) malting wastewater
   (control); (2) malting wastewater with an 80:20 inoculum/Spirulina
   maxima ratio; (3) malting wastewater with a 60:40 inoculum/Spirulina
   maxima ratio. The 60:40 inoculum/Spirulina maxima ratio demonstrated
   superior performance, generating 6.7 times more biomethane compared to
   both the control and the 80:20 inoculum/Spirulina maxima ratio. This
   condition achieved a chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 76%.
   Furthermore, the digestate generated did not exhibit phytotoxicity
   towards lettuce and barley. Therefore, co-digestion digestates can be
   effectively utilized in agriculture. Co-digestion was also found to be
   efficient in simultaneously treating co-digestion, generating
   biomethane, and producing biofertilizer. This work emphasizes a
   promising and sustainable approach to valorizing waste and effluents,
   which has positive impacts on bioenergy generation and food production.
   It promotes the principles of the circular economy and sustainability in
   agriculture.

TI Life cycle assessment of microalgae-derived biodiesel.
SO International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment
VL 28
IS 5
PS 590-609
PY 2023
U1 9
U2 44
AB Purpose: Microalgae-derived biofuels are considered a low-carbon
   alternative to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, as with all biofuels, there
   is still uncertainty around their sustainability. Most life cycle
   assessments (LCA) of microalgae biofuels so far used lab-based,
   scaled-up lab experimental data or data from the scientific literature.
   This article, provides evidence and analysis, undertaking an LCA using
   real-world data from an industrial facility that uses a combination of
   photobioreactor and fermenter systems. Methods: The current
   well-to-wheel LCA study aimed to compare the environmental impacts of
   microalgae biodiesel production-under different energy regimes-and with
   petroleum-derived diesel. The functional unit was considered as
   "combustion of 1 MJ (Lower Heating Value) of algal biodiesel in an
   internal combustion engine (as B100)". This LCA study considers the
   environmental and energy impacts from the construction of the facility,
   as well as those impacts from the operation of the facility. The
   foreground LCI data was collected from a real-world one-hectare
   microalgae production pilot facility. ReCiPe, IPCC AR5 (GWP100 and
   GWP20) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP) were implemented to assess
   the life cycle environmental impacts. Results and discussion: The
   assessment shows that when infrastructure is included,
   microalgae-derived biofuels are not yet favourable over
   petroleum-derived fuels on GWP100, and this becomes worse over shorter
   timescales. In terms of climate change (GWP100), whilst 1 MJ (LHV) of
   fossil-derived diesel would emit 8.84 * 10-2 kg CO2eq, 1 MJ of
   microalgae-derived biodiesel from a solar photovoltaic powered facility
   would emit 1.48 * 10-1 kg CO2eq. To be equal to petroleum-derived diesel
   in terms of GWP100, or perform better, productivity of the microalgae
   production system needs to be improved as the most effective solution.
   The results also showed that electricity and infrastructure were major
   sources of environmental impacts, as well as the yeast used within the
   fermenter. Moreover, it takes 0.99 MJ of direct energy per 1 MJ of
   microalgae biofuel produced, similar to the fossil fuel industry for 1
   MJ of diesel. Conclusions: Using infrastructure and operational models,
   the study shows that the facility does not compare well with
   petroleum-derived diesel unless productivity can be increased.
   Productivity improvements, be it through improvements to microalgae
   strains or improved photobioreactor designs, should be a priority to
   ensure microalgae become a sustainable fuel feedstock. Electricity use
   should be reduced as well, again, through improved cultivation system
   designs. In terms of the current system, the high impacts of yeast
   should be addressed, either through co-locating yeast production or
   through ensuring specific sources with lower impacts. Extracting lipids
   will effectively waste some high-value products, whilst the waste can be
   expected to be a mixture of unextracted lipids, polysaccharides or
   fibre, some proteins and minerals. It is also shown that harmonisations
   of the assessments are needed for future studies and real-world
   operation facilities to conclusively decide if microalgae should be used
   as fuel or if they would be better used for other products, such as feed
   or high-value products.

TI How to optimise photosynthetic biogas upgrading: a perspective on system
   design and microalgae selection.
SO Biotechnology Advances
VL 37

PY 2019
U1 6
U2 118
AB Photosynthetic biogas upgrading using microalgae provides a promising
   alternative to commercial upgrading processes as it allows for carbon
   capture and re-use, improving the sustainability of the process in a
   circular economy system. A two-step absorption column-photobioreactor
   system employing alkaline carbonate solution and flat plate
   photobioreactors is proposed. Together with process optimisation, the
   choice of microalgae species is vital to ensure continuous performance
   with optimal efficiency. In this paper, in addition to critically
   assessing the system design and operation conditions for optimisation,
   five criteria are selected for choosing optimal microalgae species for
   biogas upgrading. These include: ability for mixotrophic growth; high pH
   tolerance; external carbonic anhydrase activity; high CO2 tolerance; and
   ease of harvesting. Based on such criteria, five common microalgae
   species were identified as potential candidates. Of these, Spirulina
   platensis is deemed the most favourable species. An industrial
   perspective of the technology further reveals the significant challenges
   for successful commercial application of microalgal upgrading of biogas,
   including: a significant land footprint; need for decreasing microalgae
   solution recirculation rate; and selecting preferable microalgae
   utilisation pathway.

AB This paper aims to demonstrate an innovative process for the conversion
   of food waste digestate (FWD) powder into biofuel. The effects of
   different doses of FWD are investigated on microalgae-activated sludge
   (MAS) in treating pulp and paper mill wastewater (PPW) which generally
   contains insufficient nitrogen and phosphorus. FWD was added to adjust
   the initial N:P molar ratio in MAS at various levels (8:1 to 15:1). The
   highest Auxenochlorella protothecoides biomass achieved was 1.67 gL-1 at
   a 13.45:1 N/P molar ratio of PPW. After 10 days of cultivation,
   Auxenochlorella protothecoides-activated sludge system removed 91.7%,
   74.6%, and 91.5% of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and sCOD respectively at
   D0.836 gL-1 DD. The highest lipid productivity was reported as 41.27 
   2.43 mg L-1 day-1. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis showed the
   presence of an appreciable percentage of balanced saturated and
   unsaturated fatty acids i.e. palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acid,
   rendering its potential as a feedstock for biodiesel production.
   Activated sludge induced flocculation of Auxenochlorella protothecoides
   was measured. The whole process establishes an effective means of
   circular economy, where the secondary source of recyclable nutrients
   i.e. FWD will be used as a source of N and P in PPW to obtain algal
   biodiesel from a negative value industrial wastewater.

AB Microalgae are a broad group of microscopically small photosynthetic
   organisms that can also be cultivated in wastewater, biogas digestate
   and other wastewater from the agricultural and food industry. Microalgae
   recycle up to 95% nitrogen and phosphorus, which can be processed into
   fertilizers, biostimulants, biodiesel or biogas, thus following the laws
   of the circular economy: waste nutrients are reused in food or energy
   production. Microalgae processed into biostimulants are a source of
   plant macro and micronutrients, amino acids and phytohormones, so that
   plants can grow better and become more resistant. In the greenhouse of
   the Department of Agronomy of Biotechnical Faculty in Ljubljana, in
   cooperation with the company Algen d.o.o., we cultivate microalgae for
   the production of biostimulants as part of the European project
   Water2REturn, which aims to present innovative technologies for
   wastewater treatment. The produced biomass was processed by
   high-pressure homogenization, followed by an experiment on white mustard
   (Sinapsis albaL.) and cucumber (Cucumis sativusL.), in which the auxin-
   and cytokinin-like biostimulatory effects of the obtained extract and
   untreated microalgae were measured. The high-pressure homogenization did
   not increase the biostimulatory effect compared to untreated microalgae,
   from which it can be concluded that microalgae release also
   extracellular biostimulants (e.g. phytohormones).

AB Biofuels produced by photosynthetic microorganisms are considered a
   renewable, sustainable, and eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels
   that cause a negative environmental impact. Microalgae can accumulate
   the end-products and precursors required for biodiesel production with
   higher productivity and better sustainability than conventional energy
   crops. High lipid content, a metabolic rate faster than that of higher
   plants, and an ability to grow under poor conditions are the desirable
   characteristics of microalgae that make them an efficient feedstock for
   the economical production of biodiesel. In this study, we attempted to
   improve the lipid content of microalgae by metabolically redirecting the
   carbon flux from carbohydrate or cyanophycin synthesis to lipid
   synthesis.Synechocystissp. PCC6803, a model microalga for genetic
   modification studies, was used to study the effect of deletion of
   specific metabolic genes and the introduction of an exogenous gene.
   InSynechocystis, glycogen and cyanophycin primarily store carbon, and
   are accumulated in the absence of nitrogen sources. The genes encoding
   the enzymes ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (glgC: slr1176) and
   cyanophycin synthase (cphA: slr2002), which are involved in glycogen and
   cyanophycin synthesis, respectively, were knocked out to block
   cyanophycin or glycogen synthesis and increase the carbon pool for lipid
   synthesis. Blocking glycogen synthesis decreased the carbohydrate
   content by up to 71% and increased the fatty acid content by up to 24%
   compared with the wild-type strain cultivated under nitrate-deficient
   conditions. Blocking cyanophycin synthesis did not affect the fatty acid
   content. Our results could be used to construct genetically
   engineeredSynechocystisfor the large-scale production of fatty acids.

AB Biofuels are emerged as an alternative to fossil fuels due to their
   sustainable and renewable nature. Among various biofuel sources, algae
   have gained significant attention due to their high growth rates,
   photosynthetic efficiency, and ability to produce lipids and
   carbohydrates required for Biofuels production. Algae cultivation has no
   special requirements only water, simple salts, minerals, and sunlight
   are required. Also, biofuel production from algae cultivated in
   wastewater has an added advantage of wastewater treatment and
   CO2sequestration from the environment. Although, commercial feasibility
   of algae based biofuel is still uncertain and so far not clear if it
   could compete equally with other available fuels in the market. The
   experts are in favour of promotion of algae based biofuels considering
   the added advantage of carbon sequestration and wastewater treatment
   approach involved in algae based biofuels. The concept of a circular
   economy and carbon neutrality in algae cultivation and harvesting are
   two intertwined approaches that hold great promise for sustainable and
   environmental friendly algae based biofuel production. This article
   provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in algae-based
   biofuel production, focusing on cultivation and harvesting techniques,
   factors affecting algae growth, algae-based biofuel production
   technologies, and the commercial feasibility of algae for biofuel
   production. Further, research related to cultivation and harvesting,
   developing new species, and optimizing the biofuel production process
   should be carried out to make the prices of algae based biofuels
   competitive.

AB This paper provides an analysis of the potential environmental impacts
   of biodiesel production from microalgae. High production yields of
   microalgae have called forth interest of economic and scientific actors
   but it is still unclear whether the production of biodiesel is
   environmentally interesting and which transformation steps need further
   adjustment and optimization. A comparative LCA study of a virtual
   facility has been undertaken to assess the energetic balance and the
   potential environmental impacts of the whole process chain, from the
   biomass production to the biodiesel combustion. Two different culture
   conditions, nominal fertilizing or nitrogen starvation, as well as two
   different extraction options, dry or wet extraction, have been tested.
   The best scenario has been compared to first generation biodiesel and
   oil diesel. The outcome confirms the potential of microalgae as an
   energy source but highlights the imperative necessity of decreasing the
   energy and fertilizer consumption. Therefore control of nitrogen stress
   during the culture and optimization of wet extraction seem to be
   valuable options. This study also emphasizes the potential of anaerobic
   digestion of oilcakes as a way to reduce external energy demand and to
   recycle a part of the mineral fertilizers.

AB In this study, the potential ofChlorella sorokinianaJD1-1 for biodiesel
   production was evaluated using domestic wastewater (DWW) as a diluent
   for locally-generated livestock wastewater (LWW). This strategy aimed to
   provide sustainable wastewater treatment, reduce environmental impacts,
   enhance cost-effectiveness, and promote biodiesel production. LWW was
   diluted with tap water and DWW at ratios of 75%, 50%, and 25% (v/v), and
   the effects on microalgal growth, nutrient removal efficiency, and lipid
   yield were evaluated. Although the maximum biomass concentration was
   observed in the artificial growth medium (BG-11) (1170 mg L-1), 75%
   dilution using tap water (610 mg L-1) and DWW (780 mg L-1) yielded
   results comparable to the exclusive use of DWW (820 mg L-1), suggesting
   a potential for substitution. Total nitrogen (TN) removal rates were
   consistently high under all conditions, particularly in samples with
   higher concentrations of LWW. Conversely, total phosphorus (TP)
   concentrations decreased under most conditions, although some displayed
   large increases. Further studies are necessary to optimize the nutrient
   balance while maintaining economic feasibility and maximizing biodiesel
   production.

AB Cyanobacterial wastewater-based biorefineries are a sustainable
   alternative to obtain high-value products with reduced costs. This study
   aimed to obtain phycobiliproteins and carotenoids, along with biogas
   from a wastewater-borne cyanobacterium grown in secondary effluent from
   an urban wastewater treatment plant, namely treated wastewater. For the
   first time, the presence of contaminants of emerging concern in
   concentrated pigment extracts was assessed. Tertiary wastewater
   treatment was conducted in a 3 L photobioreactor inoculated
   withSynechococcussp., and operated in semi-continuous regime with a
   hydraulic retention time of 6 days. The carotenoid content was stable
   (reaching up to 4 mg g DW-1) regardless of the wastewater composition,
   while the phycobiliprotein content (up to 214 mg g DW-1) varied
   according to nitrogen availability. In concentrated pigment extracts,
   only 3 (out of 20) organic microcontaminants were detected. The
   biochemical methane potential of pigment-extracted biomass (222 NL CH4kg
   VS-1) was still 72% of raw biomass. In conclusion, a cyanobacteria
   culture rich inSynechococcussp. appears as a promising source of
   bio-based products in a circular economy approach.

   microbes: prospects for integrated biofuel production.
SO Frontiers in Microbiology
VL 12

U1 10
U2 74
AB Biodiesel is an eco-friendly, renewable, and potential liquid biofuel
   mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiesel has been produced
   initially from vegetable oils, non-edible oils, and waste oils. However,
   these feedstocks have several disadvantages such as requirement of land
   and labor and remain expensive. Similarly, in reference to waste oils,
   the feedstock content is succinct in supply and unable to meet the
   demand. Recent studies demonstrated utilization of lignocellulosic
   substrates for biodiesel production using oleaginous microorganisms.
   These microbes accumulate higher lipid content under stress conditions,
   whose lipid composition is similar to vegetable oils. In this paper,
   feedstocks used for biodiesel production such as vegetable oils,
   non-edible oils, oleaginous microalgae, fungi, yeast, and bacteria have
   been illustrated. Thereafter, steps enumerated in biodiesel production
   from lignocellulosic substrates through pretreatment, saccharification
   and oleaginous microbe-mediated fermentation, lipid extraction,
   transesterification, and purification of biodiesel are discussed.
   Besides, the importance of metabolic engineering in ensuring biofuels
   and biorefinery and a brief note on integration of liquid biofuels have
   been included that have significant importance in terms of circular
   economy aspects.

AB Torrefaction is a vital pretreatment technology for thermochemical
   biorefinery applications like pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction.
   Oxidative torrefaction, an economical version of torrefaction, has
   recently gained much attention in the renewable energy field. Recent
   literature on inert and oxidative torrefaction was critically reviewed
   in this work to provide necessary guidance for future research and
   commercial implementations. The critical performance parameters of
   torrefaction for thermochemical biorefinery applications, such as solid
   yield, energy yield, carbon enhancement, higher heating value (HHV)
   enhancement, and energy-mass co-benefit index (EMCI), were also
   analyzed. Agricultural waste, woody biomass, and microalgae were
   considered. The analysis reveals that woody biomass could equally
   benefit from oxidative or inert torrefaction. In contrast, inert
   torrefaction was found more suitable for agricultural wastes and
   microalgae. Using flue gas as the oxidative torrefaction medium and
   waste biomass as the feedstock could achieve a circular economy,
   improving the sustainability of oxidative torrefaction for
   thermochemical biorefineries. The significant challenges in oxidative
   torrefaction include high ash content in torrefied agricultural waste,
   the oxidative thermal runaway of fibrous biomass during torrefaction,
   temperature control, and scale-up in reactors. Some proposed solutions
   to address these challenges are combined washing and torrefaction
   pretreatment, balancing oxygen content, temperature, and residence time,
   depending on the biomass type, and recirculating torrefaction gases.

PS (20 June 2013)
PY 2013
U1 0
U2 1
AB Background: Microalgae are touted as an attractive alternative to
   traditional forms of biomass for biofuel production, due to high
   productivity, ability to be cultivated on marginal lands, and potential
   to utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial flue gas. This work
   examines the fossil energy return on investment (EROIfossil), greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions, and direct Water Demands (WD) of producing dried
   algal biomass through the cultivation of microalgae in Open Raceway
   Ponds (ORP) for 21 geographic locations in the contiguous United States
   (U.S.). For each location, comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) is
   performed for multiple microalgal biomass production pathways,
   consisting of a combination of cultivation and harvesting options.
   Results: Results indicate that the EROIfossilfor microalgae biomass vary
   from 0.38 to 1.08 with life cycle GHG emissions of -46.2 to 48.9 (g
   CO2eq/MJ-biomass) and direct WDs of 20.8 to 38.8 (Liters/MJ-biomass)
   over the range of scenarios analyzed. Further anaylsis reveals that the
   EROIfossilfor production pathways is relatively location invariant, and
   that algae's life cycle energy balance and GHG impacts are highly
   dependent on cultivation and harvesting parameters. Contrarily, algae's
   direct water demands were found to be highly sensitive to geographic
   location, and thus may be a constraining factor in sustainable
   algal-derived biofuel production. Additionally, scenarios with promising
   EROIfossiland GHG emissions profiles are plagued with high technological
   uncertainty. Conclusions: Given the high variability in microalgae's
   energy and environmental performance, careful evaluation of the
   algae-to-fuel supply chain is necessary to ensure the long-term
   sustainability of emerging algal biofuel systems. Alternative production
   scenarios and technologies may have the potential to reduce the critical
   demands of biomass production, and should be considered to make algae a
   viable and more efficient biofuel alternative.

   (sigma=60), 3 times more methane than was produced by the LEA, 140

   efforts in microalgae to biofuel assessments are not reflecting the

SO Fuel Processing Technology
VL 250
PY 2023
U1 4
U2 15
AB Volatile-char interaction has been well documented in co-pyrolysis of
   varied feedstocks, which might also exist in activation process and
   impact pore evolution of activated carbon (AC). This was investigated
   herein in activation of mixed sawdust and spirulina with K2C2O4 at 800°C
   in two scenarios: one-step direct activation or two-step activation with
   an intermediate pre-carbonization. The results showed that volatile-char
   interaction via cross-polymerisation of the volatiles was more
   significant in the pre-carbonization step, forming more biochar/bio-oil
   while less gases. However, volatile-char interaction was not that
   important in impacting product yields and evolution of pore structures
   of AC in activation. This was due to the dominance of
   gasification/cracking with presence of K2C2O4, minimizing the chances
   for volatile-char interaction. The in-situ DRIFTS characterization of
   the activation process showed that removal of oxygen-containing species
   like C=O with K2C2O4 was important for generating pore structures.
   Comparing with two-step activation, one-step activation of sawdust,
   spirulina and their mixture without pre-carbonization all generated the
   ACs of more developed pore structures and showed higher environmental
   impact. The pre-carbonization removed a significant portion of thermally
   unstable aliphatic structures, enhancing aromatic degree and creating
   difficulty for generating pores via gasification/cracking in subsequent
   activation.

AB This paper analyses the potential environmental impacts and economic
   viability of producing biodiesel from microalgae grown in ponds. A
   comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study of a notional production
   system designed for Australian conditions was conducted to compare
   biodiesel production from algae (with three different scenarios for
   carbon dioxide supplementation and two different production rates) with
   canola and ULS (ultra-low sulfur) diesel. Comparisons of GHG (greenhouse
   gas) emissions (g CO2-e/t km) and costs (e/t km) are given. Algae GHG
   emissions (-27.6 to 18.2) compare very favourably with canola (35.9) and
   ULS diesel (81.2). Costs are not so favourable, with algae ranging from
   2.2 to 4.8, compared with canola (4.2) and ULS diesel (3.8). This
   highlights the need for a high production rate to make algal biodiesel
   economically attractive.

AB Wine production represents one of the most important agro-industrial
   sectors in Italy. Wine lees are the most significant waste in the winery
   industry and have high disposal and storage costs and few applications
   within the circular economy. In this study, anaerobic digestion and a
   microalgae coupled process was studied in order to treat wine lees and
   waste activated sludge produced within the same facility, with the aim
   of producing energy and valuable microalgae biomass that could be
   processed to recover biofuel or biostimulant. Chlorella vulgaris was
   cultivated on liquid digestate in a semi-continuous system without
   biomass recirculation. The best growth and phytoremediation performance
   were achieved applying a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days with
   a stable dry weight, lipid and protein storage of 1.85  0.02 g l-1,
   33.48  7.54% and 57.85  10.14% respectively. Lipid characterization
   highlighted the potential use in high quality biodiesel production,
   according to EN14214 (<12% v/v linolenic acid). The microalgae reactor's
   liquid output showed high removal of ammonia (95.72  2.10%), but low
   organic soluble matter reduction. Further semi-continuous process
   optimization was carried out by increasing the time between digestate
   feeding and biomass recovery at HRT 10. These operative changes avoided
   biomass wash-out and provided a stable phytoremediation of the digestate
   with 84.58  4.02% ammonia removal, 33.01  1.44% sCOD removal, 38.06 
   2.65% of polyphenols removal.

AB In the concept of a circular economy, wastewater is no longer waste but
   a resource for water, energy and nutrients. In this study, a hybrid
   system containing an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and a
   microalgal membrane reactor (MMR) was developed to harvest energy,
   nutrients, and microalgal biomass from food and agribusiness industrial
   wastewater. The AnMBR removed over 97% of chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   and generated 4.7  0.15 L (n=80) of biogas equivalent to 2.4 kWh kg-1
   COD (feed) d-1. Through anaerobic metabolism, the microorganism in AnMBR
   generated NH4+ and PO43--rich effluent. Their effluent concentrations
   were 1.9 and 1.4 times of that in the influent, respectively. NH4+ and
   PO43--rich effluent was directly used (i.e. without filtration or
   sterilization) to culture microalgae Chlorella vulgaris in the MMR.
   Microalgal biomass production reached up to 700 mg/L after 6 days of
   operation and nutrient removal rates of above 75% were achieved.
   However, biomass production and nutrient removal declined towards the
   end of experiment. The generated biomass was completely harvested using
   cationic polyacrylamide at the dose of 36 mg g-1 dry weight. Overall,
   the AnMBR has great potential to produce energy. Future research is
   needed to intensify the microalgal growth (e.g. genetic modification of
   strains, addition of plant hormones) in the MMR for continuous operation
   of the hybrid system.

   interest, after being exposed for fourteen days to urban wastewater (UW)
   from Malaga city (UW concentrations: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%); (2) the
   study of the capacity ofC. fuscato bioremediate UW in photobioreactors
   at laboratory scale; and (3) the evaluation of the effect of UW on the
   physiological status ofC. fusca, as photosynthetic capacity by using in
   vivo Chlafluorescence related to photosystem II and the production of
   photosynthetic pigments.C. fuscacell density increased in treatments
   with 50% UW concentration, followed by the treatment with 100% UW, 75%
   UW, the control, and finally 25% UW. Protein content increased to 50.5%
   in 75% UW concentration. Stress induced to microalgal cultures favored
   the increase of lipid production, reaching a maximum of 16.7% in 100% UW
   concentration. The biological oxygen demand (BOD5) analysis indicated a
   75% decrease in 100% UW concentration. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   levels decreased by 41% and 40% in 50% UW and 100% UW concentration, and
   total nitrogen (TN) decreased by 55% in 50% UW concentration. The
   physiological status showed the stressful effect caused by the presence
   of UW on photosynthetic activity, with increasing impact as UW
   concentration grew. In the framework of circular economy, we seek to
   deepen this study to use the biomass ofC. fuscato obtain metabolites of
   interest for biofuel production and other biotechnological areas.

AB The costs and life cycle impacts of microalgae harvesting for biofuel
   production were investigated. Algae were grown in semi-continuous
   culture in pilot-scale photobioreactors under natural light with
   anaerobic digester centrate as the feed source. Algae suspensions were
   collected and the optimal coagulant dosages for metal salts (alum,
   ferric chloride), cationic polymer (Zetag 8819), anionic polymer (E-38)
   and natural coagulants (Moringa Oleifera and Opuntia ficus-indica
   cactus) were determined using jar tests. The relative dewaterability of
   the algae cake was estimated by centrifugation. Alum, ferric chloride
   and cationic polymer could all achieve >91% algae recovery at optimal
   dosages. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost analysis results revealed
   that cationic polymer had the lowest cost but the highest environmental
   impacts, while ferric chloride had the highest cost and lowest
   environmental impacts. Based on the LCA results, belt presses are the
   recommended algae dewatering technology prior to oil extraction.

AB In the current global context marked by a growing population and rapid
   urbanization, there are pressing challenges related to shrinking arable
   land and the effective management of an ever-increasing volume of
   wastewater. The food industry, while holding the potential to address
   these challenges through improved techniques and exploring alternative
   dietary resources, is itself a significant contributor to these issues.
   Industry's operations demand substantial water and energy resources
   while generating a substantial volume of wastewater characterized by
   organic pollutants and nutrient richness. Microalgae-based wastewater
   treatment exhibits the capacity to reduce inorganic nutrient loads,
   sequester carbon dioxide, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions while
   inhibiting the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, an
   integrated approach that combines both microalgae and bacteria emerges
   as a comprehensive solution, addressing the challenges of reducing
   organic and inorganic waste simultaneously while leveraging their
   symbiotic contributions to biogeochemical cycling processes. By
   concurrently applying algae and bacteria, the wastewater management
   system can be significantly enhanced, thereby reducing the associated
   carbon footprint related to mechanical aeration for CO2 and O2, which
   would be necessary if these organisms were cultivated independently.
   Additionally, this integrated system generates a substantial amount of
   residual microalgal biomass, which can play a pivotal role in
   biorefinery concepts, enhancing economic viability. The remaining
   biomass can also be utilized for fermentation to produce methane or
   ethanol, promoting sustainable development and a transition to a
   circular economy. This review paper outlines various methodologies for
   the simultaneous utilization of microalgae and bacteria in wastewater
   management.

AB Microalgae can serve as a highly productive biological feedstock for
   fuels and chemicals. The lipid fraction has been the primary target of
   research, but numerous assessments have found that valorization of
   co-products is essential to achieve economic and environmental goals.
   The relative proportion of co-products depends on the biomolecular
   composition of algae at the time of harvesting. In the present study,
   the productivity of lipid, starch, and protein fractions were shown
   through growth experiments to vary widely with species, feeding regime,
   and harvesting period. Four algae species were cultivated under
   nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions and analyzed at 3-day
   intervals. Dynamic growth results were then used for life cycle
   assessment using the US Department of Energy's GREET model to determine
   optimal growth scenarios that minimize life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, eutrophication, and cumulative energy demand (CED), while
   aiming for an energy return on investment (EROI) greater than unity. Per
   kg of biodiesel produced,C. sorokinianain N-replete conditions harvested
   at 12 days was most favorable for GHG emissions and CED, despite having
   a lipid content of <20%.N. oculatain N-deplete conditions with a 12-day
   harvesting period had the lowest life cycle eutrophication impacts,
   driven by efficient nutrient cycling and valorization of microalgal
   protein and anaerobic digester residue co-products. Results indicate
   that growth cycle times that maximize a single fraction do not
   necessarily result in the most favorable environmental performance on a
   life cycle basis, underscoring the importance of designing biorefinery
   systems that - simultaneously optimize for lipid and non-lipid
   fractions.

AB Microalgal biodiesel production has been investigated for decades, yet
   it is not commercially available. Part of the problem is that the
   production process is energy and chemical intensive due, in part, to the
   high portion of microalgal biomass left as residues. This study
   investigated cradle-to-gate life-cycle environmental impacts from six
   different scenarios of microalgal biodiesel and its co-products. Ozone
   depletion, global warming, photochemical smog formation, acidification
   and eutrophication potentials were assessed using the Tool for the
   Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts
   (TRACI). Monte Carlo Analysis was conducted to investigate the processes
   with major contribution in each impact category. The market opportunity
   for each co-product was examined based on supply, demand and prices of
   the products that could potentially be substituted by the co-products.
   The results indicated that the scenario with the least life-cycle
   environmental impacts in all the five impact categories with the highest
   net energy ratio was the scenario utilizing a multitude of co-products
   including bioethanol from lipid-extracted microalgae (LEA), biomethane
   (to produce electricity and heat) from simultaneous
   saccharification-fermentation (SSF) residues, land-applied material from
   SSF residue anaerobic digestion (AD) solid digestate, recycling
   nutrients from SSF residue AD liquid digestate and CO2 recovered from
   SSF process contributed. Decreasing the energy consumption of the
   centrifuge in the land-applied material production process and
   increasing the lipid content of microalgae can reduce environmental
   footprints of the co-products. The same scenario also had the highest
   total income indicating their potential as co-products in the market.

AB Algal bloom microalgae are abundant in polluted water systems, but their
   biocrude oil production potential via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is
   limited. This study proposed a novel process that combined biological
   (dark fermentation) and thermochemical (HTL) techniques aimed at
   changing the feedstock characteristics to be more suitable for
   thermochemical conversion, herein named integrated dark
   fermentation-hydrothermal liquefaction (DF-HTL). DF-HTL conversion of
   algae significantly enhanced the biocrude oil yield (wt %), carbon
   content (mol), energy content (MJ), and energy conversion ratios by 9.8,
   29.7, 40.0, and 61.0%, respectively, in comparison to the control.
   Furthermore, DF-HTL processing significantly decreased the aqueous
   byproduct yield (wt %), carbon content (mol), nitrogen content (mol),
   and ammonia content (mol) by 19.0, 38.4, 25.0, and 13.2%, respectively,
   in comparison to the control. Therefore, DF-HTL reduced the
   environmental impact associated with disposing of the wastewater
   byproduct. However, DF-HTL also augmented the nitrogen content (mol) of
   the biocrude oil by 42.2% in comparison to the control. The benefits of
   DF-HTL were attributed to the increased acid content, the incorporation
   of H2 as a processing gas, and the enhancement of the Maillard reaction,
   which shifted the distribution of reaction products from the aqueous
   phase to the biocrude oil phase. This article provides insights into the
   efficacy of a novel integrated biological-thermochemical processing
   method with distinct environmental and energetic advantages over
   conventional HTL that heightens the biocrude oil yield for feedstocks
   with a high carbohydrate and a high protein content.

   temperature was evaluated by using the method of Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA). The energy efficiency and environment emissions were under

   was 1 kg microalgae. It was concluded that the harvest stage was
   responsible for the main energy consumption during the microalgal whole
   pyrolysis process. The energy conversion efficiency of the whole process
   was larger than 1, which indicated that the process was profitable. The
   environmental impact of the whole process was 1165.67 mPET2000, among
   which the primary impact on the environment was eutrophication that
   accounts for 57.36%, followed by photochemical ozone synthesis (22.56%),
   acidification (17.36%); and global warming (2.73%), respectively.

U1 0
U2 19
AB Hydropower plants supply their energy needs for electricity generation
   from rivers or water canals, so these power plants cannot be used for
   sustainable electricity generation, and the best time to use these power
   plants is during peak power consumption. These power plants are less
   polluting in terms of environment than other power plants, but they also
   have negative environmental effects, such as freshwater eutrophication
   and water salinity or microalgae. This study focused its attention on
   microalgae extraction as an environmentally friendly method to reduce
   water salinity and how they can be used for biodiesel production as an
   auxiliary fuel to enhance the energy production by hydropower plants.
   The information of the sample hydroelectric power plant (Gotvand Dam)
   that was required for the processing and simulation process is stated.
   The step-by-step simulation is reviewed and the results and
   optimizations are described. The highest separation of microalgae for 1
   min electrolysis with distance of 1 cm between the two electrodes is
   90%, which reduces the salt content of the water in which the microalgae
   is grown by 13%. The maximum separation of salt from water is 19.5%,
   which is reduced to 9.5% in the centrifuge method. Water salinity
   reduction to microalgae extraction ratio is 14.45%. The optimal
   combination of diesel and biodiesel is 80%-20%. As can be seen from the
   results it is recommended to use microalgae for reducing negative
   environmental impacts in addition to increasing the power generation
   capacities of hydropower plants. Also more specific studies on terms of
   the culture of the microalgae and its individual cultivation methods for
   hydropower plants beneficial programs should be taken into account and
   be used by policy makers in the future.

AB Microalgae based biofuel has been identified as a promising renewable
   energy source, which is capable to address the climate change with the
   replacement of non-renewable energy source that leads to serious
   environmental impact. Therein, a biorefinery integrated with
   resource-recovery process which targeting biofuel productivity was
   designed along with a comparative case study to evaluate system
   performance considering both environmental and economic aspects. Such
   integrated system comprised of four objectives: (1) technological
   pathway optimization to maximize net operating margin (NOM), (2)
   resource recovery to recycle bioresidue produced from biorefinery, (3)
   utilization of external biowaste (e.g., livestock manure) to increase
   efficiency of the energy-recovery process, and (4) an overall evaluation
   on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. The proposed model was applied to a
   case study in Incheon, South Korea, where has massive microalgae
   cultivation area. The base case has compared two main upgrading options
   including conventional transesterification and the emerging technology
   of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). As per result, HTL has better
   performance of NOM and GHG emissions with the value of 8982 US$ and
   15,567 kg CO2-eqv, respectively while comparing to transesterification.
   Ultimately, the subcase that involve with energy-recovery by the
   utilization of bioresidue and livestock manure (HBOW) has shown great
   improvement which NOM is increased by 20% while the GHG emissions are
   reduced by 96%. In short, HTL is economically and environmentally
   feasible for the biofuel upgrade from microalgae. A sensitivity analysis
   has been carried out which suggesting HBOW would yield the highest NOM
   of 14,171 US$ with 40% increase of microalgae amount from the origin,
   and the NOM would have definite increase with the extra input of
   livestock manure.

AB The global challenge of feeding an ever-increasing world population is
   leading scientists' attention towards nutritious and sustainable foods
   whose production should have low impacts on environment, economy and
   society. In case the input feedstock can be waste nutrients, the label
   of such productions becomes even greener. Nutrients circularity is
   nowadays an important circular economy practice. This mini-review
   focuses on the valorisation of food waste as precious biomass to grow
   new food and feed. In particular, three functional edibles are discussed
   in the present paper: mushrooms, microalgae and insects. These foods are
   part of people diets since ages in certain areas of the world and the
   original aspect of their cultivation and breeding found on waste
   nutrients recovery is here reviewed. Proofs of such food waste
   biorefinery viability are already given by several researches featuring
   the main traits of a suitable growing medium: optimal pool of nutrients
   and optimal pH. However, lot of work still needs to be done in order to
   assess the optimal growth and cultivation conditions and the health
   security of the harvested/bred edibles. A SWOT factors analysis was
   performed.

   unclear and many scientific publications provide contradictory results.
   Here we perform the Life Cycle Assessment of the production and
   combustion of 1 MJ of algal methylester. The system under consideration
   uses standard open raceways under greenhouses. Lipid extraction and
   transesterification are carried out on a humid paste produced by
   centrifugation. Our environmental and energetic analysis shows that
   improving the energy balance is clearly the key priority to make
   microalgal cultivation sustainable and to reduce its greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. To achieve significant reduction of the GHG emissions,
   most of the studies of the literature focus on technological
   breakthroughs, especially at the production step. However, since a large
   fraction of environmental impacts and especially GHG emissions do not
   occur directly at the production facility but stem from the production
   of the electricity required for producing, harvesting and transforming
   algae, it seems relevant to question the source of electricity as well
   as algae production technology. We consider a scenario where up to 45%
   of electricity was produced by a local renewable source and then we
   compare it to the improvements resulting from technological
   breakthroughs resulting in higher microalgal productivity or biomass
   concentration. It turns out that increasing the yield only drastically
   reduces the climate change for low starting productivity. The climate
   change is always significantly reduced by the use of local renewable
   electricity. It is therefore wiser to increase biomass productivity to
   easily achievable values (10-15 gm-2d-1), and then radically change
   improvements pathways by considering the composition of the electricity
   mix used for example. At least, it must be underlined that the
   introduction of renewable electricity also affect energetic efficiency,
   leading to a positive cumulative energy balance due to better energetic
   ratios.

AB As the global demand for sustainable energy increases, lignocellulosic
   (such as agricultural residues, forest biomass, municipal waste, and
   dedicated energy crops) and algal (including macroalgae and microalgae)
   biomass have attracted considerable attention, because of their high
   availability of carbohydrates. This is a potential feedstock to produce
   biochemical and bioenergy. Pretreatment of biomass can disrupt their
   complex structure, increasing conversion efficiency and product yield.
   Therefore, this review comprehensively discusses recent advances in
   different pretreatments (physical, chemical, physicochemical, and
   biological pretreatments) for lignocellulosic and algal biomass and
   their biorefining methods. Life cycle assessment (LCA) which enables the
   quantification of the environmental impact assessment of a biorefinery
   also be introduced. Biorefinery processes such as raw material
   acquisition, extraction, production, waste accumulation, and waste
   conversion are all monitored under this concept. Nevertheless, there
   still exist some techno-economic barriers during biorefinery and
   extensive research is still needed to develop cost-effective processes.

AB Wastewater (WW) generated from the industries, agricultural and domestic
   activities produce high amounts of nutrients, heavy metals (HMs) and
   chemicals that degrades the environmental assets like land, air, water
   and culminates in human and animal health hazards. The conventional
   techniques of remediation are inefficient and eco-hazardous compared to
   the non-conventional which are cost-effective, reliable and ecofriendly.
   The utilization of biological agents for the remediation of natural
   assets is known as bioremediation. Phycoremediation (a bioremediation
   technique) strategies cater to the possibility of using algal diversity
   to remediate hazardous contaminants (hydrocarbons, pesticides,
   radioactive matter, HMs etc.) while also valorizing the treated biomass
   for the manufacture of value-added goods (fertilizers, biofuel etc.).
   Apart from being a carbon sink, algae have a significant
   surface-to-volume ratio, for biosorption (due to metal-binding groups on
   cell surfaces), bioconcentration, and biotransformation of pollutants.
   After reviewing the extant literature (170 publications), we conclude
   that in future phycoremediation shall bring in a radical change in the
   existing wastewater treatment (WWT) regimes for the benefit of mankind
   through the concept of circular economy. Meticulous studies and joint
   efforts of the academia and industries should focus on developing and
   conserving hyperaccumulator microalgal strains and fully exploit their
   remediation potential against emerging wastewater (WW) contaminants to
   attain sustainability in the health and environment sector.

AB As the search for alternatives to fossil fuels continues, microalgae
   have emerged as a promising renewable feedstock for biodiesel. Many
   species contain high lipid concentrations and require simple cultivation
   - including reduced freshwater and land area needs - compared to
   traditional crops used for biofuels. Recently, technological
   advancements have brought microalgae biodiesel closer to becoming
   economically feasible through increased efficiency of the cultivation,
   harvesting, pretreatment, lipid extraction, and transesterification
   subsystems. The metabolism of microalgae can be favorably manipulated to
   increase lipid productivity through environmental stressors, and "green"
   techniques such as using flue gas as a carbon source and wastewater as a
   media replacement can lower the environmental impact of biodiesel
   production. Through life cycle assessment and the creation of process
   models, valuable insights have been made into the energy and material
   sinks of the manufacturing process, helping to identify methods to
   successfully scale up microalgae biodiesel production. Several companies
   are already exploring the microalgae industry, offsetting operating
   costs through isolation of co-products and careful unit operation
   selection. With numerous examples drawn from industry and the
   literature, this review provides a practical approach for creating a
   microalgae biodiesel facility.

AB A life cycle assessment (LCA) and an energy balance analysis of marine
   microalgal biomass production were conducted to determine the
   environmental impacts and the critical points of production for large
   scale planning. The artificial lighting and temperature conditions of an
   indoor bubble column photobioreactor (bcPBR) were compared to the
   natural conditions of an equivalent outdoor system. Marine microalgae,
   belonging to the dinoflagellate and raphidophyte groups, were cultured
   and the results were compared with published LCA data obtained from
   green microalgae (commonly freshwater algae). Among the species tested,
   Alexandrium minutum was chosen as the target marine microalgae for
   biomass production under outdoor conditions, although there were no
   substantial differences between any of the marine microalgae studied.
   Under indoor culture conditions, the total energy input for A. minutum
   was 923 MJ kg-1 vs. 139 MJ kg-1 for outdoor conditions. Therefore, a
   greater than 85% reduction in energy requirements was achieved using
   natural environmental conditions, demonstrating the feasibility of
   outdoor culture as an alternative method of bioenergy production from
   marine microalgae. The growth stage was identified as the principal
   source of energy consumption for all microalgae tested, due to the
   electricity requirements of the equipment, followed by the construction
   material of the bcPBR. The global warming category (GWP) was 6 times
   lower in outdoor than in indoor conditions. Although the energy balance
   was negative under both conditions, this study concludes with
   suggestions for improvements in the outdoor system that would allow
   up-scaling of this biomass production technology for outdoor conditions
   in the Mediterranean.

AB Microalgae offer promising and multifaceted solutions to the ongoing
   issues regarding energy security and climate change. One of the major
   bottlenecks in utilizing algal biomass is the excessive amount of
   moisture to be managed after harvest, which translates to costs in the
   dewatering step. Newer strategies have been developed to be able to
   convert algal biomass feedstock to biodiesel without the need for
   extraction and drying, such as in-situ transesterification. This process
   can be improved by concurrently subjecting the system under subcritical
   conditions, which could also potentially remove the use of catalysts as
   well as offer tolerance to free fatty acid content of the feedstock. A
   definitive screening design of experiment was utilized to provide an
   acceptable prediction on the effects of key process parameters -
   temperature, reaction time, and solvent-to-solid ratio to the obtainable
   fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield and process power consumption. The
   optimum operating condition, which combines the benefits of maximizing
   the FAME yield and minimizing the process power consumption was found to
   be at 220°C, 2 h, and 8 ml methanol per gram of biomass (80 wt%
   moisture). This produces a FAME yield of 74.6% with respect to the
   maximum obtainable FAME. Sensitivity analysis discussed the implications
   regarding the weight of importance between the two responses of
   interest. The benefits of the proposed process can be observed when
   compared to its conventional transesterification counterpart in terms of
   energy savings and reduced environmental impact. Hence, this process
   offers a feasible alternative to produce biodiesel from microalgae.

AB The process of looking for alternative energy sources is driven by the
   increasing demand for energy and environmental contamination caused by
   using fossil fuels. Recent investigations reported the efficiency of
   microalgae for biofuel production due to its low cost of production,
   high speed of growth, and ability to grow in harsh environments. In
   addition, many microalgae are photosynthetic, consuming CO2 and solar
   light to grow in biomass and providing a promising bioenergy source.
   This review presents the recent advances in the application of
   microalgae for biofuel production. In addition, cultivation and
   harvesting systems and environmental factors that affect microalgae
   cultivation for biofuel production have also been discussed. Moreover,
   lipid extraction and conversion technologies to biofuel are presented.
   The mixotrophic cultivation strategy is promising as it combines the
   advantages of heterotrophy and autotrophy. Green harvesting methods such
   as using bio-coagulants and flocculants are promising technologies to
   reduce the cost of microalgal biomass production. In the future, more
   investigations into co-cultivation systems, new green harvesting
   methods, high lipids extraction methods, and the optimization of lipid
   extraction and converting processes should be implemented to increase
   the sustainability of microalgae application for biofuel production.

AB It has been recognized that oils derived from microorganism and
   wastewater sludge are comparable replacements of traditional biodiesel
   production feedstock, which is energy intensive and costly. Energy
   balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are essential factors to
   assess the feasibility of the production. This study evaluated the
   energy balance and GHG emissions of biodiesel production from microbial
   and wastewater sludge oil. The results show that energy balance and GHG
   emissions of biodiesel produced from microbial oil are significantly
   impacted by the cultivation methods and carbon source. For phototrophic
   microorganism (microalgae), open pond system gives 3.6 GJ higher energy
   gain than photo bioreactor system in per tonne biodiesel produced. For
   heterotrophic microorganisms, the energy balance depends on the type of
   carbon source. Three carbon sources including starch, cellulose, and
   starch industry wastewater (SIW) used in this study showed that
   utilization of SIW as carbon source provided the most favorable energy
   balance. When oil extracted from municipal sludge is used for biodiesel
   production, the energy gain is up to 29.7 GJ per tonne biodiesel
   produced, which is higher than the energy gain per tonne of biodiesel
   produced from SIW cultivated microbes. GHG emissions study shows that
   biodiesel production from microbes or sludge oil is a net carbon dioxide
   capture process except when starch is used as raw material for microbial
   oil production, and the highest capture is around 40 tonnes carbon
   dioxide per tonne of biodiesel produced.

AB Full feedstock potential needs to be tapped to make lignocellulosic
   ethanol an economically viable reality. This work focuses on the
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae ethanol fermentation of fresh sorghum
   carbohydrates extracted through a mild steam-treatment process, and the
   subsequent Chlorella vulgaris cultivation using the generated liquid and
   gaseous fermentation effluents. The first section of the manuscript
   focuses on the effect of nutrient addition (fermentation effluent, yeast
   extract and urea) on the conversion efficiency of the sorghum
   carbohydrates to ethanol. Overall, the fermentation time was reduced to
   half when yeast extract and urea were supplemented to the free and
   hemicellulosic carbohydrate stream, accelerating the total sugar
   consumption time from 24 h to under 12 h. However, regarding the
   cellulosic carbohydrate hydrolysate, the sole addition of urea resulted
   in a slight improvement of the fermentation kinetics. The second half of
   the manuscript presents the impact of these different fermentation
   effluents and various process parameters (addition of yeast extract,
   antibiotic and CO2) on the microalgal cultivation and composition. The
   cellulosic hydrolysate yielded the highest concentrations of microalgal
   carbohydrates (507 mg/L) under a CO2-rich environment. Further
   cultivation scale-up assays confirmed these observations in the presence
   of 10% CO2 using the mixed fermentation effluents of the free and
   constitutive sorghum carbohydrates. Thus, an integrated sorghum-based
   first- (free carbohydrates), second- (constitutive carbohydrates) and
   third-generation (microalgal carbohydrates) ethanol production process
   was thoroughly investigated. This work could represent a step towards
   bridging the gap leading to full-scale commercialization of these
   advanced-biofuel technologies.

TI Microalgae to biodiesel: a novel green conversion method for

   acid methyl esters.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 357
PY 2024
U1 4
U2 6
AB Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions due to increasing energy demand have
   raised the need to identify effective solutions to produce clean and
   renewable energy. Biotechnologies are an effective platform to attain
   green transition objectives, especially when synergically integrated to
   promote health and environmental protection. In this context,
   microalgae-based biotechnologies are considered among the most effective
   tools for treating gaseous effluents and simultaneously capturing carbon
   sources for further biomass valorisation. The production of biodiesel is
   regarded as a promising avenue for harnessing value from residual algal
   biomass. Nonetheless, the existing techniques for extracting lipids
   still face certain limitations, primarily centred around the
   cost-effectiveness of the process. This study is dedicated to developing
   and optimising an innovative and cost-efficient technique for extracting
   lipids from algal biomass produced during gaseous emissions treatment
   based on algal-bacterial biotechnology. This integrated treatment
   technology combines a bio-scrubber for degrading gaseous contaminants
   and a photobioreactor for capturing the produced CO2within valuable
   algal biomass. The cultivated biomass is then processed with the process
   newly designed to extract lipids simultaneously transesterificated in
   fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) via In Situ Transesterification (IST)
   with a Kumagawa-type extractor. The results of this study demonstrated
   the potential application of the optimised method to overcome the gap to
   green transition. Energy production was obtained from residuals produced
   during the necessary treatment of gaseous emissions. Using
   hexane-methanol (v/v = 19:1) mixture in the presence KOH in Kumagawa
   extractor lipids were extracted with extraction yield higher than 12%
   and converted in fatty acid methyl esters. The process showed the
   enhanced extraction of lipids converted in bio-sourced fuels with
   circular economy approach, broadening the applicability of
   biotechnologies as sustainable tools for energy source diversification.

U1 2
U2 16
AB Besides reducing the sewage organic and nutrient load, microalgae-based
   wastewater treatments promote the recovery of important natural
   resources, such as N and P, which can be used for biofuels and animal
   feed production. In this context, the present study proposes a treatment
   system based on a circular economy and resource recovery of waste
   streams: an up-flow anaerobic reactor (UASB, widely used in developing
   countries such as Brazil) followed by high-rate algae ponds (HRAPs).
   Geographic Information Systems tools were used to select suitable areas
   for allocating the proposed system in Minas Gerais (Brazil). Two regions
   showed excellent suitability for allocating the UASB + HRAP system, with
   more than 70% coverage each. These areas cover 59 municipalities, with a
   production capacity of 43,565 m3/day of raw sewage, a volume that, after
   treatment, can be used for crop irrigation and fish farming. In
   addition, municipalities can produce 6621.9 kg/day of microalgae
   biomass. This biomass can generate 13.96 MWh/day of electrical energy,
   1316.7 kg/day of nutrients for animal feed, 3.97 kg of beta-carotene,
   2576.3 kg of biodiesel, 132.4 kg of Omega-3, 198.7 kg of glycerol or
   1125.72 kg of ethanol. Productivities were calculated from three
   by-product valorization routes of the suggested system: energy,
   agriculture, and high-value products. The proposed system improves
   current wastewater treatment standards in the selected regions, with the
   potential to generate valuable resources compatible with attractive
   economic activities from these areas.

AB A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed on a putative biodiesel
   production plant in which the freshwater alga Chlorella vulgaris, was
   grown using an existing system similar to a published commercial-scale
   hybrid cultivation. The hybrid system couples airlift tubular
   photobioreactors with raceway ponds in a two-stage process for high
   biomass growth and lipid accumulation. The results show that microalgal
   biodiesel production would have a significantly lower environmental
   impact than fossil-derived diesel. Based on the functional unit of 1 ton
   of biodiesel produced, the hybrid cultivation system and hypothetical
   downstream process (base case) would have 42% and 38% savings in global
   warming potential (GWP) and fossil-energy requirements (FER) when
   compared to fossil-derived diesel, respectively. Sensitivity analysis
   was performed to identify the most influential process parameters on the
   LCA results. The maximum reduction in GWP and FER was observed under
   mixotrophic growth conditions with savings of 76% and 75% when compared
   to conventional diesel, respectively.

U1 6

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are bioelectrochemical devices that allow
   the harvesting of electricity generated during anaerobic respiration of
   selected bacterial species. This technology shows promise in both
   wastewater treatment and sustainable bioenergy conversion applications.
   Bacterial respiration occurs in the anaerobic anode compartment of the
   MFC, and is electrochemically coupled with electron acceptors in the
   MFC's aerobic cathode compartment. This paper summarizes the published
   results of bacterio-algal MFCs. The use of microalgae in MFCs has gained
   interest primarily due to algae's ability to photosynthesize atmospheric
   CO2, producing both biomass and oxygen and thereby facilitating the
   cathodic reaction. These phototrophic microorganisms can serve as
   biocatholytes in MFCs because the oxygen produced is an electron
   acceptor for the electrons harvested from the anode compartment. The
   bacterio-algal MFC can provide multiple benefits including (1) power
   generation, (2) wastewater treatment, (3) algal biomass cultivation and
   pigment production, (4) carbon dioxide assimilation, and (5) oxygen
   production. This review article summarizes not only successful published
   results of bacterio-algal fuel cells but also highlights critical
   operational parameters and their effect on power generation and output
   efficiency.

   in relation to lutein, for which commercial plant sources are lacking.
   Research efforts, manifested in numerous reviews and research papers
   published in the last decade, have been directed to green extraction,
   microencapsulation/nanoencapsulation, and valorization of processing
   by-products. Extraction is shifting from conventional extraction with
   organic solvents to supercritical CO2extraction and different types of
   assisted extraction. Initially intended for the stabilization of the
   highly degradable carotenoids, additional benefits of encapsulation have
   been demonstrated, especially the improvement of carotenoid solubility
   and bioavailability. Instead of searching for new higher plant sources,
   enormous effort has been directed to the utilization of by-products of
   the fruit and vegetable processing industry, with the application of
   biorefinery and circular economy concepts. Amidst enormous research
   activities, however, the gap between research and industrial
   implementation remains wide.

AB The potential of defatted microalgae from biofuel production in animal
   feeding remains unclear. The objective of this experiment was to
   determine the metabolic and environmental impacts of a defatted green
   microalgal biomass (DGA,Nannochloropsis oceanica, Cellana, Kailua-Kona,
   HI) in broiler chick diets. Day-old chicks (total=180) were fed the
   control diet containing zero, 2, 4, 8, or 16% of DGA for 6 wk to
   determine the optimal level of DGA inclusion. Compared with chicks fed
   the control diet, only those fed the 16% DGA diet had lower (P<0.05) ADG
   and feed use efficiency. The DGA feeding produced dose-dependent
   (linear) increases in starter period water intake (P<0.0001, R2=0.76)
   and in wk 6 relative weights of heart (P<0.0001, R2=0.45), liver
   (P=0.09, R2=0.19), and intestinal tract (P=0.02, R2=0.19), retentions of
   soluble inorganic phosphorus (P=0.001, R2=0.39) and DNA retention
   (P=0.001, R2=0.46), and ileal DNA content (P<0.0001, R2=0.50).
   Meanwhile, the DGA feeding led to weak linear decreases (P<0.05, R2=0.14
   to 0.27) in wk 6 tibia weight and length and excretion of soluble
   inorganic phosphorus. In contrast, the DGA feeding did not affect
   relative weights of breast, proventriculus, or gizzard, tibial bone
   strength, or plasma DNA concentrations. In conclusion, this new type of
   DGA biomass may be supplemented into diets for broilers at 8% without
   adverse effects if the salt content is decreased.

SO Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies
VL 97
PY 2024
U1 3
U2 5
AB Microalgae are a group of microorganisms well-known for their high
   metabolic plasticity and biomass with commercial interest for several
   industries. In the present work, the influence of in-situ electric field
   application (INEF) on the growth and biochemical composition of Pavlova
   gyrans was, for the first time, assessed. Electrical protocols were
   tested, namely by applying INEF in different growth stages, in varying
   treatment times and even by combining it with dark phase of cells'
   photoperiod. INEF did not promote a stimulatory effect on growth but
   influenced the biochemical composition of P. gyrans - maximum increases
   of 74.9 and 66.2% in the chlorophyll a and carotenoid content and of
   4.72, 18.7 and 5.41% in the lipid, carbohydrate and protein content were
   observed in independent experiments. Hence, with this study, the
   potential of INEF application as a strategy to modulate growth and to
   promote biochemical composition alterations was proven. Industrial
   relevanceMicroalgae, with their unique ability to efficiently convert
   sunlight and carbon dioxide into biomass, offer a sustainable platform
   for the synthesis of diverse bioactive compounds. By subjecting
   microalgae to controlled electric stress conditions, their metabolic
   pathways can be redirected towards the production of specific target
   compounds. This strategy has the potential to enhance the yield of
   high-value molecules, including biofuels, pharmaceuticals,
   nutraceuticals, and pigments, whilst minimizing resource inputs.
   Additionally, metabolic stress responses in microalgae often trigger the
   accumulation of secondary metabolites with bioactive properties.
   Harnessing the metabolic plasticity of microalgae through controlled
   stress manipulation represents a cutting-edge strategy for sustainable
   and economically viable bioproduction systems that align with the goals
   of green chemistry and circular economy principles.

AB The increasing population growth and rapid industrialization have caused
   severe pollution issues caused by the uncontrolled release of flue gas
   and wastewater. By employing an algal-based biorefinery platform, the
   resource potential of these waste streams can be fully exploited and
   valorized to produce value-added products, achieving waste minimization,
   pollution mitigation, and circular economy. This review described the
   role of algae in simultaneous bioremediation and resource recovery from
   wastewater and flue gas for the biosynthesis of valuable bio-compounds.
   For flue gas bioremediation and valorization, topics such as algal
   tolerance and strain improvement, pilot-scale applications, limitations
   and possible solutions, techno-economic assessment, and life-cycle
   analysis were discussed. Subsequently, the valorization of wastewater as
   low-cost feedstock for the biosynthesis of valuable products, including
   biofuels (biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel), proteins, polyunsaturated
   fatty acids and pigments, were reviewed in detail with their
   opportunities and challenges.Chlorellasp. AndScenedesmussp. Have been
   customarily employed as platform algae for co-valorizing wastewater and
   flue gas due to their strong adaptability. Government policies, such as
   carbon tax, incentives, fundings, national research programs and others,
   which contribute to the development of waste streams valorization-based
   algal bioeconomy, were also summarized and discussed.

AB Microalgae biomass is a potential feedstock for biodiesel, animal feed,
   biofertilizer, and other products such as bioactive compounds. Most of
   the reported studies describe microalgae as a green process, however,
   the impacts associated with its growth media and cultivation have seldom
   been studied. With an aim to analyze the environmental impacts, the
   present study compares the life-cycle assessment of microalgal
   cultivation in two growth media. The data used was obtained from the
   experimental sets where microalgaeC. pyrenoidosawas cultivated in BG11
   (control or SC-1) and silicone oil nanoemulsion (previously developed
   medium or SC-2) on a lab scale. The environmental impacts were evaluated
   using the ReCiPe midpoint and endpoint method using Sima Pro 9.0
   software based on a "cradle-to-gate" approach. The total environmental
   score for 1 kg microalgal biomass production was 99.25Pt in SC-1, and
   53.39Pt in SC-2, concluding greater environmental burden by SC-1. The
   photobioreactor construction material along with the operation led to
   maximum emissions, human toxicity, and resource depletion. In summary,
   the newly developed nanoemulsion medium was found to be eco-friendly
   that has the potential to minimize the usage of conventional nutrients
   and resources.

AB Microalgae, particularly Haematococcus pluvialis, produce astaxanthin
   (AXT), a potent antioxidant with growing potential in the food,
   pharmaceutical, biocosmetic, and renewable energy sectors. This study
   proposes an integrated biorefinery model that employs advanced
   extraction processes, including bio-based ionic liquids, to efficiently
   recover AXT from H. pluvialis while minimizing environmental impact. The
   resulting platform strategically repurposes the post-extraction biomass
   as a biofertilizer, thus contributing to zero-waste objectives. By
   uniting biocosmetics, solar energy applications, and agriculture within
   a single framework, this model underscores the synergy between economic
   feasibility and ecological responsibility, highlighting the
   transformative role of microbial-derived AXT in sustainable, high-value
   product development.

AB Plastics are undebatably a hot topic of discussion across international
   forums due to their huge ecological footprint. The onset of COVID-19
   pandemic has exacerbated the issue in an irreversible manner.
   Bioplastics produced from renewable sources are a result of lookout for
   sustainable alternatives. Replacing a ton of synthetic plastics with
   biobased ones reduces 1.8 tons CO2 emissions. Here, we begin with
   highlighting the problem statement-Plastic accumulation and its
   associated negative impacts. Microalgae outperforms plants and microbes,
   when used to produce bioplastic due to superior growth rate,
   non-competitive nature to food, and simultaneous wastewater remediation.
   They have minimal nutrient requirements and less dependency on climatic
   conditions for cultivation. These are the reasons for current boom in
   the algal bioplastic market. However, it is still not at par in price
   with the petroleum-based plastics. A brief market research has been done
   to better evaluate the current global status and future scope of algal
   bioplastics. The objective of this review is to propose possible
   solutions to resolve the challenges in scale up of bioplastic industry.
   Various bioplastic production technologies have been comprehensively
   discussed along with their optimization strategies. Overall studies
   discussed show that in order to make it cost competitive adopting a
   multi-dimensional approach like algal biorefinery is the best way out. A
   holistic comparison of any bio-based alternative with its conventional
   counterpart is imperative to assess its impact upon commercialization.
   Therefore, the review concludes with the life cycle assessment of
   bioplastics and measures to improve their inclusivity in a circular
   economy.

AB Offshore production of macroalgae biomass, which was recently given the
   name seagriculture, is one of the important but least explored
   alternative energy resources. Unlike microalgae, macroalgae cultivation
   can be done offshore and therefore brings real news to the biofuel-food
   land agriculture conflict. A wide variety of small-scale laboratory
   experiments are done lately in order to deepen the knowledge and develop
   expertise in macroalgae cultivation and its downstream processing. For
   energy applications, it is common to evaluate the performance of an
   energy source or system in exergy efficiency terms. Another important
   parameter that is evaluated to determine the system's environmental
   impact is it's volumetric and areal footprint. The current work examines
   two exergy efficiency indexes, the Exergy Efficiency (EE), which takes
   into account all exergy inputs, and the Exergy Return On Investment
   (ExROI), that includes only fossil fuel exergy inputs, both on a green
   macroalgae Ulva grown in the macroalgae photobioreactor system (MPBR)
   incorporated into a building. Cultivation of macroalgae in the building
   embedded MPBR achieved maximal values of 0.012 and 0.22 for EE and
   ExROI, compared to a range of 0.05-8.34 and 0.013-0.327 found in
   published papers of microalgae systems. In addition, a modelled
   optimization of the initial biomass density leads to maximal values of
   about 0.035 for EE and 0.433 for ExROI, while further improvement may be
   achieved by optimization of nutrient addition and mixing methodology.
   This work demonstrates a tool to measure the performance of laboratory
   scale macroalgae biomass cultivation systems, followed by preliminary
   efficiency and environmental impact values, important for future
   upscaling.

AB Plastic waste from fossil-based sources, including single-use packaging
   materials, is continuously accumulating in landfills, and leaching into
   the environment. A 2021 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report suggests
   that the plastic pollution is likely to be doubled by 2030, posing a
   major challenge to the environment and the overall global plastic waste
   management efforts. The use of biobased plastics such as
   polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as a biodegradable substitute for
   petroleum-based plastics could be a feasible option to combat this issue
   which may further result in much lower carbon emissions and energy usage
   in comparison to conventional plastics as additional advantages. Though
   recent years have seen the use of microbes as biosynthetic machinery for
   biobased plastics, using various renewable feedstocks, the scaled-up
   production of such materials is still challenging. The current study
   outlays applications of biobased plastics, potential microorganisms
   producing biobased plastics such as Cupriavidus necator, Bacillus sp.,
   Rhodopseudomonas palustris, microalgae, and mixed microbial cultures,
   and inexpensive and renewable resources as carbon substrates including
   industrial wastes. This review also provides deep insights into the
   operational parameters, challenges and mitigation, and future
   opportunities for maximizing the production of biobased plastic
   products. Finally, this review emphasizes the concept of biorefinery as
   a sustainable and innovative solution for biobased plastic production
   for achieving a circular bioeconomy.

AB Municipal wastewater (MWW) or urban wastewater (UWW) is generated by the
   domestic consumption of freshwater, which contains a huge amount of
   nutrients. The release of unprocessed wastewater causes eutrophication
   and harms aquatic life. Moreover, ingestion of polluted MWW causes a
   severe negative impact on human health. Microalgae are unicellular,
   eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms and have the capability of nutrient
   assimilation in the presence of light. Moreover, the produced biomass
   can be used for the generation of value-added bioproducts such as
   bioenergy. However, conventional microalgae-based MWW treatment is not
   as sustainable on a commercial scale. Therefore, more advanced
   approaches using microalgae need to be integrated in wastewater
   cultivation systems to improve nutrient removal efficiency. Thus, the
   present review explores the use of microalgae for the removal of
   nutrients from MWW, provides an outlook of direct and indirect methods
   of nutrient uptake from wastewater and the effects of the influencing
   factors in biomass growth. Moreover, the review also gives insight into
   recent approaches used for MWW treatment and the applications of algal
   biomass resulting from treated wastewater. It is predicted that
   microalgae-based MWW treatment systems will be a significant green
   approach to help eliminate nutrient loads and implement circular
   economy.

PY 2023
U1 2
U2 14
AB The transportation sector significantly contributes to global warming
   due to the extensive use of fossil fuels. Biofuels have the potential to
   eliminate inherent problems associated with the combustion of fossil
   fuels. However, large-scale deployment of biorefineries is limited
   because of high capital and operating costs as well as the low market
   value of biofuels that make such plants economically unfavorable.
   Additionally, using sustainable feedstock (algae, cyanobacteria, etc.),
   i.e., with no social, environmental, or technological challenges, is
   another major bottleneck for biorefineries. Considering these
   challenges, this study presents a strategy for the commercialization of
   macroalga-derived bioethanol via a circular economy-based integrated
   biorefinery concept. A standalone (conventional) process was designed
   for bioethanol production at 50.0 million gallons (189.3 million liters)
   per year capacity in Aspen Plus V12.2. Economic and environmental
   indicators were assessed through discounted cash flow and
   cradle-to-grave (SimaPro V9.4.0.7) analyses, respectively. Once the
   potential targets are identified, a novel integrated process was
   designed for biofuel and biochemical production, which is not only
   economically favorable in the current market but also has a better life
   cycle profile compared to that of a standalone process. The results
   showed that the integrated design has a minimum ethanol selling price of
   USD 0.35/L and a global warming potential of 0.35 kg CO2 eq/L of
   ethanol, which is 45% and 82.7% lower than that of the standalone
   design. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Bio-SA selling price, total
   capital investment, and seaweed price are the most critical economic
   parameters for the economic feasibility of the process.

AB The technology of flue gas CO2 fixation by microalgae is highly
   attractive in the era of CO2 neutrality. However, CO2 emission along the
   whole process has yet to be sufficiently evaluated. Here, a life-cycle
   assessment was performed to evaluate the energy conversion
   characteristics and environmental impacts of flue gas CO2 fixation from
   coal-fired power plant (Case 1) and coal chemical plant (Case 2) by
   microalgae. The results show that total energy consumption and CO2 gas
   emissions for Case 1 are 27.5-38.0 MJ/kg microalgae power (MP) and
   5.7-7.7 kg CO2 &equiv;/kg MP, respectively, which are lower than that
   for Case 2 (122.5-181.3 MJ/kg MP and 32.7-48.6 kg CO2 &equiv;/kg MP).
   The CO2 gas aeration rate and microalgae growth rate are the two most
   sensitive parameters for the energy conversion and net CO2 emission.
   Therefore, increasing the CO2 aeration efficiency and microalgae growth
   rate are key to advance the technology of flue gas CO2 fixation by
   microalgae which will contribute to carbon naturality.

AB The push to find alternatives to fossil fuels has driven research and
   consumption of biofuels. Recent actions in the United States have placed
   an emphasis on the use of renewable fuels for improved sustainability of
   government operations. In 2013, the United States Army Corps of
   Engineers (USACE) measured atmospheric emissions from two navigation
   vessels consuming three different fuel types and found that biofuels
   have the potential to lower atmospheric emissions. These fuels have
   widely different production processes, however, and a full life-cycle
   assessment is necessary to provide a complete picture of these biofuels.
   The goal of this study was to identify whether transitioning navigation
   vessels to operate on biodiesel would have the potential to lower human
   health and environmental impacts. This study focuses on the complete
   life cycle of these fuels in USACE marine vessels by employing a
   well-to-wheels life-cycle assessment comparing the impacts of a 100%
   soy-based biodiesel and an algal-based biodiesel blend to a conventional
   diesel. Overall, soybean-based biodiesel had lower impacts compared to
   algal-based biodiesel. Impacts from conventional diesel were generally
   lower than algal-based biodiesel, but impacts between conventional
   diesel and soybean-based biodiesel were mixed. While greenhouse gas
   emissions during the use phase were reduced for the biofuels (after
   considering only the non-biogenic fraction of carbon emission), a
   complete look at the life-cycle resulted in cases where emissions could
   be greater than conventional diesel. Biodiesel impacts depended greatly
   on modeling assumptions made in the life-cycle system boundaries and
   inventory such as allocation method and assumptions about feedstock
   growth and harvesting.

AB Background: The development of alternative pathways for sustainable fuel
   production is a crucial task for politics, industry and research, since
   the current use of fossil fuels contributes to resource depletion and
   climate change. Microalgae are a promising option, but the technology
   readiness level (TRL) is low and cannot compete economically with fossil
   fuels. Novel genetic engineering technologies are being investigated to
   improve productivity and reduce the cost of harvesting products
   extracted from or excreted by microalgae for fuel production. However,
   high resource efficiency and low costs alone are no guarantee that algae
   fuels will find their way into the market. Technologies must be accepted
   by the public to become valuable for society. Despite strong efforts in
   algae research and development, as well as political commitments at
   different scales to promote algae biofuels for transport sectors, little
   is known about public acceptance of this alternative transport fuel.
   Despite the advantages of algae technology, genetically engineered (GE)
   microalgae can be controversial in Europe due to risk perception.
   Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time,
   the knowledge and views of European experts and stakeholders on the
   conditions and requirements for acceptability of GE microalgae for next
   generation biofuel production. Results: The results of the survey-based
   study indicate that the majority of the respondents believe that GE
   algae biofuels could provide strong benefits compared to other fuels.
   The majority would choose to be final consumers of engineered algae
   biofuels, if there is clear evidence of their benefits and open
   communication of potential risks. They believe that closed production
   systems with high security standards and rigorous risk assessment should
   be applied to avoid unintended impacts on humans and nature. Some
   respondents, however, are not convinced about the need to alter natural
   occurring algae strains to increase productivity, arguing that there is
   a huge unexplored variety, and that the consequences of using genome
   editing are still unknown. Conclusions: This evaluation of the opinions
   held by European experts and stakeholders regarding GE algae biofuels
   provides valuable and differentiated insights, both for future research
   and for the development of feasible socio-technical algae systems for
   next generation biofuel production. The identified conditions and
   requirements for achieving public acceptability can support the
   (re-)design of this innovative technology and adaptation of the
   framework conditions towards the implementation of algae biofuels in
   Europe.

AB Anaerobic digestion is a well-established technology for energy
   production and to diminish the environmental impact of different types
   of organic residues, which are mainly produced from human activities
   (processing food) but also from other recent activities related to
   energy generation processes (biofuel production). In the present study,
   mango organic residues: mango peel (MP) and mango seed (MS), and
   microalgal residue biomass (MRB) were co-digested in different
   proportions using a mixture design. The optimized mixture proportions of
   60:20:20% of MP, MS and MRB, respectively, were determined by applying
   the simplex-centroid method to reach the highest biochemical methane
   potential (BMP); additionally, the mixture with the lowest BMP was
   selected (40:20:40%). The effects of thermal, physical and biological
   pretreatments of the selected mixtures were evaluated in order to
   improve its BMP. However, any pretreatment showed an improvement for the
   mixture 60:20:20, whereas the mixture 40:20:40 achieved an increment of
   160.1, 72.5 and 96.4%, when the substrates were pretreated by thermal,
   physical and biological, respectively. The mixture optimization of these
   substrates shows an alternative way to reduce the environmental impact,
   due to their potential use in co-digestion process for biogas
   production.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the environmental impacts of up-flow
   anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors coupled with high rate algal
   ponds (HRAPs) for wastewater treatment and bioenergy recovery using the
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. This solution was compared with
   the UASB reactor coupled with other consolidated technologies in rural
   areas of Brazil, such as trickling filters, polishing ponds and
   constructed wetlands. To this end, full-scale systems were designed
   based on experimental data obtained from pilot/demonstrative scale
   systems. The functional unit was 1 m3 of water. System boundaries
   comprised input and output flows of material and energy resources for
   system construction and operation. The LCA was performed with the
   software SimaPro, using the ReCiPe midpoint method. The results showed
   that the HRAPs scenario was the most environmentally friendly
   alternative in 4 out of 8 impact categories (i.e. Global warming,
   Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, Terrestrial Ecotoxicity and Fossil
   resource scarcity). This was associated with the increase in biogas
   production by the co-digestion of microalgae and raw wastewater, leading
   to higher electricity and heat recovery. From an economic point of view,
   despite the HRAPs showed a higher capital cost, the operation and
   maintenance costs were completely offset by the revenue obtained from
   the electricity generated. Overall, the UASB reactor coupled with HRAPS
   showed to be a feasible nature-based solution to be used in small
   communities in Brazil, especially when microalgae biomass is valorised
   and used to increase biogas productivity.

AB We present a multi-objective optimization framework for the design of an
   algal biorefinery with multiple target products. Four environmental
   endpoint indicators and the economic performance are used as objective
   functions following the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The
   process alternatives are modeled as a superstructure covering a total of
   720 feasible routes. The proposed method optimizes not only the
   superstructure route but simultaeously discrete and continuous
   parameters within the process units. A multi-objective genetic algorithm
   (MOGA) is used to solve this nonlinear mixed-integer optimization
   problem to design the extraction procedures for all macromolecular
   fractions. For the extractions, liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) are
   predicted with quantum chemical calculations. A microalgae biorefinery
   for the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is considered as case
   study, including the cultivation and extraction-supported fractionation
   of the wet algal biomass to harvest the target products eicosapentaenoic
   acid (EPA), laminarin and fucoxanthin. 2-Butanol proved to be the
   preferred solvent for the initial extraction step of wet biomass.
   Nutrients and solvent production cause most of the environmental impact
   of the overall process. A Python package for integrating LCA with
   multi-objective superstructure optimization is provided as open source
   software. It is applicable to any process system design task involving
   environmental objectives.

AB This paper presents a life cycle assessment of a simulated large-scale
   process of agroindustrial wastewater treatment through microalgal
   heterotrophic bioreactors. The study focuses on establishing
   sustainability metrics for recovering energy and nutrients from
   wastewater to produce bulk oil and lipid extracted algae (LEA) in an
   integrated process. The experimental data, obtained from a benchscale
   facility, were used to estimate the life cycle impacts of a wastewater
   treatment plant with a capacity of 16,000 m3/d, with a production of
   4.32 ton/d of biomass, fractioned in 0.84 ton/d of bulk oil and 3.45
   ton/d of LEA. The sustainability metrics of the integrated process
   indicate a net energy ratio of 0.41, reduction of 98% of the water
   footprint, global warming potential of 47 * 106 kgCO2eq/y,
   eutrophication potential of 5 * 104 kg eq PO4/y, acidification potential
   of 7 * 104 kg SO2-eq/y and ozone depletion potential of 3.33 kg
   CFC-11-eq/y. The assessment of the life cycle demonstrated that this
   technological route presents itself as a new sustainable approach for
   wastewater treatment plants and their implementation and dissemination
   can help to support a change towards resource recovery and a sustainable
   circular economy.

AB Azo dyes constitute 60%-70% of commercially used dyes and are complex,
   carcinogenic, and mutagenic pollutants that negatively impact soil
   composition, water bodies, flora, and fauna. Conventional azo dye
   degradation techniques have drawbacks such as high production and
   maintenance costs, use of hazardous chemicals, membrane clogging, and
   sludge generation. Constructed wetland-microbial fuel cells (CW-MFCs)
   offer a promising sustainable approach for the bio-electrodegradation of
   azo dyes from textile wastewater. CW-MFCs harness the phytodegradation
   capabilities of wetland plants like Azolla, water hyacinth, and Ipomoea,
   along with microalgae such as Nostoc, Oscillatoria, Chlorella, and
   Anabaena, to break down azo dyes into aromatic amines. These
   intermediates are then reduced to CO2 and H2O by microalgae in the fuel
   cells while simultaneously generating electricity. CW-MFCs offer
   advantages including low cost, sustainability, and use of renewable
   energy. The valorization of the resulting algal and plant biomass
   further enhances the sustainability of this approach, as it can be used
   for biofuel production, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and
   bio-composting. Implementing CW-MFCs as a tertiary treatment step in
   textile industries aligns with the circular economy concept and
   contributes to achieving several sustainable development goals.

AB Energy and fuel demands, which are currently met primarily using fossil
   fuels, are expected to increase substantially in the coming decades.
   Burning fossil fuels results in the increase of net atmospheric CO2 and
   climate change, hence there is widespread interest in identifying
   sustainable alternative fuel sources. Biofuels are one such alternative
   involving the production of biodiesel and bioethanol from plants.
   However, the environmental impacts of biofuels are not well understood.
   First generation biofuels (i.e. those derived from edible biomass
   including crops such as maize and sugarcane) require extensive
   agricultural areas to produce sufficient quantities to replace fossil
   fuels, resulting in competition with food production, increased land
   clearing and pollution associated with agricultural production and
   harvesting. Microalgal production systems are a promising alternative
   that suffer from fewer environmental impacts. Here, we evaluate the
   potential impacts of microalgal production systems on biodiversity
   compared to first generation biofuels, through a review of studies and a
   comparison of environmental pressures that directly or indirectly impact
   biodiversity. We also compare the cultivation area required to meet
   gasoline and distillate fuel oil demands globally, accounting for
   spatial variation in productivity and energy consumption. We conclude
   that microalgal systems exert fewer pressures on biodiversity per unit
   of fuel generated compared to first generation biofuels, mainly because
   of reductions in direct and indirect land-use change, water consumption
   if water is recycled, and no application of pesticides. Further
   improvements of technologies and production methods, including
   optimization of productivities per unit area, colocation with wastewater
   systems and industrial CO2 sources, nutrient and water recycling and use
   of coproducts for internal energy generation, would further increase CO2
   savings. Overall pollution reductions can be achieved through increased
   energy efficiencies, along with nutrient and water recycling. Microalgal
   systems provide strong potential for helping in meeting global energy
   demands sustainably.

AB Whey has applications in food, beverages, personal care products,
   pharmaceuticals, and the medical sector. However, it remains a massive
   dairy residue worldwide (160.7 million m3 year-1), with high organic and
   nutrient loads. About 42% is used for low-value products such as animal
   feed and fertilizers or is even directly discharged into water streams,
   leading to ecosystem damage via eutrophication. We reviewed the uses and
   applications of cheese whey, along with associated environmental impacts
   and innovative ways to mitigate them using affordable and scalable
   technologies. Recycling and repurposing whey remain challenges for
   remote locations and poor communities with limited access to expensive
   technology. We propose a closed-loop biorefinery strategy to
   simultaneously mitigate environmental impacts and valorize whey
   resources. Anaerobic digestion utilizes whey to produce biogas and/or
   carboxylates. Alternative processes combining anaerobic digestion and
   low-cost open photobioprocesses can valorize whey and capture organic,
   nitrogenous, and phosphorous nutrients into microalgal biomass that can
   be used as food and crop supply or processed into biofuels, pigments,
   and antioxidants, among other value-added products. The complete
   valorization of cheese whey also depends on facilitating access to
   relevant information on whey production, identifying stakeholders,
   reducing technology gaps among countries, enforcing legislation and
   compliance, and creating subsidies and fostering partnerships with
   industries and between countries.

AB Sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels are urgently needed to avoid
   severe climate impacts and further environmental degradation. Microalgae
   are one of the most productive crops globally and do not need to compete
   for arable land or freshwater resources. Hence, they may become a
   promising, more sustainable cultivation alternative for the large-scale
   production of biofuels provided that substantial reductions are achieved
   in their production costs. In this study, we identify the most suitable
   areas globally for siting microalgal farms for biodiesel production that
   maximize profitability and minimize direct competition with food
   production and direct impacts on biodiversity, based on a spatially
   explicit multiple-criteria decision analysis. We further explore the
   relationships between microalgal production, agricultural value, and
   biodiversity, and propose several solutions for siting microalgal
   production farms, based on current and future targets in energy
   production using integer linear programming. If using seawater for
   microalgal cultivation, biodiesel production could reach 5.85*1011L/year
   based on top suitable lands (i.e., between 13% and 16% of total
   transport energy demands in 2030) without directly competing with food
   production and areas of high biodiversity value. These areas are
   particularly abundant in the dry coasts of North and East Africa, the
   Middle East, and western South America. This is the first global
   analysis that incorporates economic and environmental feasibility for
   microalgal production sites. Our results can guide the selection of best
   locations for biofuel production using microalgae while minimizing
   conflicts with food production and biodiversity conservation.

AB In order to ensure food security worldwide in the face of current
   climate changes, a higher quality and quantity of crops are necessary to
   sustain the growing human population. By developing a sustainable
   circular economy and biorefinery approaches, we can move from a
   petroleum-based to a bio-based economy. Plant biostimulants have long
   been considered an important source of plant growth stimulants in
   agronomy and agro-industries with both macroalgae (seaweeds) and
   microalgae (microalgae). There has been extensive exploration of
   macroalgae biostimulants. A lack of research and high production costs
   have constrained the commercial implementation of microalgal
   biostimulants, despite their positive impacts on crop growth,
   development, and yield. The current knowledge on potential
   biostimulatory compounds from algae, key sources, and their quantitative
   information has been summarised in the present review. Our goal is to
   provide a brief overview of the potential for microalgal biostimulants
   to improve crop production and quality. A number of key aspects will be
   discussed, including the biostimulant effects caused by microalgae
   extracts as well as the feasibility and potential for co-cultures and
   co-application with other biostimulants and biofertilisers. This article
   will also discuss the current knowledge, recent developments, and
   achievements in extraction techniques, types of applications, and
   timings of applications. Ultimately, this review will highlight the
   potential of microalgal biostimulants for sustainable agricultural
   practices, the algal biochemical components that contribute to these
   traits, and, finally, bottlenecks and involved prospects in
   commercialising microalgal biostimulants.

AB Microalgae are third generation feedstocks for bio-hydrogen production
   to achieve a low carbon economy. Nevertheless, the bio-hydrogen
   production from microalgae is generally low. In this study, an
   innovative free ammonia (FA, i.e., NH3) pretreatment technology was
   first demonstrated to improve bio-hydrogen production from the secondary
   effluent cultivated microalgae during the anaerobic dark fermentation
   experiments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that FA pretreatment
   disrupted microalgae surface morphology. The soluble chemical oxygen
   demand (SCOD) release increased from 0.01 g SCOD/g VS microalgae (VS =
   volatile solids) to 0.05-0.07 g SCOD/g VS microalgae after FA
   pretreatment of 240-530 mg NH3-N/L for 1 day, indicating the enhanced
   microalgae solubilization. Dark fermentation bio-hydrogen potential
   experiments showed that bio-hydrogen production from microalgae was
   substantially improved following FA pretreatment of 240-530 mg NH3-N/L.
   The bio-hydrogen production potential and maximum bio-hydrogen
   production rate increased from 18.2 L H2/kg VS microalgae and 2.5 L
   H2/kg VS microalgae/d to 19.9-22.1 L H2/kg VS microalgae and 3.1-3.8 L
   H2/kg VS microalgae/d, respectively, after FA pretreatment of 240-530 mg
   NH3-N/L was implemented on the microalgae for 1 day. This FA technology
   follows a circular economic model because the required FA is from the FA
   rich dark fermentation liquid, which is a wastewater treatment waste.

TI Artificial intelligence and machine learning tools for high-performance
   microalgal wastewater treatment and algal biorefinery: a critical
   review.

AB The increased water scarcity, depletion of freshwater resources, and
   rising environmental awareness are stressing for the development of
   sustainable wastewater treatment processes. Microalgae-based wastewater
   treatment has resulted in a paradigm shift in our approach toward
   nutrient removal and simultaneous resource recovery from wastewater.
   Wastewater treatment and the generation of biofuels and bioproducts from
   microalgae can be coupled to promote the circular economy
   synergistically. A microalgal biorefinery transforms microalgal biomass
   into biofuels, bioactive chemicals, and biomaterials. The large-scale
   cultivation of microalgae is essential for the commercialization and
   industrialization of microalgae biorefinery. However, the inherent
   complexity of microalgal cultivation parameters regarding physiological
   and illumination parameters renders it challenging to facilitate a
   smooth and cost-effective operation. Artificial intelligence
   (AI)/machine learning algorithms (MLA) offer innovative strategies for
   assessing, predicting, and regulating uncertainties in algal wastewater
   treatment and biorefinery. The current study presents a critical review
   of the most promising AI/MLAs that demonstrate a potential to be applied
   in microalgal technologies. The most commonly used MLAs include
   artificial neural networks, support vector machine, genetic algorithms,
   decision tree, and random forest algorithms. Recent developments in AI
   have made it possible to combine cutting-edge techniques from AI
   research fields with microalgae for accurate analysis of large datasets.
   MLAs have been extensively studied for their potential in microalgae
   detection and classification. However, the ML application in microalgal
   industries, such as optimizing microalgae cultivation for increased
   biomass productivity, is still in its infancy. Incorporating smart
   AI/ML-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) based technologies can help the
   microalgal industries to operate effectively with minimum resources.
   Future research directions are also highlighted, and some of the
   challenges and perspectives of AI/ML are outlined. As the world is
   entering the digitalized industrial era, this review provides an
   insightful discussion about intelligent microalgal wastewater treatment
   and biorefinery for researchers in the field of microalgae.

AB Environmental changes that have occurred due to the use of fossil fuels
   have driven the search for alternative sources that have a lower
   environmental impact. First-generation biofuels were derived from crops
   such as sugar cane, corn and soybean, which contribute to water scarcity
   and deforestation. Second-generation biofuels originated from
   lignocellulose agriculture and forest residues, however these needed
   large areas of land that could be used for food production. Based on
   technology projections, the third generation of biofuels will be derived
   from microalgae. Microalgae are considered to be an alternative energy
   source without the drawbacks of the first- and second-generation
   biofuels. Depending upon the growing conditions, microalgae can produce
   biocompounds that are easily converted into biofuels. The biofuels from
   microalgae are an alternative that can keep the development of human
   activity in harmony with the environment. This study aimed to present
   the main biofuels that can be derived from microalgae.

VL 345
PY 2023
U1 6
U2 35
AB Wastewater disposal is a major environmental issue that pollutes water,
   causing eutrophication, habitat destruction, and economic impact. In
   Mexico, food-processing effluents pose a huge environmental threat due
   to their excessive nutrient content and their large volume discharged
   every year. Some of the most harmful residues are tequila vinasses,
   nejayote, and cheese whey. Each liter of tequila generates 13-15 L of
   vinasses, each kilogram of cheese produces approximately 9 kg of cheese
   whey, and each kilogram of nixtamalized maize results in the production
   of 2.5-3.3 L of nejayote. A promising strategy to reduce the
   contamination derived from wastewater is through microalgae-based
   wastewater treatment. Microalgae have a high adaptability to hostile
   environments and they can feed on the nutrients in the effluents to
   grow. Moreover, to increase the viability, profitability, and value of
   wastewater treatments, a microalgae biorefinery could be proposed. This
   review will focus on the circular bioeconomy scheme focused on the
   simultaneous food-processing wastewater treatment and its use to grow
   microalgae biomass to produce added-value compounds. This strategy
   allows for the revalorization of wastewater, decreases contamination of
   water sources, and produces valuable compounds that promote human health
   such as phycobiliproteins, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids,
   exopolysaccharides, mycosporine-like amino acids, and as a source of
   clean energy: biodiesel, biogas, and bioethanol.

AB Hydroponic systems generate nutrient-rich wastewater requiring treatment
   before environmental discharge or reuse. Algae- and cyanobacteria-based
   biotreatment offers a sustainable solution by combining wastewater
   remediation with valuable biomass production. This study highlights the
   dual role of Spirulina BSF in recycling residual nutrients from
   hydroponic effluent (HE) and bioconverting them into algal biomass
   enriched with high-value biochemicals. Using optimized nutrient
   supplementation combined with light regulation-100% HE supplemented with
   25% BG-11 medium, blue light, an intensity of 80 mumol/m2s, and a 16-h
   light/8-h dark cycle-biomass production reached 2.16 g/L, with a CO2
   biofixation rate of 419 mg/L/day. The biomass contained 3.05 g/100g
   florescent pigments (phycobiliproteins), 17.59% lipids, and 15.28%
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Bioremediation efficiencies were
   substantial, with reductions in COD (68%), ammonia (76%), nitrate (89%),
   and phosphate (98%). The extracted lipids exhibited a nutritional
   profile suitable for applications in nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals,
   functional foods, and animal feed. Moreover, the lipids featured
   biodiesel-grade fatty acids with a cetane number of 60 and a high
   heating value of 40 kJ/kg, emphasizing their viability for bioenergy and
   biofuel production. This study underscores the capacity of Spirulina BSF
   to integrate wastewater remediation, CO2 sequestration, and the
   generation of high-value products, thereby advancing the circular
   bioeconomy paradigm and fostering sustainable development within the
   Food-Energy-Environment Nexus.

AB High lipid content and excellent CO2 fixation capability of microalgae
   by photosynthesis have made microalgal biodiesel (BD) a promising
   carbon-neutral fuel. Nonetheless, the commercialization of BD has not
   yet been realized because of expensive and energy-intensive cultivation,
   pretreatment, and BD conversion processes in reference to 1st generation
   BD production. To resolve the issues, this study comprehensively
   reviewed the current technical developments of microalgal BD production
   process and suggested promising future studies. Current microalgal BD
   production processes highly rely on the processes developed from 1st
   generation BD process, namely base-catalyzed transesterifications.
   However, the base-catalyzed suffers from saponification reaction and low
   production yield due to high water and free fatty acid contents in
   microalgae. Vigorous pretreatments such as dewatering, drying,
   esterification of free fatty acid, and purification are required for
   high yield of microalgal BD production, making this process economically
   not attractive. As efforts to construct new transesterification
   platform, novel approaches tolerant to impurities such as thermally
   induced non-catalytic transesterifications were suggested. The thermally
   induced reactions allowed in situ conversion of microalgal lipid into BD
   (≥ 95 wt.% yield) within 1 min of reaction at ≥ 350°C. This process
   resists to presence of water and free fatty acids and does not require
   lipid extraction process. To make this process more promising, it was
   suggested lowering reaction temperature for thermally induced
   transesterifications. In addition, pilot study, in-depth life cycle
   assessment, and economic analysis were suggested to assess economic
   viability and environmental impacts.

AB The production of renewable biofuel through microalgae and green
   technology can be a promising solution to meet future energy demands
   whilst reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and recovering energy
   for a carbon-neutral bio-economy and environmental sustainability.
   Recently, the integration of Energy Informatics (EI) technology as an
   emerging approach has ensured the feasibility and enhancement of
   microalgal biotechnology and bioenergy applications. Integrating EI
   technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), predictive modelling
   systems and life cycle analysis (LCA) in microalgae field applications
   can improve cost, efficiency, productivity and sustainability. With the
   approach of EI technology, data-driven insights and decision-making,
   resource optimization and a better understanding of the environmental
   impact of microalgae cultivation could be achieved, making it a crucial
   step in advancing this field and its applications. This review presents
   the conventional technologies in the microalgae-based system for
   wastewater treatment and bioenergy production. Furthermore, the recent
   integration of EI in microalgal technology from the AI application to
   the modelling and optimization using predictive control systems has been
   discussed. The LCA and techno-economic assessment (TEA) in the
   environmental sustainability and economic point of view are also
   presented. Future challenges and perspectives in the microalgae-based
   wastewater treatment to bioenergy production integrated with the EI
   approach, are also discussed in relation to the development of
   microalgae as the future energy source.

AB Microalgal biomass-based biofuels are a promising alternative to fossil
   fuels. Microalgal biofuels' major obstacles are the water and carbon
   sources for their cultivation and biomass harvest from the liquid
   medium. To date, an economically viable process is not available for
   algal based biofuels. The circular bioeconomy is an attractive concept
   for reuse, reduce, and recycle resources. The recovery of nutrients from
   waste and effluents by microalgae could significantly impact the
   escalating demands of energy and nutraceutical source to the growing
   population. Wastewaters from different sources are enriched with
   nutrients and carbon, and these resources can be recovered and utilized
   for the circular bioeconomy approach. However, the utilization of
   wastewaters and waste seems to be an essential strategy for mass
   cultivation of microalgae to minimizing freshwater consumption, carbon,
   nutrients cost, nitrogen, phosphorus removal, and other pollutants loads
   from wastewater and generating sustainable biomass for value addition
   for either biofuels or other chemicals. Hence, the amalgamation of
   wastewater treatment with the mass cultivation of microalgae improved
   the conventional treatment process and environmental impacts. This
   review provides complete information on the latest progress and
   developments of microalgae as potential biocatalyst for the remediation
   of wastewaters and waste carbon to recover resources through biomass
   with metabolites for various industrial applications and large-scale
   cultivation in wastewaters, and future perspectives are discussed.

AB In the pursuit of alternatives for conventional diesel, sourced from
   non-renewable fossil fuel, biodiesel has gained attentions for its
   intrinsic benefits. However, the commercial production process for
   biodiesel is still not sufficiently competitive. This review analyses
   microalgal lipid, one of the important sources of biodiesel, and its
   cultivation techniques with recent developments in the technical
   aspects. In fact, the microalgal lipids are the third generation
   feedstock, used for biodiesel production after its benefits outweigh
   that of edible vegetable oils (first generation) and non-edible oils
   (second generation). The critical factors influencing microalgal growth
   and its lipid production and accumulation are also discussed. Following
   that is the internal enhancement for cellular lipid production through
   genetic engineering. Moreover, the microalgae cultivation data modelling
   was also rationalized, with a specific focus on growth kinetic models
   that allow for the prediction and optimization of lipid production.
   Finally, the machine learning and environmental impact analysis are as
   well presented as important aspects to consider in fulfilling the prime
   objective of commercial sustainability to produce microalgal biodiesel.

AB Microalgae are considered promising feedstock for the production of
   biofuels and other bioactive compounds, yet there are still challenges
   on commercial applications of microalgae-based products. This review
   focuses on the economic analysis, environmental impact, and industrial
   potential of biofuels production from microalgae. The cost of biofuels
   production remains higher compared to conventional fuel sources.
   However, integration of biorefinery pathways with biofuels production
   for the recovery of value-added products (such as antioxidants, natural
   dyes, cosmetics, nutritional supplements, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   and so forth) could substantially reduce the production costs. It also
   paves the way for sustainable energy resources by significantly reducing
   the emissions of CO2, NOx, SOx, and heavy metals. Large-scale biofuels
   production has yet to be successfully commercialized with many
   roadblocks ahead and heavy competition with conventional fuel feedstock
   as well as technological aspects. One of the prominent challenges is to
   develop a cost-effective method to achieve high-density microalgal
   cultivation on an industrial scale. The biofuels industry should be
   boosted by Government's support in the form of subsidies and incentives,
   for addressing the pressing climate change issues, achieving
   sustainability, and energy security.

U1 0
U2 132
AB Autotrophic microalgae represent a potential feedstock for
   transportation fuels, but life cycle assessment (LCA) studies based on
   laboratory-scale or theoretical data have shown mixed results. We
   attempt to bridge the gap between laboratory-scale and larger scale
   biodiesel production by using cultivation and harvesting data from a
   commercial algae producer with 1000 m2production area (the base case),
   and compare that with a hypothetical scaled up facility of 101,000
   m2(the future case). Extraction and separation data are from Solution
   Recovery Services, Inc. Conversion and combustion data are from the
   Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation
   Model (GREET). The LCA boundaries are defined as "pond-to-wheels".
   Environmental impacts are quantified as NER (energy in/energy out),
   global warming potential, photochemical oxidation potential, water
   depletion, particulate matter, and total NOxand SOx. The functional unit
   is 1 MJ of energy produced in a passenger car. Results for the base case
   and the future case show an NER of 33.4 and 1.37, respectively and GWP
   of 2.9 and 0.18 kg CO2-equivalent, respectively. In comparison,
   petroleum diesel and soy diesel show an NER of 0.18 and 0.80,
   respectively and GWP of 0.12 and 0.025, respectively. A critical feature
   in this work is the low algal productivity (3 g/m2/day) reported by the
   commercial producer, relative to the much higher productivities (20-30
   g/m2/day) reported by other sources. Notable results include a
   sensitivity analysis showing that algae with an oil yield of 0.75 kg
   oil/kg dry biomass in the future case can bring the NER down to 0.64,
   more comparable with petroleum diesel and soy biodiesel. An important
   assumption in this work is that all processes are fully co-located and
   that no transport of intermediate or final products from processing
   stage to stage is required.

   hydrothermal liquefaction and catalyst upgrading.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 368
PY 2024
U1 15
U2 25
AB Third-generation biofuels from microalgae are becoming necessary for
   sustainable energy. In this context, this study explores the
   hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass grown in
   wastewater, consisting of 30% Chlorella vulgaris, 69% Tetradesmus
   obliquus, and 1% cyanobacteria Limnothrix planctonica, and the
   subsequent upgrading of the produced bio-oil. The novelty of the work
   lies in integrating microalgae cultivation in wastewater with HTL in a
   biorefinery approach, enhanced using a catalyst to upgrade the bio-oil.
   Different temperatures (300, 325, and 350°C) and reaction times (15, 30,
   and 45 min) were tested. The bio-oil upgrading occurred with a
   Cobalt-Molybdenum (CoMo) catalyst for 1 h at 375°C. Post-HTL, although
   the hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio decreased from 1.70 to 1.38-1.60, the
   oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio also decreased from 0.39 to 0.079-0.104,
   and the higher heating value increased from 20.6 to 36.4-38.3 MJ kg-1.
   Palmitic acid was the main component in all bio-oil samples. The highest
   bio-oil yield was at 300°C for 30 min (23.4%). Upgrading increased
   long-chain hydrocarbons like heptadecane (5%), indicating biofuel
   potential, though nitrogenous compounds such as hexadecanenitrile
   suggest a need for further hydrodenitrogenation. Aqueous phase, solid
   residues, and gas from HTL can be used for applications such as biomass
   cultivation, bio-hydrogen, valuable chemicals, and materials like carbon
   composites and cement additives, promoting a circular economy. The study
   underscores the potential of microalgae-derived bio-oil as sustainable
   biofuel, although further refinement is needed to meet current fuel
   standards.

   However, microalgae wastewater technologies still have much to improve.
   Additionally, microalgae biomass valorization routes need to be
   optimized to be a sustainable and feasible source of green bioenergy.
   Thus, this paper aimed to evaluate the environmental impacts of the
   production of briquettes from MB, cultivated during domestic wastewater
   treatment. Also, it was evaluated how much the drying of the MB affected
   the life cycle and the environment. Improvements in the life cycle to
   mitigate the environmental impacts of this energy route were proposed.
   Cradle-to-gate modeling was applied to obtain a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) from cultivation to the valorization of MB, through its
   transformation into a solid biofuel. With LCA, it was possible to
   identify which technical aspect of the process needs to be optimized so
   that environmental sustainability can be achieved. Two scenarios were
   compared, one with the microalgae growth in a high-rate algal pond
   (HRAP) (scenario 1) and the other in a hybrid reactor, formed by a HRAP
   and a biofilm reactor (BR) (scenario 2). LCA highlighted the electric
   power mix, representing, on average, 60% of the total environmental
   impacts in both scenarios. The valorization of MB in briquettes needs to
   consume less energy to offset its yield. The environment suffered
   pressure in freshwater eutrophication, due to the release of 3.1E-05 and
   3.9E-05 kg of phosphorus equivalent; in fossil resources scarcity, with
   the extraction of 1.4E-02 and 4.5E-02 kg of oil equivalent; and in
   climate change, by the emission of 1.0E-01 and 1.9E-01 kg of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) equivalent, in scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Scenario 1
   was highly damaging to terrestrial ecotoxicity, with the release of
   3.5E-01 kg of 1,4 Dichlorobenzene, coming from the CO2 used in MB
   growth. This category was the one that most negatively pressured the
   environment, differing from scenario 2, in which this input was not
   required. This was the only impact category in which scenario 2 had a
   better environmental performance when compared to scenario 1. Cotton,
   required in scenario 2, represented up to 87% of emissions in some of
   the evaluated categories. Despite the impacts that occurred in the two
   modeled scenarios, the environmental gains due to the use of wastewater
   for microalgae growth, replacing the synthetic cultivation medium, stood
   out. In the sensitivity analysis, two alternative scenarios were
   proposed: (i) electricity consumption for drying has been reduced, due
   to the natural decrease of MB humidity, and (ii) MB briquettes were
   considered a substitute for coal briquettes. Results indicated that
   pressures on climate change and fossil resource scarcity were eliminated
   in both scenarios and this also occurred for freshwater eutrophication
   in scenario 2. This paper contributes to the improvement and development
   of converting MB routes into more sustainable products, causing less
   pressure on the environment. Also, the study contributes to filling a
   gap in the literature, discussing methods and technologies to be
   improved, and consequently making microalgae biotechnology
   environmentally feasible and a potential renewable energy alternative.

AB Integration of microalgae-based systems with conventional wastewater
   treatment plants provides an effective alternative to waste stream
   management. In this work, alkaline and enzymatic pretreatments of a
   microalgal culture mainly constituted by Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus
   sp. and cultivated in wastewater from an industrial winery wastewater
   treatment plant were assessed. Microalgal enzymatic pretreatments were
   expected to overcome algal recalcitrancy before anaerobic digestion.
   pH-induced flocculation at pH 10 and 11 did not enhance microalgal
   harvesting and solubilisation, achieving a performance similar to that
   of natural sedimentation. Enzymatic hydrolysis of algal biomass was
   carried out using three commercial enzymatic cocktails (A, B and C) at
   two enzymatic doses (1% and 2% (v/v)) over 3 h of exposure time at 37°C.
   Since pretreatments at a 1% dose for 0.5 h and 2% dose for 2 h achieved
   higher solubilisation, they were selected to evaluate the influence of
   the pretreatment on microalgal anaerobic digestibility. Biochemical
   methane potential tests showed that the pretreatments increased the
   methane production of the raw algal biomass 3.6- to 5.3-fold. The
   methane yield was 9-27% higher at the lower enzyme dose. Hence,
   microalgae pretreated with enzymes B and C at a 1% dose were co-digested
   with waste activated sludge (WAS). Even when the enzyme increased the
   methane yield of the inoculum and the WAS, the methane yield of the raw
   microalgae and WAS mixture was not significantly different from that
   obtained when algae were enzymatically pretreated. Nonetheless,
   co-digestion may achieve the goals of a waste recycled bio-circular
   economy.

AB Phototrophic microorganisms (microbial phototrophs) use light as an
   energy source to carry out various metabolic processes producing
   biomaterials and bioenergy and supporting their own growth. Among them,
   microalgae and cyanobacteria have been utilized extensively for
   bioenergy, biomaterials, and environmental applications. Their superior
   photosynthetic efficiency, lipid content, and shorter cultivation time
   compared to terrestrial biomass make them more suitable for efficient
   production of bioenergy and biomaterials. Other phototrophic
   microorganisms, especially anoxygenic phototrophs, demonstrated the
   ability to survive and flourish while producing renewable energy and
   high-value products under harsh environmental conditions. This review
   presents a comprehensive overview of microbial phototrophs on their (i)
   production of bioenergy and biomaterials, (ii) emerging and innovative
   applications for environmental conservation, mitigation, and
   remediation, and (iii) physical, genetic, and metabolic pathways to
   improve light harvesting and biomass/biofuel/biomaterial production.
   Both physical (e.g., incremental irradiation) and genetic approaches
   (e.g., truncated antenna) are implemented to increase the
   light-harvesting efficiency. Increases in biomass yield and metabolic
   products are possible through the manipulation of metabolic pathways and
   selection of a proper strain under optimal cultivation conditions and
   downstream processing, including harvesting, extraction, and
   purification. Finally, the current barriers in harnessing solar energy
   using phototrophic microorganisms are presented, and future research
   perspectives are discussed, such as integrating phototrophic
   microorganisms with emerging technologies.

AB Anaerobic co-digestion of source-separated blackwater (BW) and food and
   kitchen waste (FW) offers decentralized circular economy solutions by
   enabling local production of biogas and nutrient-rich byproducts. In
   this study, a 2 m3 pilot-scale continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR)
   operated under mesophilic conditions was utilized for co-digestion of BW
   and FW. The process obtained a CH4 yield of 0.7  0.2 m3/kg
   influent-volatile solid (VS), reaching a maximum yield of 1.1  0.1 m3/kg
   influent-VS, with an average organic loading rate of 0.6  0.1 kg-VS/m3/d
   and HRT of 25 days. The CH4 production rate averaged 0.4  0.1 m3/m3/d,
   peaking at 0.6  0.1 m3/m3/d. Treatment of digestate through flocculation
   followed by sedimentation recovered over 90% of ammonium nitrogen and
   potassium, and 80-85% of total phosphorus in the liquid fraction. This
   nutrient-rich liquid was used to cultivate Chlorella vulgaris, achieving
   a biomass concentration of 1.2  0.1 g/L and 85  3% and 78  5% ammonium
   nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency, respectively. These findings
   not only highlight the feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of
   source-separated BW and FW in local biogas production but also
   demonstrate the potential of microalgae cultivation as a sustainable
   approach to converting digestate into nutrient-rich algae biomass.

AB Background: A platform for the utilization of the Chlorella sp. biomass
   and sugarcane leaves to produce multiple products (biorefinery concept)
   including hydrogen, methane, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), lipid, and
   soil supplement with the goal to achieve the zero waste generation
   (circular economy) is demonstrated in this study. Microalgal biomass
   were hydrolyzed by mixed enzymes while sugarcane leaves were pretreated
   with alkali followed by enzyme. Hydrolysates were used to produce
   hydrogen and the hydrogenic effluent was used to produce multi-products.
   Solid residues at the end of hydrogen fermentation and the remaining
   acidified slurries from methane production were evaluated for the
   compost properties. Results: The maximum hydrogen yield of 207.65
   mL-H2/g-volatile solid (VS)added was obtained from 0.92, 15.27, and 3.82
   g-VS/L of Chlorella sp. biomass hydrolysate, sugarcane leaf hydrolysate,
   and anaerobic sludge, respectively. Hydrogenic effluent produced 321.1
   mL/g-VS of methane yield, 2.01 g/L PHAs concentration, and 0.20 g/L of
   lipid concentration. Solid residues and the acidified slurries at the
   end of the hydrogen and methane production process were proved to have
   compost properties. Conclusion: Hydrogen production followed by methane,
   PHA and lipid productions is a successful integrated circular
   biorefinery platform to efficiently utilize the hydrolysates of
   Chlorella sp. biomass and sugarcane leaf. The potential use of the solid
   residues at the end of hydrogen fermentation and the remaining acidified
   slurries from methane production as soil supplements demonstrates the
   zero waste concept. The approach revealed in this study provides a
   foundation for the optimal use of feedstock, resulting in zero waste.

AB Biofuels from microalgae have the potential to replace fossil fuels,
   without competing with other products derived from crops. This study
   aims to perform a cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment of the industrial
   production of microalgal biodiesel, using an autochthonous Chilean
   Phaeodactylum tricornutum strain, considering 1 MJ of biodiesel as the
   functional unit. For the compilation of the Life Cycle Inventory, real
   experimental data were obtained from the pilot-scale cultivation in a
   photobioreactor (PBR) module located in the city of Concepcion, in
   Chile. The scale-up to the industrial plant considers that PBR modules
   are of the same size as those used in the pilot-scale. The Life Cycle
   Impacts Analysis considered the ReCiPe 2016 Endpoint (H) V1.00 method.
   Results show that the whole process contributes to a total of 5.74
   kgCO2eq per MJ of biodiesel produced. PBR construction materials and
   energy consumption are the main contributors to the life cycle
   environmental impacts. The sensitivity analysis shows that energy
   consumption, water reuse and transportation distance of seawater from
   ocean to the industrial plant are the critical parameters that most
   affect the overall environmental performance of the system. The rate of
   water reuse is particularly critical to the global warming potential.
   Results also show that the valorization of co-products is an important
   aspect to improve the environmental performance of microalgal biodiesel
   production. Therefore, this study supports the decision-making process
   in biofuel production to promote the development of sustainable pilot
   and large-scale algae-based industry.

U2 9
AB Effluent and water management, in particular inactivating pathogens,
   have become more critical for the livestock farming industry, from both
   public health and business efficiency perspectives. The new hot bubble
   pilot plant (HBPP) uses hot air and hot combustion gases to produce hot
   bubbles that successfully inactivated Escherichia coli C-3000
   (ATCC15597) in the lab, in different synthetic effluents and later at
   the farm using naturally occurring bacteria such as Salmonella, E.coli,
   Thermotolerant coliforms, and Cyanophyta and protozoa spores (oocysts
   and cysts) from Giardia and Cryptosporidium from piggery effluent. Many
   industries, such as pig farms, landfills, biogas power plants, and coal
   power plants, emit large amounts of hot combustion gases. The potential
   use of these hot combustion gases (waste) to produce hot bubbles in a
   bubble column reactor offers a new energy-efficient water sterilization
   process that fits within the circular economy principals by using waste
   gases as an input for the system. This new technology would then be able
   to compete with other water-disinfection technologies, such as UV
   irradiation, ozonation, and even chlorination, due to its low operating
   costs and high energy efficiency.

AB A laboratory experiment was performed to determine the feasibility of
   coupling a conventional wastewater treatment system with an algal
   photobioreactor (PBR) for the removal of nutrients from wastewater and
   production of renewable resources. An activated sludge batch reactor was
   set up in series with an algal PBR to feed synthetic wastewater to
   Chlorella vulgaris. The nutrient concentration in the water as well as
   lipid content, carbohydrate content, and growth rate of the algal
   biomass were tested over 10 cycles to determine the capabilities of the
   coupled system. The study revealed complete nutrient removal in some
   cycles, with the average final nutrient content of 2 mg-P/L and 3 mg-N/L
   in effluent of the PBR. The algae biomass contained 24%3% lipids and
   26%7% carbohydrates by dry weight. A life cycle assessment revealed the
   highest energy demand occurred during harvesting of the algal mixture
   through centrifugation or filtration, but the highest global warming and
   eutrophication impacts were due to CO2 use and PBR construction material
   production. It is feasible for the system to treat wastewater while
   generating renewable resources, but the system must be optimized to
   reduce life cycle environmental impacts and result in a net energy gain
   before large-scale implementation is possible.

AB This paper presents an effective computational scheme using
   metaheuristic techniques for the optimization of an integrated biodiesel
   production process from microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. Ten decision
   variables were optimized including temperatures and pressures of the
   five process reactors and the number of stages and feed stage of the
   three considered distillation columns. The model is a multiobjective
   formulation involving economic and environmental objectives. The
   economic objective function is aimed at maximizing the total annual
   income. The objective function associated with the environmental impact
   is to minimize the produced greenhouse gases. Process data were obtained
   from the simulation software Aspen Plus. Models for determining the
   properties for new substances missing in the database, such as fatty
   acids present in the microalgae, were considered to improve the
   predictions of the raw material properties. The free software Symyx Draw
   was used for the creation of all the components that were not in the
   Aspen Plus database. The optimization tool that was used in this paper
   consists of a stochastic algorithm called I-MODE (improved
   multiobjective differential evolution). Likewise, a linking subroutine
   based on COM (component object module) technology and developed in
   Excel-Visual Basic for Applications scripts was implemented to control
   the Aspen Plus software for various sets of decision variables. The
   results offer attractive options for both economic and environmental
   benefits.

PS 1113-1124
PY 2020

AB Microalgal biomass offers high biomass productivity, high photosynthetic
   efficiency, and low land requirement. However, there are challenges for
   the sustainable conversion of microalgae-to-biofuels. Through
   torrefaction, microalgal biomass can be upgraded to enhance its biomass
   characteristics. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is proposed to evaluate
   the environmental impact of the production of torrefied microalgal
   biomass (TMB). Using LCA, four different conversion pathways of
   generating TMB are considered and compared. The four scenarios include
   the effect of scaling-up the production to pilot-scale and comparing two
   cultivation systems (open pond and the photobioreactor). The analysis
   includes the influence of the torrefaction severity index (TSI) on
   environmental impacts. The results have shown that TSI is directly
   related to the global warming potential (GWP) wherein the influence of
   torrefaction temperature to the GWP was higher compared to the duration.
   The impact of the cultivation system was relatively higher compared to
   the other processes due to its high energy requirement. The scale-up
   effect of the cultivation phase resulted in a reduction of the GWP by
   128% and 91% for the open pond and the photobioreactor, respectively. A
   net negative GWP impact is achieved in a pilot-scale with the use of an
   open pond cultivation system. With this configuration, the uptake of
   carbon dioxide during the cultivation outweighs the GWP impacts of
   producing TMB. Furthermore, the negative GWP result is lower compared
   with the results of previous studies on torrefaction and pyrolysis.

AB Nowadays, the fossil fuel price fluctuations are high, their doubtless
   exhaustion is distressing, air pollution is a severe problem, and these
   issues seriously threaten the global economy. Bioenergy is a significant
   alternative source, with positive environmental, social, and economic
   impacts, that can reduce the world's heavy dependence on fossil fuels.
   As a result, the importance of the design, implementation, and
   management of bioenergy supply chains have increased in recent years.
   This research, hence, is aimed to develop a bioenergy supply chain
   network design (BSCND) model to study the hybrid second (i.e., Jatropha;
   agricultural residues; and livestock manure) and third (i.e.,
   microalgae) generations of biomass. Since water and energy are two
   momentous sources for sustainable development of societies where the
   increasing demand has become a worldwide concern, the water-energy nexus
   concept is another subject discussed in this study. And since
   sustainability is another issue to be dealt with in modern energy supply
   chains, a multi-objective sustainable mathematical model is developed in
   this study to present. A three-echelon sustainable hybrid bioenergy
   supply chain model has been proposed with four objective functions that
   minimize the total cost, reduce the environmental impacts, maximize the
   energy production, and minimize the water consumption to produce
   bioenergy. The GIS-based model, also, has been used to form a
   suitability map of Jatropha/microalgae cultivation. Results of a case
   study conducted to show the model performance using the MINMAX goal
   programming method. It has revealed that producing energy from
   microalgae/Jatropha is more viable compared to agricultural residues and
   livestock manure.

AB Oleaginous microalgae and yeast are of increasing interest as a
   renewable resource for single cell oils (SCOs). These have applications
   in fuels, feed and food products. In order to become cost competitive
   with existing terrestrial oils, a biorefinery approach is often taken
   where several product streams are valorised alongside the SCO. Whilst
   many life cycle assessment (LCA) and Techno-economic (TEA) studies have
   employed this biorefinery approach to SCO production, a systematic
   analysis of their implications is missing. This review evaluates the
   economic and environmental impacts associated with the use of
   coproducts. Overall, protein production plays the greatest role in
   determining viability, with coproduct strategy crucial to considering in
   the early stages of research and development.

AB Microalgae have been investigated as a promising biodiesel feedstock;
   however, large-scale production is not currently cost-competitive with
   petroleum diesel, and its environmental impacts have received little
   attention. Using wastewater to supply nutrients for algal growth
   obviates synthetic fertilizer use, provides on-site nutrient removal,
   and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, anaerobically
   digested dairy manure was used to grow the oleaginous green alga
   Neochloris oleoabundans. In batch culture experiments with both
   synthetic media and anaerobic digester effluent, N. oleoabundans
   assimilated 90-95% of the initial nitrate and ammonium after 6 d and
   yielded 10-30% fatty acid methyl esters on a dry weight basis. Cellular
   lipid content and the N concentration in the growth media were inversely
   correlated. In addition, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids
   (i.e. C16:3, C18:2, and C18:3) decreased with N concentration over time
   while the proportion of C18:1 fatty acid increased. Although N
   deficiency is likely the primary driver behind lipid accumulation, the
   influence of culture pH confounded results and requires further study.
   Other living microorganisms in the digester effluent were not observed
   to affect algal growth and lipid productivity, though the breakdown of
   organic nitrogen may have hindered lipid accumulation traditionally
   achieved through the manipulation of synthetic media. This work
   highlights the potential for waste-grown mono-algal cultures to produce
   high quality biodiesel while accomplishing simultaneous wastewater
   treatment.

AB This research aims to assess the effect of alkaline pretreatments on the

   Dunaliella salina and the cumulative biomethane production from its
   spent biomass, within the framework of a circular economy approach using
   four biorefineries. A solvent screening was performed, with ethyl
   acetate achieving the maximum beta-carotene extraction yield (5.3% 
   0.03%). Alkaline pretreatments were applied to the initial biomass
   (direct) and extracts after a extraction with ethyl acetate (indirect),
   using two matrices: water (W) and a mixture water:ethanol (WE). Direct
   alkaline pretreatments (D) offered extracts with higher potential than
   indirect pretreatments (I) in terms of: (i) antioxidant capacity, as
   measured by ABTS.+ assay (0.690.1 and 0.610.1 mmolTE/gDW for W-D and
   WE-D, respectively, and 0.550.1 and 0.530.1 mmolTE/gDW for W-I and WE-I,
   respectively) and .OH scavenging activity (1.890.2 and 2.050.5
   mmolTE/gDW for W-D and WE-D, respectively, and 0.480 and 1.20.3
   mmolTE/gDW for W-I and WE-I, respectively), (ii) biomethane production
   from their spent biomass (30114 mLCH4/gVS and 2899.0 mLCH4/gVS for W-D
   and WE-D, respectively, compared to 23557 mLCH4/gVS without alkaline
   pretreatment), and (iii) sustainability analysis, which includes the
   assessment of the biomass exploitation for beta-carotene extraction and
   biomethane production. The most sustainable biorefinery was W-D as it
   achieved the highest biomass exploitation (33.8%), compared to WE-D

AB The demand for fossil fuels has resulted in their rapid depletion and
   rise in the fuel costs. Moreover, fossil fuels have serious negative
   impacts on the environment due to their harmful emissions leading to
   global warming. This has paved the way for research into finding a
   renewable alternative to fossil fuels and exploring potential biofuel
   feedstocks. Biofuels are non-toxic, renewable, and have properties that
   are similar to conventional fuels. Among the studied feed-stocks,
   microalgae serve as a viable biofuel feedstock due to a number of
   advantages over another plant-based feed-stocks. Algal biofuels can help
   to restore the former green environment by completely replacing fossil
   fuels. However, only large-scale production and commercialization can
   meet these requirements. Numerous studies have been conducted to screen
   algal species with higher lipid yield. Despite decades of intensive
   research, biofuels have not reached the target of replacing conventional
   fuels. This is due to the challenges at every stage of its production
   process, starting from large-scale cultivation to commercial release of
   product. Novel lipid recovery strategies can be employed to tackle these
   limitations. For example, hybrid liquid biphasic system can be used to
   decrease the production costs (Yong et al. in J Water Process Eng 38:
   101665, 2020). The aim of the review is to summarize the up to date
   research in the field of algae biofuels and to bring the focus on
   characterization and commercialization of algal lipids as a source of
   alternate energy. Furthermore, strategies to improve lipid accumulation
   and challenges associated with existing technologies are also discussed.

AB Besides biofuels from microalgae, an emerging interest in using
   macroalgae as feedstock for biofuel production is observable. Macroalgae
   have the advantage that they are much easier to harvest than microalgae
   so that the problem of low feedstock concentration does not arise. The
   environmental performance of bioethanol from onshore grown green algae
   is assessed using literature data and initial laboratory scale data. The
   optimized system model allows for producing an environmentally efficient
   biofuel in comparison to fossil fuel and bioethanol from sugar cane.
   Handling the co-product by substitution instead of energy allocation
   significantly reduced the environmental impacts of the system and
   resulted in environmental bonuses in several impact categories. Thus,
   the management of the co-product in the LCA model (energy allocation vs.
   substitution) is a key step in the LCA, as it highly influences the
   impact assessment results.

AB Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) technology is gaining interest for
   circular economy integration in the water sector. However, its
   complexity, arising from the integration of anaerobic processes with
   membrane technology, poses a key challenge. Developing an appropriate
   instrumentation, control, and automation (ICA) system is essential for
   its reliable long-term operation. In this study, an ICA system was
   developed to successfully manage an AnMBR pilot plant co-digesting two
   waste streams (microalgae and primary sludge). The ICA implementation
   enabled its stable long-term operation for 576 days, ensuring the proper
   performance of biological and filtration processes and yielding 215
   NmLCH4.gCODinf-1at 35°C. Variables such as temperature,
   oxidation-reduction potential, permeate flux and biogas flow were
   identified as key parameters and controlled. This included a 23%
   reduction in the integral of absolute error compared to a PID controller
   for permeate flow and the maintenance of a 0.5% standard deviation for
   digester temperature. These controls enabled AnMBR performance
   optimization, the rapid detection of process issues, and early
   corrective actions. As a start-up strategy to ensure proper filtration
   performance in the long term, critical flux tests were conducted,
   guaranteeing a competitive total annualized equivalent cost of 0.0016
   EUR/m3for optimal conditions. The study also calculated greenhouse gas
   emissions in different scenarios, proposing optimal and more sustainable
   pilot plant operations, mesophilic conditions, biogas upgrading through
   microalgae cultivation, and grid injection, reducing emissions by 423
   kgCO2e.tCOD-1. To ensure the viability of emerging technologies such as
   AnMBR, proper start-up protocols are crucial, including favorable
   filtration and biological process operating conditions, ICA
   implementation, and key parameter control for technical, economic and
   environmental success.

AB Microalgae is constituted by different compounds, interesting for the
   production of a wide range of end-products by using different
   technologies. Many potential possibilities have been developed under the
   context of a biorefinery. The aim of this work is to evaluate the
   environmental performance of biogas production from Spirulina
   (Arthrospira maxima) through LCA using experimental and simulation
   results. For this purpose, kinetic models for batch cultivation and
   anaerobic digestion (AD) were determined from experimental data. Thus,
   Monod kinetic model and a first order model describe well microalgal
   biomass growth and AD, respectively. This model was used to simulate
   growth of Spirulina in a continuous system by using SuperPro Designer
   9.5. Calculated results were compared to continuous experimental ones,
   obtaining good agreement in all cases. On the other hand, the whole
   process (cultivation, dewatering and AD of Spirulina biomass) was also
   simulated and the obtained results (material and energy balances) were
   used to construct LCA inventory data. Thereafter, environmental impacts
   were quantified through CML-2001 methodology using software Gabi 6.0.
   LCA results show that abiotic depletion of fossil resources (ADFR)
   category presents the highest impact, being biomass cultivation the most
   important contributor (about 56%). This result is directly related to
   the high energy consumption required for nutrient production, which also
   leads to increase remarkably the global warming potential (GWP)
   category. Main conclusion of the work is that the total/partial
   substitution of mineral fertilizers as nutrient source is the key to
   improve the environmental performance of the studied process. In this
   sense, a potential alternative could be the use of nutrients from
   wastewater or other wastes.

AB This study compiles the results of phycoremediation of milk processing
   wastewater (MPWW) and production of lipid-rich Chlorella vulgaris
   biomass using a continuous batch system operated for 12-wks. After a
   4-wks interval, a new MPWW was loaded photobioreactor to provide
   appropriate nutrient supply to algae. Results indicated that MPWW
   supported the algal growth efficiently and the maximum algal growth was
   recorded in the ranges of 400.36 to 421.58 mg L-1 during 4-wk's of the
   cultivation cycle. Average reduction in total nitrogen, TN
   (45.82-69.18%); nitrate, NO3 (93.32-94.54%); total ammonium nitrogen,
   TAN (92.94-94.54%); sulphate, SO4-2 (85.13-87.34%); total phosphorus
   (75.09-78.78%); and biochemical oxygen demands, BOD (89.53-92.40%) was
   recorded during 12-wks phycoremediation of MPWW. Harvested algal biomass
   (dry weight basis, DW) exhibited a significant content of total sugar
   (45.5%) and total lipid (39.7%). The lipid profiling results indicated
   the presence of palmitic acid (39.9%), oleic acid (21.08%), linoleic
   acid (13.13%), and other C18 compounds in algal biomass, suggesting the
   suitability of MPWW for Chlorella vulgaris cultivations. Algal biomass
   exhibited a high heating value (MJ/Kg of DW) in the range of 17.3 to
   25.1, comparable to other lignocellulose biomass to be used for
   bioenergy purposes. Results of this study indicate that MPWW could be
   utilized as a valuable medium for Chlorella vulgaris cultivation under a
   circular economy approach: wastewater treatment and bioenergy feedstock
   production. The effect of controlled environmental conditions on algal
   growth behavior and lipid composition in biomass, while using MPWW as a
   medium, could be investigated in future studies.

AB Purpose: Algal research has been dominated by the use of marine biomass
   (mainly microalgae) as feedstock in the production of second-generation
   biofuels, albeit with limited economic success. A promising alternative
   strategy is the valorisation of seaweed (macroalgae), with the cascaded
   extraction of its high-value components, as well as lower-value
   components further downstream, under the 'biorefinery concept'. The goal
   of this study was to assess the environmental performance of one such
   marine biorefinery situated in the UK. Methods: Attributional life cycle
   assessment (LCA) was conducted on a hypothetical marine biorefinery
   coproducing fucoidan, laminarin, protein and alginate/cellulose
   packaging material (target product), from cultivated Saccharina
   latissima. The functional unit was the production of 1 kg of packaging
   material. A total of 6 scenarios were modelled, varying in coproduct
   management methodology (system expansion, mass allocation or economic
   allocation) and applied energy mix (standard or green energy).
   Sensitivity analysis was also conducted, evaluating the systems response
   to changes in allocation methodology; product market value; biomass
   composition and transport mode and distance. LCA calculations were
   performed using OpenLCA (version 1.10.3) software, with background
   processes modelled using the imported Ecoinvent 3.6 database.
   Environmental impacts were quantified under ReCiPe methodology at the
   midpoint level, from the 'Heirarchist' (H) perspective. Results and
   discussion: The overall global warming impacts ranged from 1.2 to 4.52
   kg CO2 eq/kg biopolymer, with the application of economic allocation;
   3.58 to 7.06 kg CO2eq/kg with mass allocation and 14.19 to 41.52 kg
   CO2eq/kg with system expansion - the lower limit representing the
   instance where green electricity is used and the upper where standard
   electricity is employed. While implementing the green energy mix
   resulted in a 67% reduction in global warming impacts, it also incurred
   a 2-9 fold increase in overall impacts in the categories of terrestrial
   acidification, human non-carcinogenic toxicity, land-use and terrestrial
   ecotoxicity. Economic allocation resulted in burden shifting most
   favourable to the packaging material pathway. Conclusions: This study
   demonstrates that the road to environmental optimisation in marine
   biorefineries is fraught with trade-offs. From the perspective of LCA -
   and by extension, the eco-design process that LCA is used to inform -
   when evaluating such product systems, it serves to strike a balance
   between performance across a broad spectrum of environmental impact
   categories, along with having consideration for the nature of energy
   systems incorporated and LCA methodological elements.

AB Blue carbon has made significant contributions to climate change
   adaptation and mitigation while assisting in achieving co-benefits such
   as aquaculture development and coastal restoration, winning
   international recognition. Climate change mitigation and co-benefits
   from blue carbon ecosystems are highlighted in the recent
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Ocean and
   Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. Its diverse nature has resulted in
   unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, with conservationists,
   academics, and politicians working together to achieve common goals such
   as climate change mitigation and adaptation, which need proper policy
   regulations, funding, and multi-prong and multi-dimensional strategies
   to deal with. An overview of blue carbon habitats such as seagrass beds,
   mangrove forests, and salt marshes, the critical role of blue carbon
   ecosystems in mitigating plastic/micro-plastic pollution, as well as the
   utilization of the above-mentioned blue carbon resources for biofuel
   production, are critically presented in this research. It also
   highlights the concerns about blue carbon habitats. Identifying and
   addressing these issues might help preserve and enhance the ocean's
   ability to store carbon and combat climate change and mitigate
   plastic/micro-plastic pollution. Checking out their role in carbon
   sequestration and how they act as the major carbon sinks of the world
   are integral parts of this study. In light of the global frameworks for
   blue carbon and the inclusion of microalgae in blue carbon, blue carbon
   ecosystems must be protected and restored as part of carbon stock
   conservation efforts and the mitigation of plastic/micro-plastic
   pollution. When compared to the ecosystem services offered by
   terrestrial ecosystems, the ecosystem services provided by coastal
   ecosystems, such as the sequestration of carbon, the production of
   biofuels, and the remediation of pollution, among other things, are
   enormous. The primary purpose of this research is to bring awareness to
   the extensive range of beneficial effects that can be traced back to
   ecosystems found in coastal environments.

TI Potential use of algae for the bioremediation of different types of

   green circular economy.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 324

AB Remediation by algae is a very effective strategy for avoiding the use
   of costly, environmentally harmful chemicals in wastewater treatment.
   Recently, industries based on biomass, especially the bioenergy sector,
   are getting increasing attention due to their environmental
   acceptability. However, their practical application is still limited due
   to the growing cost of raw materials such as algal biomass, harvesting
   and processing limitations. Potential use of algal biomass includes
   nutrients recovery, heavy metals removal, COD, BOD, coliforms, and other
   disease-causing pathogens reduction and production of bioenergy and
   valuable products. However, the production of algal biomass using the
   variable composition of different wastewater streams as a source of
   growing medium and the application of treated water for subsequent use
   in agriculture for irrigation has remained a challenging task. The
   present review highlights and discusses the potential role of algae in
   removing beneficial nutrients from different wastewater streams with
   complex chemical compositions as a biorefinery concept and subsequent
   use of produced algal biomass for bioenergy and bioactive compounds.
   Moreover, challenges in producing algal biomass using various wastewater
   streams and ways to alleviate the stress caused by the toxic and high
   concentrations of nutrients in the wastewater stream have been discussed
   in detail. The technology will be economically feasible and publicly
   accepted by reducing the cost of algal biomass production and reducing
   the loaded or attached concentration of micropollutants and pathogenic
   microorganisms. Algal strain improvement, consortium development,
   biofilm formation, building an advanced cultivation reactor system,
   biorefinery concept development, and life-cycle assessment are all
   possible options for attaining a sustainable solution for sustainable
   biofuel production. Furthermore, producing valuable compounds, including
   pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and pigment contents generated from algal
   biomass during biofuel production, could also help reduce the cost of
   wastewater management by microalgae.

AB Microalgae have attracted increasing attention as a potential feedstock
   for biofuel production. However, direct high-density ethanol production
   from microalgae is not commercially feasible due to the requirement for
   complex pre-treatments and insufficient enzymatic hydrolysis. In this
   study, we successfully developed a consolidated bioprocessing (CBP)
   system using recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae displaying synergistic
   cellulases/amylases on cell surfaces to overcome energy-conversion
   limitations. As Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4 can accumulate considerable
   amounts of carbohydrates and pigments (i.e., lutein), performing four
   rounds of pigment extraction from wet microalgal biomass using acetone
   was found to significantly eliminate the need for biomass pre-treatment
   and increase commercial viability. The pigment-extracted JSC4 residues
   increased ethanol production by 10.7% and 31.6% compared to raw starch
   and whole JSC4 cells, respectively. The theoretical ethanol production
   mass and yield from 300 g L-1 of JSC4 material were 73 g L-1 and 64%,
   respectively, after fermentation for 72 h in the presence of amylase-
   and cellulase-displaying yeasts, which are dramatically higher than
   those reported previously. Life cycle assessment (LCA) further revealed
   that this CBP system has 2.7- to 10.7-fold lower total environmental
   impact compared to alternative ethanol production methods using
   microalgal biomass. 2.43 kg ethanol and additional products of 5 g
   lutein from 1 kg microalgal biomass significantly increased the total
   economic output to $60.875. Overall, this study successfully
   demonstrates a feasible cell-surface display fermentation system for use
   in direct high-density ethanol production from pigment-extracted
   microalgal material.

AB The present work focuses on the use of defatted biomass of the
   microalgaNannochloropsissp. from the biodiesel industry, as a partial
   substitute of fish meal (FM) in diets for European sea bass. The effects
   of increasing inclusion levels of microalgal meal on growth performance,
   body composition, nutrient utilization, gut morphology, and innate
   immunity were evaluated after 93 days. A reference alga-free diet was
   the control (CTRL) diet, and the three experimental diets contained 5
   (MA5), 10 (MA10), and 15% (MA15) of the microalgal meal. The
   microalga-rich diets were supplemented with DL-methionine to assure sea
   bass dietary requirement. Overall, nutrient apparent digestibilities
   (ADCs) of the diets were not altered by the microalgal inclusion, but
   energy ADC was highest in fish fed the CTRL diet (90% vs 88%). At the
   end of the trial, fish growth performance was similar among dietary
   treatments (DGI of 1.0), but fish fed MA10 had a significantly higher
   feed conversion ratio than those fed CTRL and MA5. Final whole body
   composition and nutrient gain of fish fed the different diets were
   similar. No significant differences were detected in gut morphology
   among treatments. Innate immune parameters (lysozyme, alternative
   complement pathway - ACH50, and peroxidase) were examined, and ACH50 of
   the fish fed MA15 was significantly lower than those fed MA10,
   suggesting a dose-dependent stimulation of the innate immune response.
   The present results indicate that defatted microalgal meal can replace
   fishmeal in European sea bass diets - at inclusion levels of up to 15% -
   contributing to a circular economy approach.

AB The need for efficient and clean biomass conversion technologies has
   propelled Hydrothermal (HT) processing as a promising treatment option
   for biofuel production. This manuscript discussed its application for
   pre-treatment of microalgae biomass to solid (biochar), liquid (biocrude
   and biodiesel) and gaseous (hydrogen and methane) products via
   Hydrothermal Carbonisation (HTC), Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) and
   Supercritical Water Gasification (SCWG) as well as the utility of HT
   water as an extraction medium and HT Hydrotreatment (HDT) of algal
   biocrude. In addition, the Solar Energy Retained in Fuel (SERF) using HT
   technologies is calculated and compared with benchmark biofuel. Lastly,
   the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) discusses the limitation of the current
   state of art as well as introduction to new potential input categories
   to obtain a detailed environmental profile.

AB This study approached the use of atmospheric emissions as a source of
   carbon for the cultivation of microalgae in high rate ponds (HRPs),
   continuously fed with domestic sewage pre-treated in a septic tank. To
   do so, two HRPs were used: one had CO2at a concentration of 99.9% (HRP
   1), and the other had gas from the combustion of gasoline (HRP 2).
   Biomass yield, sewage treatment efficiency and the economic viability of
   using these two sources were assessed. The results showed that the
   CO2source did not influence the domestic sewage treatment or the yield
   and biochemical composition of biomass, since there was no statistical
   difference (p < 0.05) between the values measured for both ponds. The
   mean yield values were 6.00 and 6.12 g m-2day-1, respectively for the
   HRPs 1 and 2. As for the mean concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and the
   percentages of removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), they were in the
   average for both HRPs (26.4 mg L-1and 31.2%). The negative Net Present
   Values (NPV) showed that in this study the investments for installing
   external CO2sources are not economically viable for any of the two
   studied sources, when the biomass produced in the HRPs is used for the
   production of biofuels and as source of protein for animal feeding. The
   initial investments, allied to the prices of the biomass, were the
   factors that mostly influenced the economic analysis, contributing to
   the lack of attractiveness in this scale. Despite this, the use of
   atmospheric emissions along with domestic sewage as a cultivation medium
   means the biomass produced in this study has less environmental impact
   when compared to similar biomasses.

AB Anaerobic wastewater treatment is still a dynamically developing
   technology ensuring the effective degradation of organic compounds and
   biogas production. As evidenced in the large scale-up, this
   technological solution surpasses aerobic methods in many aspects. Its
   advantages stem from the feasibility of operation at a high organic load
   rate, the smaller production of difficult-to-manage sewage sludge, the
   smaller space and cubature required, and the high-methane biogas
   ultimately produced. The exploitation of anaerobic reactors is in line
   with the assumption of a circular economy, material recycling by reduced
   CO2 emissions and energy consumption, and the production of renewable
   energy. Despite their unquestionable advantages, there is still a need
   to seek novel approaches and improve the currently exploited
   installations. The key avenues of research entail improvements in the
   stability of bioreactor operations and the enhancement of bioreactor
   adaptability to changing and unfavorable process parameters. The
   versatility of such systems would also be greatly improved by increasing
   nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates. Attempts have been made to
   achieve these goals by setting up separate zones within bioreactors for
   the individual steps of methane fermentation, incorporating active
   fillings to promote nutrient removal, and introducing chemical and
   physical treatments. An interesting solution is also the use of
   microwave radiation to stimulate temperature conditions and induce
   non-thermal phenomena, such as enhancing the enzymatic activity of
   methanogenic microflora. Another prospective approach is to integrate
   digesters into microalgal biomass production systems. The aim of this
   review paper is to present the thus-far technological knowledge about
   anaerobic wastewater treatment, including standard solutions and
   innovative ones, the effectiveness of which has been corroborated in
   pilot-scale installations.

AB This study utilized a renewable energy source, agricultural waste, in
   anaerobic digestion (AD) at appropriate conditions to obtain biogas and
   biomethane as an energy carrier. Maize stalks underwent ultrasound (US)
   pre-treatment for better accessibility for microorganisms, as
   lignocelluloses have a stable structure, insoluble in water and resist
   both mechanical and enzymatic attack. The digestate after an anaerobic
   digestion process was used for cultivation of algae after adsorption
   with activated carbon for clarification. Photosynthetic microalgae have
   industrial and economic perspectives, so their low-cost cultivation has
   a great potential for many applications. The results showed the impact
   of US pre-treatment of maize stalks as a sole substrate and co-digested
   with algal biomass. The total yields were 1116 cm3/L, 1350.5 cm3/L and
   1293.25 cm3/L for the untreated, ultrasonically pre-treated and
   microwaved maize stalks. The possibility of accumulating algal biomass
   using anaerobic digestate as a medium was demonstrated. US pre-treatment
   (400 W) showed high efficiency with respect to the extractives obtained
   per unit of energy input. Addition of 4 g/L of microalgal biomass as a
   co-substrate led to an increase in the biogas yield compared to native
   stalks. A small closed circle system, starting from anaerobic digestion
   of lignocellulosic substrates followed by microalgae cultivation in the
   digestate and subsequent return of microalgal biomass back in the
   bioreactor as a co-substrate was realized, encouraging circular economy.
   The suggested scheme is a simple and low-cost technology, as the
   substrate used is freely available and renewable, and algae proved to
   grow in a waste effluent as medium.

AB Trash fish feeding of cage fish can result in marine pollution. Whole
   and chopped trash fish can leach pollutants such as ammonia, phosphate
   and protein into surrounding waters. Reduction of pollution can be
   achieved by recycling the wastewater generated from trash fish feeding
   for cultivation of microalgae. Microalgae are potent candidates for the
   production of renewable and sustainable products such as feed and food,
   health and pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, industrial products, and
   biofuel. Two microalgae,Chlorella saccharophilaandNannochloropsissp.,
   have the potential to produce high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty
   acids. Furthermore, high oil content ranging from 10.7 to 13.6% is found
   inChlorella saccharophilaand up to 9.3% forNannochloropsissp. Moreover,
   these microalgae can also be utilized as a biofuel to give a mean
   calorific value of 5364 Cal/g which is higher than that of wood
   forChlorella saccharophilaand 6132 Cal/g which is equivalent to that of
   coal forNannochloropsissp. An alternative biofuel derived from
   microalgae is feasible due to the fact that they do not compete for
   arable land for cultivation and land crops for feed and food. This study
   discusses the synergistic coupling of microalgae mass production with
   wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration potential for mitigation
   of environmental impacts and a technically viable alternative energy
   resource. Additionally, the de-oiled biomass byproduct after oil
   extraction or its whole biomass can be converted into sustainable and
   renewal industrial products such as bioplastic, biopaint, bioasphalt,
   and biobuilding components.

AB The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) under the Energy Independence and

   alternative fuels per year by 2012, of which 2 billion gallons must be
   from advanced biofuel and emit 50% less life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions than petroleum-based transportation fuels. Microalgal
   biodiesel, one type of advanced biofuel, has the qualities and potential
   to meet the RFS's requirement. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA)
   of four microalgal biodiesel production conditions was investigated
   using a process LCA model with Monte Carlo simulation to assess global
   warming potential (GWP), eutrophication, ozone depletion and ecotoxicity
   potentials. The four conditions represent minimum and maximum production
   efficiencies and different sources of carbon dioxide and nutrient
   resources, i.e. synthetic and waste resources. The GWP results of the
   four CO2microalgal biodiesel production conditions showed that none of
   the assumed production conditions meet the RFS's GHG requirement. The
   GWP results are sensitive to energy consumption in harvesting process.
   Other impacts such as eutrophication, ozone depletion and ecotoxicity
   potentials, are sensitive to percent lipid content of microalgae,
   service lifetime of PBRs and quantity of hexane in extraction process,
   respectively. Net energy ratio and other emissions should be included in

AB The growing world population, rapid industrialization, and intensive
   agriculture have increased environmental impacts such as wastewater
   discharge and global warming. These threats coupled the deficiency of
   fossil fuel and the rise in crude oil prices globally cause serious
   social, environmental and economic problems. Microalgae strains can
   withstand the harsh environments of modern industrial and municipal
   wastes. The shift toward a circular bio-economy that relies on resource
   diversification has also prompted the reorganization of traditional
   wastewater treatment (WWT) processes into a low-carbon, integrated
   biorefinery model that can accommodate multiple waste streams.
   Therefore, microalgae-based WWT is now a serious competitor to
   conventional WWT since the major bottlenecks of nutrient assimilation
   and high microalgae population have been partially mitigated. This

AB The world continues to increase its energy use, brought about by an
   expanding population and a desire for a greater standard of living. This
   energy use coupled with the realization of the impact of carbon dioxide
   on the climate, has led us to reanalyze the potential of plant-based
   biofuels. Of the potential sources of biofuels the most efficient
   producers of biomass are the photosynthetic microalgae and
   cyanobacteria. These versatile organisms can be used for the production
   of bioethanol, biodiesel, biohydrogen, and biogas. In fact, one of the
   most economic methods for algal biofuels production may be the combined
   biorefinery approach where multiple biofuels are produced from one
   biomass source.

AB Phototrophic microorganisms have been proposed as an alternative to
   capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and to produce biofuels and other valuable
   products. Low CO2 absorption rates, low volumetric productivities, and
   inefficient downstream processing, however, currently make algal
   biotechnology highly energy intensive, expensive, and not economically
   competitive to produce biofuels. This mini-review summarizes advances
   made regarding the cultivation of phototrophic microorganisms at highly
   alkaline conditions, as well as other innovations oriented toward
   reducing the energy input into the cultivation and processing stages. An
   evaluation, in terms of energy requirements and energy return on energy
   invested, is performed for an integrated high-pH, high-alkalinity growth
   process that uses biofilms. Performance in terms of productivity and
   expected energy return on energy invested is presented for this process
   and is compared to previously reported life cycle assessments (LCAs) for
   systems at near-neutral pH. The cultivation of alkaliphilic phototrophic
   microorganisms in biofilms is shown to have a significant potential to
   reduce both energy requirements and capital costs.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the life cycle energy consumption of
   microalgae-to-biodiesel with low temperature hydrothermal treatment
   (HTT) as an oil extraction method. The scope covered all stages in the
   life cycle from microalgae cultivation, microalgae harvesting, HTT, and
   transesterification. In order to clarify the energy consumption and the
   material uses, a process flow diagram was determined and a matrix-based
   computation was used for calculation throughout the process. The net
   energy ratio (NER) of biodiesel and co-products of the proposed system
   was equal to 2.27. Comparative discussion of the NER obtained from this
   study and several microalgae-to-biodiesel systems has been performed. It
   can be concluded that research and development effort on the HTT process
   as well as suitable microalgae strain selection should be considered to
   obtain higher bio-oil yield as raw material for biodiesel production;
   this could improve energy output of the system and eventually decrease
   the NER.

AB Biofuel production is a key strategy for reducing CO2emissions globally
   and is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades,
   particularly in tropical developing countries. The adoption of
   sustainable biofuel production technologies that do not place large
   demands on agricultural or forested lands, has the potential to make a
   substantial contribution to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions while
   reducing biodiversity losses and degradation of native ecosystems
   resulting from high demand for land. With their high productivity per
   unit area and ability to grow on non-arable lands, microalgal biofuel
   production systems could become a major sustainable alternative to
   biofuel production from food crops (first-generation biofuels). However,
   the potential impacts of microalgal biofuels on food production,
   biodiversity, and carbon storage, compared to other biofuel production
   alternatives, are largely unknown. In the present study, the most
   suitable areas for siting microalgae production farms to fulfill 30% of
   future transport energy demands were determined within four Neotropical
   countries with high population densities and high importance for
   agricultural expansion and biodiversity conservation globally (Colombia,
   Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela). These results were contrasted with the
   best areas for siting oil palm and sugarcane crops to fulfill the same
   target in future transport energy demands. Microalgal production systems
   offer the most sustainable alternative for future biofuel production
   within the Neotropics. Meeting 30% of future transport energy demands
   with microalgal biofuels reduced land area requirements by at least 52%
   compared to oil palm and sugarcane. Furthermore, microalgal biofuel
   production reduced direct competition with agricultural lands,
   biodiverse areas, and carbon-rich systems within countries, with little
   overlap with the biodiverse and carbon-rich rainforests. This study can
   guide decision making towards the identification and adoption of more
   sustainable biofuel production alternatives in the Neotropics, helping
   in avoiding unnecessary environmental impacts from biofuel expansion in
   the region.

AB Microalgae have increasingly gained research interest as a source of
   lipids for biodiesel production. The wet way processing of harvested
   microalgae was suggested and evaluated with respect to the possible
   environmental impacts and production costs. This study is focused on the
   three key steps of the suggested process: flocculation, water recycling,
   and extraction of lipids. Microalgae strains with high content of lipids
   were chosen for cultivation and subsequent treatment process. Ammonium
   hydroxide was tested as the flocculation agent and its efficiency was
   compared with chitosan. Determined optimal flocculation conditions for
   ammonium hydroxide enable the water recycling for the recurring
   microalgae growth, which was verified for the use of 30, 50, and 80%
   recycled water. For extraction of the wet microalgae hexane,
   hexane/ethanol and comparative chloroform/methanol systems were applied.
   The efficiency of hexane/ethanol extraction system was found as
   comparable with chloroform/methanol system and it seems to be promising
   owing to its low volatility and toxicity and mainly the low cost.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel burning are recognized
   as one of the major causes of climate change, particularly global
   warming. Thus, to reduce fossil fuels and CO2 emissions, it is essential
   to take preventative steps and investigate more tolerable energy
   options. Effective combining microalgae cultivation and hydrothermal
   liquefaction (HTL) technology can reduce CO2 emissions and the energy
   cost of algal biofuel production, making it more environmentally
   friendly. However, the carbon migration in processes must be considered
   prior to industry production. Therefore, this paper reviews the
   transformation of carbon, including the CO2 sequestration in microalgae
   cultivation, the carbon conversion in HTL and the CO2 emissions of
   algae-derived biofuel. Including a summary of the conversion path and
   recovery of carbon, which are noticeably affected by parameters such as
   cultivation system, algae species, HTL reaction conditions (temperature,
   time and pretreatment methods) and upgrading catalyst. In addition,
   techno-economic assessments and environmental impact considerations on
   microalgae biofuel are reported.

AB Comprehensive life cycle assessments show that current transport
   biofuels often do worse than conventional fossil transport fuels as to
   the emission of greenhouse gases. Biofuels from microalgae grown with
   present technology and lignocellulosic biofuels from current arable land
   or land that is to be deforested are unlikely to do better regarding the
   emission of greenhouse gases than fossil transport fuels. When crops
   characterized by relatively low fossil fuel inputs and relatively high
   biomass yields are grown on abandoned agricultural and marginal soils
   which currently sequester little carbon, cropping for transport biofuels
   may help in limiting climate change without an impact on food prices.
   For such cropping one probably has to go beyond the market mechanism.
   Worldwide, there is some scope for the use of harvest residues in
   biofuel production. However, European arable soils show on average large
   losses of soil carbon and this rather favors increased addition of such
   residues to soils.

AB Microalgae are swift replicating photosynthetic microorganisms with
   several applications for food, chemicals, medicine and fuel. Microalgae
   have been identified to be suitable for biofuels production, due to
   their high lipid contents. Microalgae-based biofuels have the potential
   to meet the increasing energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. However, the present state of technology does not
   economically support sustainable large-scale production. The biofuel
   production process comprises the upstream and downstream processing
   phases, with several uncertainties involved. This review examines the
   various production and processing stages, and considers the use of
   chemometric methods in identifying and understanding relationships from
   measured study parameters via statistical methods, across microalgae
   production stages. This approach enables collection of relevant
   information for system performance assessment. The principal benefit of
   such analysis is the identification of the key contributing factors,
   useful for decision makers to improve system design, operation and
   process economics. Chemometrics proffers options for time saving in data
   analysis, as well as efficient process optimization, which could be
   relevant for the continuous growth of the microalgae industry.

TI Chlorellafor protein and biofuels: from strain selection to outdoor

AB Background:Chlorellais one of the few microalgae employed for human
   consumption. It typically has a high protein content, but it can also
   accumulate high amounts of lipids or carbohydrates under stress
   conditions and, for this reason, it is of interest in the production of
   biofuels. High production costs and energy consumption are associated
   with its cultivation. This work describes a strategy to reduce costs and
   environmental impact ofChlorellabiomass production for food, biofuels
   and other applications. Results: The growth of fourChlorellastrains,
   selected after a laboratory screening, was investigated outdoors in a
   low-cost 0.25 m2GWP-II photobioreactor. The capacity of the selected
   strains to grow at high temperature was tested. On the basis of these
   results, in the nitrogen starvation trials the culture was cooled only
   when the temperature exceeded 40°C to allow for significant energy
   savings, and performed in a seawater-based medium to reduce the
   freshwater footprint. Under nutrient sufficiency, strain CH2 was the
   most productive. In all the strains, nitrogen starvation strongly
   reduced productivity, depressed protein and induced accumulation of
   carbohydrate (about 50%) in strains F&M-M49 and IAM C-212, and lipid
   (40-45%) in strains PROD1 and CH2. Starved cultures achieved high
   storage product productivities: 0.12 g L-1d-1of lipids for CH2 and 0.19
   g L-1d-1of carbohydrates for F&M-M49. When extrapolated to large-scale
   in central Italy, CH2 showed a potential productivity of 41 t ha-1y-1for
   biomass, 16 t ha-1y-1for protein and 11 t ha-1y-1for lipid under
   nutrient sufficiency, and 8 t ha-1y-1for lipid under nitrogen
   starvation. Conclusions: The environmental and economic sustainability
   ofChlorellaproduction was enhanced by growing the organisms in a
   seawater-based medium, so as not to compete with crops for freshwater,
   and at high temperatures, so as to reduce energy consumption for
   cooling. All the four selected strains are good candidates for food or
   biofuels production in lands unsuitable for conventional
   agriculture.Chlorellastrain CH2 has the potential for more than 80
   tonnes of biomass, 32 tonnes of protein and 22 tonnes of lipid per year
   under favourable climates.

PY 2013
U1 0
U2 1
AB Algal biomass harvesting from dilute suspensions of a culture is
   challenging. Although a flocculation process is commonly used to
   separate suspended solids from water, information on the flocculation
   characteristics of microalgae cells is limited. In this study, the
   flocculation characteristics of Nannochloropsis oculata (NO) were
   examined. Chitosan addition, adjustment of the pH of the growth medium,
   and electroflocculation techniques were examined. Adjustment of the
   algae growth medium pH to 11 resulted in over 99% flocculation
   efficiency. Although chitosan addition facilitated cell flocculation at
   a lower pH (pH 9), the high flocculant requirement is a disadvantage of
   this process. In general, the efficiency of electroflocculation improved
   with increasing current, operation time (OT), and settling time (ST),
   and 97.1% NO cell flocculation efficiency could be obtained at 0.3 A, 3
   min OT, and 30 min ST. This study demonstrated that over 90% NO cell
   flocculation efficiency is achievable by adjusting the pH of the growth
   medium, chitosan addition, or electroflocculation. The process selection
   for commercial operations needs to be based on the characteristics of
   the harvested biomass required for a given application and the
   environmental impact and economic feasibility of the process.

AB Microalgae are increasingly seen as a potential alternative to
   traditional feedstocks for biodiesel, which are limited and may have
   economic, social and environmental impacts. However, processing
   microalgae for biofuels is remarkably different and poses significant
   challenges in ensuring that they are competitive when compared with the
   other feedstocks. This article describes and critically analyses the
   main aspects and methods that can be used for the downstream processing
   of microalgae for biodiesel production. A brief analysis is made of the
   current and potential biodiesel production processes from microalgae,
   focusing on their main advantages and problems. The biorefinery concept
   is also discussed, that is, how microalgae biomass can be used to
   produce not just biodiesel but also other biofuels and/or high value
   bio-products and what will enable the economic sustainability of the
   whole process to be increased.

PY 2023
U1 34
U2 171
AB Sustainable agriculture practices involve the application of
   environment-friendly plant growth promoters and additives that do not
   negatively impact the health of the ecosystem. Stringent regulatory
   frameworks restricting the use of synthetic agrochemicals and the
   increase in demand for organically grown crops have paved the way for
   the development of novel bio-based plant growth promoters. In this
   context, microalgae biomass and derived agrochemicals offer novel
   sources of plant growth promotors that enhance crop productivity and
   impart disease resistance. These beneficial effects could be attributed
   to the presence of wide range of biomolecules such as soluble amino acid
   (AA), micronutrients, polysaccharides, phytohormones and other signaling
   molecules in microalgae biomass. In addition, their phototrophic nature,
   high photosynthetic efficiency, and wide environmental adaptability make
   them an attractive source of biostimulants, biofertilizers and
   biopesticides. The present review aims to describe the various plant
   growth promoting metabolites produced by microalgae and their effects on
   plant growth and productivity. Further, the effects elicited by
   microalgae biostimulants with respect to different modes of applications
   such as seed treatments, foliar spray and soil/root drenching is
   reviewed in detail. In addition, the ability of microalgae metabolites
   to impart tolerance against various abiotic and biotic stressors along
   with the mechanism of action is discussed in this paper. Although the
   use of microalgae based biofertilizers and biostimulants is gaining
   popularity, the high nutrient and water requirements and energy
   intensive downstream processes makes microalgae based technology
   commercially unsustainable. Addressing this challenge, we propose a
   circular economy model of microalgae mediated bioremediation coupled
   with biorefinery approaches of generating high value metabolites along
   with biofertilizer applications. We discuss and review new trends in
   enhancing the sustainability of microalgae biomass production by
   co-cultivation of algae with hydroponics and utilization of agriculture
   effluents.

AB Studies involving the use of microalgae are increasingly intensifying
   for the potential they present to produce biofuels, because they are a
   renewable energy source that does not compete directly with food
   production, and because they enable the obtaining of a fuel with less
   environmental impact when compared to fossil fuel. In this context, the
   use of microalgae is directly associated to its capacity to be produced
   on a large scale and to be extracted from the culture medium.
   Rheological studies are important for obtaining the information needed
   in the elaboration of projects and equipment that will be used in
   various operations existing in systems of production and extraction of
   algal biomass. In the evaluation of different levels of dry biomass
   concentration, studies have been conducted of the rheological behavior
   of cultures ofChlorellasp. BR001 andScenedesmussp. BR003. The Power Law
   model adjusted well to the data of shear stress as a function of strain
   rate. In all concentrations the cultures showed non-Newtonian behavior.
   It was observed toScenedesmussp. BR003 little effect of biomass
   concentration on the apparent viscosity and shear stress.

AB The rapid increase in human population and industrialization have caused
   severe environmental impacts, such as the depletion of energy and water
   resources, increase in carbon emissions, and contamination of water
   bodies. Thus, innovative ways to reduce these issues are essential and
   also a challenge. In this regard, the circular bioeconomy model has
   attracted attention, since it aims the sustainable production,
   utilization of renewable resources, and conversion into value-added
   products. Microalgal biotechnology represents a promising approach to
   this concept. These microorganisms can convert nutrients from solid,
   liquid, and gaseous wastes into biomass with potential as a feedstock
   for obtaining bioproducts. The simultaneous or sequential extraction of
   these products in a microalgae-based biorefinery could be an alternative
   to improve the economic feasibility of the process. Hence, this review
   article highlights the application of microalgae to carry out waste
   treatment and produce biofuels and biofertilizers within the circular
   bioeconomy concept. The challenges and opportunities are also briefly
   addressed.

AB This paper presents a review on microalga Botryococcus braunii (B.
   braunii) with an emphasis on lipid production for possible industrial
   commercialization in biodiesel production. Summarizing the nature of
   this alga is fundamental to establish the detail environment conditions
   for optimal biomass growth and the production of lipids, as well as
   upstream processing technologies for biodiesel production. This study
   focuses the attention on identifying possible avenues for further
   investigation in the design of cultivation systems and the integration
   of process technologies at industrial scales. The advantages and
   disadvantages of biodiesel production processes based on these algal
   lipids are also analyzed. A particularly promising process involving B.
   braunii combines flue gas and wastewaters to produce lipids, converting
   them to biodiesel by supercritical (SC) direct trans/esterification
   (esterification followed by transesterification). We conclude that such
   processes using B. braunii have considerable potential for the
   production of cleaner and more efficient biodiesel than current methods,
   reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuel use.

U2 27
AB Ammonia has favorable properties for use in automotive fuel
   applications, such as good storage properties and mature production and
   distribution infrastructure. However, the sustainability of ammonia as
   an alternative automotive fuel remains in question, due to the
   significant environmental impact of conventional production technology
   and the need for a secondary hydrocarbon fuel to promote combustion when
   used in internal combustion engines. The two commercially implemented
   processes for ammonia: steam reforming and partial oxidation, a
   wood-based syngas process and a cyanobacterial process combined are
   considered in the life cycle optimization of the ammonia-based fuel
   system. It is assumed that the functional unit is 1 km travelled by a
   representative light-duty internal combustion engine vehicle. Two
   conventional fuels are also considered as secondary fuel in this study,
   namely, gasoline and diesel. Fuzzy linear programming is applied using
   carbon and nitrogen footprint as environmental objectives. The
   cyanobacteria-based process combined with gasoline as the secondary fuel
   was identified as the optimal solution. The most significant parameter
   was the end-user vehicle fuel economy. Hence, more attention must be
   given to the improvement of vehicle technology to enable the sustainable
   use of ammonia for transportation.

AB The interest in microalgae as a source of renewable fuels is still
   growing. However, the high capital and operating costs of microalgae
   farming and the non-sufficiently positive energy balance still prevent
   the development of algal fuels and algal food to commercial scale.
   Microalgae have several advantages and their potential as source of
   food, feed and fuels is very high. Microalgae can be cultivated in
   deserts or marginal lands (they do not need fertile soils) using
   brackish water or seawater. The efficiency in the use of fertilizers of
   algae cultures can reach 100% (with minimal pollution of water, soil and
   atmosphere). Their cultivation does not need pesticides. A suitable
   technology is however necessary to attain a positive EROI and produce
   cost-effective algal biomass. In the last years, the research carried
   out by our group have been aimed to reduce the inputs for algae
   cultivation. A new reactor design that integrates photovoltaic elements
   has been developed and tested outdoors. The experiments have shown that,
   by intercepting with solar cells about 30% of the impinging photons,
   electricity can be generated in a quantity sufficient to cover all the
   operational energy needs of the system (including harvesting) without
   reducing algal productivity and bring the EROI over 1.5. Together with
   new strains able to grow at high temperatures at varying salinity, this
   technology has the potential to contribute to the sustainable production
   of algal biomass for food and fuels.

AB BACKGROUND: Microalgae are one of the most promising biofuel sources
   that the world has to offer; nevertheless the conversion process is
   hampered by technical and economic problems that are mainly related to
   de-watering and extraction. The efficiency of the process can be
   dramatically improved by means of non-conventional techniques such as
   ultrasound (US) and microwaves (MW). Scaling-up feasibility is strictly
   linked to reactor efficiency, energy consumption, environmental impact
   and overall cost. In the present work, the optimization of lipid
   extraction from Nannochloropsis gaditana microalga is investigated.
   RESULTS: A series of selected solvent mixtures and procedures have been
   tested and compared. Conventional extraction procedures with
   chloroform/methanol mixtures and fast US- and MW-assisted extractions
   with methanol gave comparable fatty acid (FA) w/w% from dried
   microalgae. The highest extraction yield and lowest energy consumption
   was found to occur under MW irradiation, especially at high temperatures
   and under pressure. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the advantages of
   US- and MW-assisted lipid extraction from microalgae, both in terms of
   efficiency and operational costs.

AB In the context of climate change and the increase of the energy demand,
   there is a need for carbon sequestration methods and sustainable fuels.
   This can be done by cultivation of microalgae, an unicellular
   microscopic algae that converts carbon dioxide into high-value
   bioproducts and energy. Moreover, microalgae can be used to assess the
   health of ecosystems such as lakes. Here we review microalgae for
   biofuel, for wastewater treatment and as bioindicators. We discuss the
   impact of processes based on microalgae using life cycle assessment. We
   present co-cultivation of microalgae with other microbes, and we compare
   conventional processes with processes integrating auto-flocculation, in
   situ transesterification and excretion.

AB Microalgae is considered as sustainable and viable feedstock for biofuel
   production due to its significant advantages over terrestrial plants.
   Algal biofuels have received significant attention among researchers and
   energy experts owing to an upsurge in global energy issues emanating
   from depletion in fossil fuel reserves increasing greenhouse gases
   emission conflict among agricultural crops, traditional biomass
   feedstock, and potential futuristic energy security. Further, the
   exploration of value-added microalgae as sustainable and viable
   feedstock for the production of variety of biofuels such as biogas,
   bio-hydrogen, bioethanol, and biodiesel are addressed. Moreover, the
   assessment of life-cycle, energy balance, and environmental impacts of
   biofuel production from microalgae are briefly discussed. The present
   study focused on recent advancements in synthetic biology, metabolic
   engineering tools, algal bio refinery, and the optimization of algae
   growth conditions. This paper also elucidates the function of microalgae
   as bio refineries, the conditions of algae-based cultures, and other
   operational factors that must be adjusted to produce biofuels that are
   price-competitive with fossil fuels.

AB There has been increasing attention in recent years on the use of
   photobioreactors for various biotechnological applications, especially
   for the cultivation of microalgae. Photobioreactors-based production of
   photosynthetic microorganisms furnish several advantages as minimising
   toxicity and providing improved conditions. However, the designing and
   scaling-up of photobioreactors (PBRs) remain a challenge. Due to huge
   capital investment and operating cost, there is a deficiency of suitable
   PBRs for development of photosynthetic microorganisms on large-scale. It
   is, therefore, highly desirable to understand the current
   state-of-the-art PBRs, their advantages and limitations so as to
   classify different PBRs as per their most suited applications. This
   review provides a holistic overview of the discreet features of diverse
   PBR designs and their purpose in microalgae growth and biohydrogen
   production and also summarizes the recent development in use of hybrid
   PBRs to increase their working efficiency and overall economics of their
   operation for the production of value-added products.

AB The application of pesticides reduces the loss of crops while
   simultaneously increasing crop productivity. However, the frequent use
   of pesticides can cause serious environmental problems due to their high
   accumulative and persistent nature. Recently, microalgae technology has
   received considerable success in the efficient treatment of pesticides
   pollution. In this review, the metabolic mechanisms responsible for the
   removal of pesticides are summarized based on previous studies.
   Different methods used to enhance the ability of microalgae to remove
   pesticides are critically evaluated. The recycling of microalgae biomass
   after wastewater treatment for biochar preparation and biodiesel
   production using the biorefinery approach is also introduced.
   Furthermore, we present potential future research directions to
   highlight the prospects of microalgae research in the removal of
   pesticides along with the production of value-added products.

   unsustainable throughout the world, and this is due to, amongst others,
   the rapid declining of fossil fuel reserves and the emission of
   significant quantities of greenhouse gases associated with their
   production and combustion. This has resulted in escalating interest in
   research activities aiming to develop alternative and somewhat carbon
   neutral energy sources. Algal biofuels, so called third generation
   biofuels, appear to be promising in delivering sustainable and
   complementary energy platforms essential to formulate a major component
   of the renewable and sustainable energy mix for the future. Algal
   biomass can be converted into various portfolios of biofuel products,
   such as bio-hydrogen, biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas, via two
   different pathways: biochemical and thermochemical pathways.
   Thermochemical conversion is considered as a viable method to overcome
   the existing problems related with biochemical conversion such as
   lengthy reaction time, low conversion efficiency by microbes and
   enzymes, and high production costs. This paper discusses process
   technologies for microalgae-to-biofuel production systems, focusing on
   thermochemical conversion technologies such as gasification, pyrolysis,
   and liquefaction. The benefits of exploiting upstream microalgal biomass
   development for bioremediation such as carbon dioxide mitigation and
   wastewater treatment are also discussed.

AB Advanced biofuels, such as those obtained from microalgae, are widely
   accepted as better choices for achieving goals of incorporating
   renewables and non-food fuel sources into the transportation sector, and
   for overcoming land use issues due to biofuel crops. Main challenges are
   currently the feasibility of large-scale commercialization of microalgae
   biofuels, since there are still some technical problems to overcome
   (e.g. the high energy consumption associated with biomass processing)
   and the majority of economic and financial analyses are based on
   pilot-scale projects. Therefore, this article presents the results of a
   Delphi study aiming to identify the main obstacles and most critical
   issues affecting the potential of large-scale commercialization of
   microalgae biodiesel and its incorporation into the fuel market.
   According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first Delphi study with
   this objective. The respondents are worldwide market specialists in the
   survey themes that ranged from biofuels economics to their environmental
   sustainability. One of the key findings is that most of the experts
   believe that production of microalgae biofuels will achieve its full
   commercial scale until 2020, and that from 2021 till 2030 it could
   represent from 1% to 5% of the worldwide fuel consumption. The study
   results also showed that environmental issues are where expert opinion
   differs more.

AB The Brazilian sugarcane mills already provide significant amounts of
   renewable products (ethanol and bioelectricity) through self-sufficient
   bagasse cogeneration. Gaseous outputs of the sector can provide streams
   rich in biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), suitable for the autotrophic
   cultivation of microalgae and aim, hereinafter, their conversion into
   biodiesel. This work modeled the integration of an ethanol plant with a
   cogeneration system, covering the enzymatic hydrolysis of bagasse and
   the production of microalgae biodiesel. A standard ethanol plant
   yielding 96 L ethanol/t cane may produce an additional 7.5-30 L
   microalgae biodiesel/t cane but at the expense of its energy
   self-sufficiency; the biorefinery must recur to fossil resources unless
   other biomass (besides bagasse) and coproducts by the plant's
   neighborhood can be exploited. The process simulation is conducted in
   nine cases derived from a central composite design with two factors -
   the fraction of bagasse destined for the hydrolysis system (x1) and the
   fraction of ethanol sent to produce anhydrous ethanol (x2) - and three
   levels for each factor (0, 50, 100%). Energy ratios between
   representative outputs and inputs - Net energy ratio (NER) and Fossil
   energy ratio (FER) -, direct CO2 emission, and exergy efficiencies were
   calculated as representative responses to evaluate the plant's technical
   and environmental efficiencies. Statistical tools (t-Student test,
   ANOVA, and R2) showed that the constructed models were robust and that
   the responses varied significantly with x1, while x2 produced mild or
   negligible effects. The highest achievable NER and FER were 0.83 and
   2.09, respectively. The whole system resulted in a FER equal to 1 when
   bagasse usage is split in half between the hydrolysis and cogeneration
   systems. This result guarantees that the energy related to the useful
   products is higher than the requirements of fossil energy inputs, within
   an acceptable range. The optimum CO2 emission and exergy efficiency were
   found when 6-8% of the bagasse is hydrolyzed, which is also a range
   covering attractive energy ratios. The proposed integration benefits the
   sector, but resorting to renewable sources to supply energy deficits,
   developing the technological exploitation over wasted coproducts, and
   studying heat and mass integration of processes are highly recommended
   to enhance the global-system performance.

AB Human urine is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, and the presence of
   these elements in wastewater significantly disrupts the biogeochemical
   cycle. Meanwhile, green algal biomass cultivation is unfeasible without
   these nutrients. Hence, the present study integrates wastewater
   treatment and algae cultivation to extract biodiesel and improve its
   performance through fuel modification.Chlorella vulgarisalgae was
   cultivated in different dilution ratios of water and urine, and the
   nutrient removal rate was analyzed.Chlorella vulgarisalgae biodiesel
   (CAB) was derived through Bligh and Dyer's method followed by
   transesterification, and its functional and elemental groups were
   analyzed. The various volume concentrations of CAB were blended with
   regular diesel fuel (RDF), and 10% water was added to a 30% CAB blended
   RDF to evaluate the combustion performance and environmental impacts.
   The results of the experiments demonstrated that the algae cultivation
   effectively removed the wastewater nutrients. The functional and
   elemental groups of CAB are identical to those of RDF. The engine
   characteristics of test fuels report that the CAB-blend RDF fuel
   mixtures generate low carbon footprints, whereas negative impacts have
   been drawn for performance metrics and oxides of nitrogen emissions. The
   water-emulsified fuel outweighed the unfavorable effects and promoted
   more efficient and cleaner combustion.

AB Currently the production of liquid biofuels relies on plant biomass,
   which in turn depends on the photosynthetic conversion of light and CO2
   into chemical energy. As a consequence, the process is renewable on a
   far shorter time-scale than its fossil counterpart, thus rendering a
   potential to reduce the environmental impact of the transportation
   sector. However, the global economy is not intensively pursuing this
   route, as current generation biofuel production does not meet two key
   criteria: (1) economic feasibility and (2) long-term sustainability.
   Herein, we argue that microalgal systems are valuable alternatives to
   consider, although it is currently technologically immature and
   therefore not possible to reach criterion 1, nor evaluate criterion 2.
   In this review we discuss the major limiting factors for this technology
   and highlight how further research efforts could be deployed to
   concretize an industrial reality.

AB Microalgae biomass is a versatile feedstock with a variable composition
   that can be submitted to several conversion routes. Considering the
   increasing energy demand and the context of third-generation biofuels,
   algae can fulfill the increasing global demand for energy with the
   additional benefit of environmental impact mitigation. While biodiesel
   and biogas are widely consolidated and reviewed, emerging algal-based
   biofuels such as biohydrogen, biokerosene, and biomethane are
   cutting-edge technologies in earlier stages of development. In this
   context, the present study covers their theoretical and practical
   conversion technologies, environmental hotspots, and cost-effectiveness.
   Scaling-up considerations are also addressed, mainly through Life Cycle
   Assessment results and interpretation. Discussions on the current
   literature for each biofuel directs researchers towards challenges such
   as optimized pretreatment methods for biohydrogen and optimized catalyst
   for biokerosene, besides encouraging pilot and industrial scale studies
   for all biofuels. While presenting studies for larger scales, biomethane
   still needs continuous operation results to consolidate the technology
   further. Additionally, environmental improvements on all three routes
   are discussed in light of life-cycle models, highlighting the ample
   research opportunities on wastewater-grown microalgae biomass.

AB In the last few decades, the energy crisis has been one of the main
   concerns related to the lack of long-term petroleum-based reserves as
   primary energy resources. Biodiesel emerged as a promising alternative.
   Nowadays, it is produced from edible vegetable oil, thereby causing
   commodity prices and food security disruption. In this case, microalgae
   serve as a sustainable and renewable feedstock for their fast growth,
   high lipid content, and CO2 absorbing agent. Five processes are applied
   on the production of microalgae-based biodiesel, namely cultivation,
   harvesting, extraction, conversion, and refinement. There is currently
   limited study on technology selection on industrial-scale technology for
   oil extraction from Chlorella spp. of microalgae. Therefore, this study
   aims to review and select the most suitable technology using simple
   multi-attribute rating technique extended to ranking - multi-criteria
   decision analysis (SMARTER-MCDA). Preliminary studies showed that
   conventional organic solvent extraction (COE), ultrasound-assisted
   extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), electric pulse
   extraction (EPE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), and hydrothermal
   liquefaction (HTL) were the most promising technologies. These
   technologies required a series of evaluations using SMARTER-MCDA with
   several criteria, including easy scalability, extraction productivity,
   energy input, additional compound, and environmental impact. The result
   ranking showed that MAE technology was selected as the most suitable
   technology for oil extraction from Chlorella spp.

AB A life-cycle assessment was performed to evaluate the energy conversion
   characteristics and environmental impacts of industrial-scaled
   biohythane (i.e., biohydrogen and biomethane) production via two-stage
   fermentation from microalgae and food waste. The results showed that for
   the entire system, the ratio of net energy input to net energy output
   was 0.24. Biomass pretreatment and microalgae cultivation were the
   dominant energy consumption processes, corresponding to a consumption of
   53.8% and 16.6% of total energy input, respectively. The net greenhouse
   gas emissions per upgraded biohythane for the entire system were 124 g
   CO2-eq MJ-1, whereas the absorption of carbon sources by microalgae
   photosynthesis corresponded to 49 g CO2-eq MJ-1. The dominant emissions
   were generated by electricity production (41.6%), CO2 release in
   pressurized water (27.8%), and energy recovery (19.8%). According to the
   nutrient balance analysis, 55.3% of nutrients in the liquid fermentation
   effluents, including carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus sources, were
   recycled to maintain the microalgae growth conditions. Additionally, the
   uncertainties caused by changes in the key parameters and the lack of
   critical processes were quantitatively analyzed.

AB The aviation sector relies on petroleum jet fuel because it is the most
   efficient energy carrier. Due to environmental and economic concerns a
   strong demand for alternative fuels is emerging. There is a need for
   diversification of energy sources from natural resources. These
   resources must be environmentally friendly and costs effective.
   Environmental impacts of fossil fuels on global warming and climate
   change are being a major concern today. Furthermore, the fluctuations of
   oil prices and need for sustainable fuel supply are the strong drivers
   for the economies of fuel users. In the aviation sector, Jet fuel from
   microalgae is one of the alternatives receiving considerable attention;
   it offers the potential to diversify energy sources. Microalgae species
   can produce lipids; they do not require high use of land, do not need
   freshwater, can grow in marine water or wastewater, grow faster in very
   short period of time, the produced oil is not a threat to food security.
   Similarly, the effect of climate change and global warming due to the
   generation of greenhouse gases (GHG) from petroleum jet fuel can be
   considerably reduced due to low carbon footprint generated by algae
   based fuels. Therefore, algae based aviation fuels can be considered as
   an alternative to produce an efficient fuel compared to conventional
   fuels. Conversely, the key challenge is: many algae species have lower
   lipid content. Harvesting and drying processes are costly as well as
   upstream processes to convert microalgae oil into Jet fuel. Although
   algae biofuels are still small players in the aviation industry, there
   is a potential for the future. This review analyses some routes to be
   explored or already explored, their strengths and weaknesses, the
   current trends and possible conceptual approaches to get aviation fuel
   from microalgae oil.

AB In order to ease one of the main challenges of biomass production in
   wastewater, the harvest stage, this study proposes as main innovations:
   the comparison of technical and environmental performance of different
   methods of harvesting biomass which have not been addressed in the
   literature and the projection of an optimal environmental scenario for
   biomass harvesting. For this, three harvesting methods were evaluated
   and compared, namely the gravitational sedimentation (GS) via settling
   tank, coagulation with tannin followed by gravitational sedimentation
   (TC/GS), and a biofilm reactor operated in parallel with a settling tank
   (BR/GS). TC/GS required less time to concentrate the biomass (121.13
   g/day); however, the biomass had a higher moisture content (99.02%),
   which may compromise its direct application for production of most
   bioproducts and bioenergy, only a dewatering step is recommended. The
   harvesting methods interfered in biomass characterisation, mainly in
   carbohydrate content, which was higher in biomass concentrated over time
   (28-37%) than biomass concentrated in a single day by coagulation
   (13.8%). The results of the life cycle assessment revealed that in
   scenarios which included TC/GS methods and the BR/GS presented less
   environmental impact in relation to only GS. Additionally, the
   combination of these two methods comprises the best scenario and
   promises to optimise the harvest of biomass grown in wastewater.

AB Association of microalgae culture and anaerobic digestion seems a
   promising technology for sustainable algal biomass and biogas
   production. The use of digestates for sustaining the growth of
   microalgae reduces the costs and the environmental impacts associated
   with the substantial algal nutrient requirements. A natural marine
   algae-bacteria consortium was selected by growing on a medium containing
   macro nutrients (ammonia, phosphate and acetate) specific of a
   digestate, and was submitted to a factorial experimental design with
   different levels of temperature, light and pH. The microalgal consortium
   reached a maximum C conversion efficiency (i.e. ratio between carbon
   content produced and carbon supplied through light photosynthetic C
   conversion and acetate) of 3.6%. The presence of bacteria increased this
   maximum C conversion efficiency up to 6.3%. The associated bacterial
   community was considered beneficial to the total biomass production by
   recycling the carbon lost during photosynthesis and assimilating organic
   by-products from anaerobic digestion.

AB The use of algae as a feedstock for biodiesel production is a rapidly
   growing industry, in the United States and globally. A life cycle
   assessment (LCA) is presented that compares various methods, either
   proposed or under development, for algal biodiesel to inform the most
   promising pathways for sustainable full-scale production. For this
   analysis, the system is divided into five distinct process steps: (1)
   microalgae cultivation, (2) harvesting and/or dewatering, (3) lipid
   extraction, (4) conversion (transesterification) into biodiesel, and (5)
   byproduct management. A number of technology options are considered for
   each process step and various technology combinations are assessed for
   their life cycle environmental impacts. The optimal option for each
   process step is selected yielding a best case scenario, comprised of a
   flat panel enclosed photobioreactor and direct transesterification of
   algal cells with supercritical methanol. For a functional unit of 10 GJ
   biodiesel, the best case production system yields a cumulative energy
   demand savings of more than 65 GJ, reduces water consumption by 585
   m3and decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 86% compared to a base case
   scenario typical of early industrial practices, highlighting the
   importance of technological innovation in algae processing and providing
   guidance on promising production pathways.

AB In spite of the increasing interest received by microalgae as potential
   alternatives for biofuel production, the technology is still not
   industrially viable. The utilization of digestate as carbon and
   nutrients source can enhance microalgal growth reducing costs and
   environmental impacts. This work assesses microalgal growth utilizing
   the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate effluent as substrate. The
   effect of inoculum/substrate ratio on microalgal growth was studied in a
   laboratory batch experiment conduced in 0.5 L flasks. Results suggested
   that digestate may be an effective substrate for microalgal growth
   promoting biomass production up to 2.6 gTSS/L. Microalgal growth rate
   was negatively affected by a self-shading phenomenon, while biomass
   production was positively correlated with the inoculum and substrate
   concentrations. Thus, the increasing of both digestate and microalgal
   initial concentration may reduce the initial growth rate ( from 0.9 to
   0.04 d-1) but significantly enhances biomass production (from 0.1 to 2.6
   gTSS/L).

AB The physico-chemical characteristics of two microalgae species
   (Scenedesmus spandNannochloropsis gaditana) and their extracted oils
   have been investigated. Microalgae oils had high calorific value, low
   ash content, high volatile content and low moisture. A comparison of the
   pyrolysis and combustion performance of microalgae and oils samples was
   carried out by performing simultaneous TGA (thermogravimetric analysis)
   and DSC (differential scanning calorimeter) coupled with mass
   spectrometry (MS). The thermochemical behavior of microalgae samples was
   a function of their biochemical composition (proteins, carbohydrates and
   lipids) and inorganic content (ash content). Thermal treatment of
   microalgae oils released lesser NOxand SOxemissions than those of the
   parent microalgae. Finally, the economic viability and environmental
   sustainability of pyrolysis and combustion technologies of microalgae
   and their oils was evaluated by means of life cycle assessment
   methodology. Four different scenarios were analyzed and compared in
   order to provide useful information from the industrial point of view.
   CO and CO2were the main gases produced during the pyrolysis and
   combustion processes. Materials and energy requirements of the processes
   involved were calculated by process simulation. Microalgae oils were the
   best option in terms of energetic performance. Selling price of
   microalgae biomass and plant capacity are critical variables to be
   considered for establishing the financial feasibility of the
   thermochemical process.

U1 2
U2 649
AB Production of algal crude oil has been achieved in various pilot scale
   facilities, but whether algal fuels can be produced in sufficient
   quantity to meaningfully displace petroleum fuels, has been largely
   overlooked. Limitations to commercialization of algal fuels need to be
   understood and addressed for any future commercialization. This review
   identifies the major constraints to commercialization of transport fuels
   from microalgae. Algae derived fuels are expensive compared to petroleum
   derived fuels, but this could change. Unfortunately, improved economics
   of production are not sufficient for an environmentally sustainable
   production, or its large scale feasibility. A low-cost point supply of
   concentrated carbon dioxide colocated with the other essential resources
   is necessary for producing algal fuels. An insufficiency of concentrated
   carbon dioxide is actually a major impediment to any substantial
   production of algal fuels. Sustainability of production requires the
   development of an ability to almost fully recycle the phosphorous and
   nitrogen nutrients that are necessary for algae culture. Development of
   a nitrogen biofixation ability to support production of algal fuels
   ought to be an important long term objective. At sufficiently large
   scale, a limited supply of freshwater will pose a significant limitation
   to production even if marine algae are used. Processes for recovering
   energy from the algal biomass left after the extraction of oil, are
   required for achieving a net positive energy balance in the algal fuel
   oil. The near term outlook for widespread use of algal fuels appears
   bleak, but fuels for niche applications such as in aviation may be
   likely in the medium term. Genetic and metabolic engineering of
   microalgae to boost production of fuel oil and ease its recovery, are
   essential for commercialization of algal fuels. Algae will need to be
   genetically modified for improved photosynthetic efficiency in the long
   term.

AB Biofuels have received much attention recently owing to energy
   consumption and environmental concerns. Despite many of the technologies
   being technically feasible, the processes are often too costly to be
   commercially viable. The major stumbling block to full-scale production
   of algal biofuels is the cost of upstream and downstream processes and
   environmental impacts such as water footprint and indirect greenhouse
   gas emissions from chemical nutrient production. The technoeconomics of
   biofuels production from microalgae is currently unfeasible due to the
   cost of inputs and productivities achieved. The use of a biorefinery
   approach sees the production costs reduced greatly due to utilization of
   waste streams for cultivation and the generation of several potential
   energy sources and value-added products while offering environmental
   protection. The use of wastewater as a production media, coupled with
   CO2sequestration from flue gas greatly reduces the microalgal
   cultivation costs. Conversion of residual biomass and by-products, such
   as glycerol, for fuel production using an integrated approach
   potentially holds the key to near future commercial implementation of
   biofuels production.

AB BACKGROUND: The increasing cost of fossil fuels as well as the
   escalating social and industrial awareness of the environmental impacts
   associated with the use of fossil fuels has created the need for more
   sustainable fuel options. Bioethanol, produced from renewable biomass
   such as sugar and starch materials, is believed to be one of these
   options, and it is currently being harnessed extensively. However, the
   utilization of sugar and starch materials as feedstocks for bioethanol
   production creates a major competition with the food market in terms of
   land for cultivation, and this makes bioethanol from these sources
   economically less attractive. RESULT: This study explores the
   suitability of microalgae (Chlorococum sp.) as a substrate for
   bioethanol production via yeast (Saccharomyces bayanus) under different
   fermentation conditions. Results show a maximum ethanol concentration of
   3.83 g L-1 obtained from 10 g L-1 of lipid-extracted microalgae debris.
   CONCLUSION: This productivity level (38% w/w), which is in keeping with
   that of current production systems endorses microalgae as a promising
   substrate for bioethanol production.

AB Resource recovery from agro-industrial wastes in the sugar-ethanol
   industry is a strategy under wide development. Besides promoting
   sustainability of the biorefinery plant and mitigating its negative
   environmental impacts, this strategy may also economically benefit the
   agro-industry by commercializing recovered added-value resources. In
   this regard, the sector commonly exploits by-products such as biofuels
   and biomaterials. This study proposes to build a critical review of a
   hypothetical integrated biogas plant combined with vinasse treatment and
   microalgae cultivation annexed within a sugar-ethanol mill. It addresses
   an innovative approach by proposing a sustainability-oriented plant (in
   terms of energy and resources) that combines different processes
   individually discussed in the literature. This strategy contributes to
   maintaining a closed-loop in the sugar-ethanol industrial plant. The
   primary data on algal cultivation in a mixotrophic medium (pretreated
   vinasse) and biogas generation from the anaerobic co-digestion of
   vinasse and algal biomass are listed. It then focuses on implementing
   resource recovery techniques aiming at achieving biorefinery
   sustainability, viz., valorizing nutrients from the biosolids as
   biofertilizers and disposing of treated vinasse for fertigation of
   sugarcane crops. In addition, biogas purification may generate
   biomethane (as a source of heat and electrical energy) and promote
   supplementary carbon for microalgae cultivation. Lastly, the proposed
   plant's viability is demonstrated by calculating the system's energy
   balance and net energy ratio (NER), whose results are +14.49
   MJ.m-3vinasseand 2.0, respectively.

AB The total combined weight of biological material on planet Earth has
   been estimated in one source at about 75 * 109 t. Of this: crops
   comprise 2 * 109 t (2.7%) as well as microbes, fungi, algae and similar
   types of microorganisms are estimated to comprise over 50% of the total
   amount. Microalgae is outstanding among all the types of biomass sources
   in its ability to respond to the challenges of the future in terms of
   availability, high growth and production rates, yield per unit area, not
   competing for arable land, being most suitable optimal sources for both
   liquid and gaseous biofuels and valuable co-products within
   biorefineries. It is logical that the increased ability to occupy new
   niches in the energy sector is determined by uptake of the new forms of
   biomass exploitation coupled with environmental impact reduction. This
   could explain the worldwide interest in exploiting algal biomass as an
   ideal attribute for photosynthetic capture of anthropogenic carbon that
   reached a record high of  10 Pg C yr-1 in 2014. In this review, we
   outline microalgae's potential to capture carbon in coal-fired power
   plant, discuss the advantages of photosynthetic organisms as a source
   for biodiesel and solid biofuel production, discuss the process
   engineering, different synergies and legislative factors needed to make
   the process efficient and economically viable. Before commercial-scale
   installations become feasible, however, numerous points still have to be
   resolved. In order to identify potentials and obtain recommendations for
   action, co-authors have studied in detail various options for
   climate-beneficial recycling and trapping CO2 in the algae factories of
   the future that potentially could be built in the European humid
   continental climate countries.

AB The increasing global population has led to a significant accumulation
   of food waste. It is important to focus on reducing food waste instead
   of disposal methods like landfilling and incineration, which have severe
   environmental impacts. Upcycling food waste has emerged as an effective
   strategy for repurposing discarded food into higher-value products.
   However, concerns about food safety and public acceptance of products
   directly produced from food waste persist. Consequently, there is
   growing interest in utilizing food waste rich in moisture and
   biodegradable organic compounds as a potential medium for cultivating
   microalgae. This review article examines the utilization of food waste
   as a culture medium for microalgae cultivation and the methods for
   treating food waste to enhance its nutrient content. Additionally, it
   discusses the influence of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and
   phosphorus on microalgae growth and external factors such as pH and
   light intensity. The article also addresses the innovation of the food
   supply chain from environmental, social, and economic perspective, along
   with food safety and public acceptability concerns. Furthermore, it
   explores the legislative issues surrounding products derived from food
   waste and the end use of microalgae biomass produced from food waste.
   Overall, this review provides insight into the potential of microalgae
   cultivation using food waste, serving as a platform towards the
   realization of a circular bioeconomy.

AB This study presents a life cycle greenhouse gas and energy assessment
   for two algal biofuel production pathways: biodiesel produced through
   lipid extraction (LE) and renewable diesel produced through hydrothermal
   liquefaction (HTL). The two production pathways generate different
   co-products, which are handled through allocation in life cycle
   assessment-based analyses. The method and assumptions used for
   co-product allocation affect the performance of the analyzed fuels, and
   are thus examined through scenario analysis; five co-product allocation
   strategies are tested for the LE pathway and six are tested for the HTL
   pathway. After allocation, the carbon intensity of renewable diesel
   varies from 36 to 54 gCO2e/MJ, and the primary energy consumption of
   renewable diesel varies from 0.7 to 1.2 MJ/MJ; while the carbon
   intensity of biodiesel ranges, remarkably, from -59 to 125 gCO2e/MJ, and
   the primary energy consumption of biodiesel ranges from 0.1 to 1.7
   MJ/MJ. The optimal algal oil production pathway is determined by
   comparing open-loop and closed-loop systems, considering not only the
   estimated net environmental impacts, but also the confidence or

AB Growth of the hydrogen market has motivated increased study of hydrogen
   production. Understanding how biomass is converted to hydrogen gas can
   help in evaluating opportunities for reducing the environmental impact
   of petroleum-based fuels. Using an atmospheric-pressure microwave plasma
   reactor coupled with species-selective analysis, experiments are
   conducted at microwave power levels of 800, 900 and 1000 W, a reactant
   flow rate of 12 slm, and 1 g of dry Spirulina algae in nitrogen. At the
   absorbed microwave power levels used in this experiment, hydrogen gas
   produced is in the range of 36.75-45.13% volume fraction, 13.42-15.48 mg
   per minute, and 12.37-31.46 mg per gram of Spirulina algae consumed.
   Moreover, the selection of power levels demonstrates that 20.62-52.43%
   hydrogen atom mass content in dry algae is converted to hydrogen gas. In
   general, the effect of reaction temperatures on the gas product
   formation is qualitatively consistent with those produced from other
   biomass materials reported in literature. Overall, these results will
   help to expand our knowledge concerning Spirulina algae and hydrogen
   yield on the basis of microwave-assisted pyrolysis and reaction
   temperatures, which will inform the study and design of hydrogen
   production technologies.

   Scopus database resulted in 1339 research articles from 1990 to November
   2023. Majority of publications (46%) were affiliated to China and India,
   showing their predominance in this field. Keywords related to the center
   of attention included biodiesel, biofuel, biomass and nutrient removal.
   Meanwhile, keyword with recent publication year, indicating the emerging
   research trends, revolved around the cultivation techniques and
   application of the system. Co-culture involving more than one microalgae
   species, bacteria and yeast showed promising results, while addition of
   nanoparticles was also found to be beneficial. Increasing exploration on
   the application of microalgae for treatment of saline wastewater was
   also reported and the carbon fixation mechanism by microalgae has been
   widely investigated to promote less environmental impact. Future
   research on these topics were suggested based on the findings of the
   bibliometric analyses.

AB Introduction: Mixotrophic microalgae systems have great potential for
   bioenergy production and wastewater treatment. Anaerobic -treated
   wastewater supplemented with carbon can improve biomass yield and
   quality, as it presents low carbon content. Alternative carbon sources
   in microalgae cultivation, such as glycerol, are essential for
   minimizing the economic and environmental impacts caused by biomass
   production, and improving the profile of fatty acids. This study aimed
   to increase biomass production and the lipid content with glycerol as
   the carbon source for microalgae cultivation from sanitary
   wastewater.Materials and Methods: The microalgae behavior in the
   wastewater was pilot tested using glycerol supplementation at 7.5, 10.5,
   and 12.5 g L- 1.Results: In all the experiments with sanitary
   wastewater, the microalgae production presentedChlorellasp. as the
   predominant species. The best biomass (3.78  1.12 g L- 1) and lipid
   (35.67  0.80%) yield s were found at 12.5 and 10.5 g L-1of glycerol,
   respectively.Conclusion: The microalgae produced more lipids with
   glycerol supplementation. An attractive profile for biodiesel was found
   regarding the fatty acids in the biomass.

   wastewater using microalgae: a review.
SO Journal of Hazardous Materials
VL 403
PY 2021
U1 86
U2 1088
AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a group of
   emerging micro-pollutants causing detrimental effects on living
   organisms even at low doses. Previous investigations have confirmed the
   presence of PPCPs in the environment at hazardous levels, mainly due to
   the inefficiency of conventional wastewater treatment plants (CWWTPs).
   Their stable structure induces longer persistence in the environment.
   Microalgae are currently used to bioremediate numerous pollutants of
   different characteristics and properties released from the domestic,
   industrial, agricultural, and farm sectors. CO2 mitigation during
   culture and the use of biomass as feedstock for biodiesel or biofuel
   production are, briefly, other benefits of microalgae-mediated treatment
   over CWWTPs. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent
   literature, an overview of approaches and treatment systems, and
   breakthrough in the field of algal-mediated removal of PPCPs in
   wastewater treatment processes. The mechanisms involved in
   phycoremediation, along with their experimental approaches, have been
   discussed in detail. Factors influencing the removal of PPCPs from
   aqueous media are comprehensively described and assessed. A comparative
   study on microalgal strains is analyzed for a more efficient
   implementation of future processes. The role of microalgae to mitigate
   the most severe environmental impacts of PPCPs and the generation of
   antibiotic-resistant bacteria is discussed. Also, a detailed assessment
   of recent research on potential toxic effects of PPCPs on microalgae was
   conducted. The current review highlights microalgae as a promising and
   sustainable approach to efficiently bio-transform or bio-adsorb PPCPs.

AB Microalgae provide great promise for the production of biofuels as they
   have the highest growth rates of all photosynthetic organisms and have
   demonstrated high levels of desirable products required for biofuel
   production without competing for land or resources from the agriculture
   industry. It has been established that the type of algae chosen to
   cultivate is very important. This can affect which techniques may be
   best to use for harvesting and converting algae to biofuels. It is
   important to consider the lipid content of the algae and its growth rate
   as a high yield shall be needed from the process, but it must also be of
   high quality. The research that has been conducted so far has proven
   very useful, however, there is still much to learn when it comes to the
   best techniques to use for the production of biofuels. Any process
   utilizing microalgae needs to be cost-effective to be commercially
   viable and be able to fit into the current fuel demand without altering
   distribution or storage processes. In order to achieve a positive energy
   balance which will be important when considering cost-effective
   processes, a highly optimized production system is required. In recent
   scientific discussions, many of the environmental impacts and
   cost-performance points raised produce both challenges and opportunities
   that would require further research and the potential integration of
   other processes. Once a gold standard has been established for the
   cultivation of algal biomass and lipid extraction methods,
   commercialization of algal biofuel production will soon follow.

AB Global increases in atmospheric CO2 and climate change are drawing
   considerable attention to identify sources of energy with lower
   environmental impact than those currently in use. Biodiesel production
   from microalgae lipids can, in the future, occupy a prominent place in
   energy generation because it represents a sustainable alternative to
   petroleum-based fuels. Several species of microalgae produce large
   amounts of lipids per biomass unit. Triacylglycerol is the fatty acid
   used for biodiesel production and the main source of energy reserves in
   microalgae. The current literature indicates that nutrient limitations
   can lead to triacylglycerol accumulation in different species of
   microalgae. Further efforts in microalgae screening for biodiesel
   production are needed to discover a native microalgae that will be
   feasible for biodiesel production in terms of biomass productivity and
   oil. This revision focuses in the biotechnological potential and
   viability of biodiesel production from microalgae. Brazil is located in
   a tropical region with high light rates and adequate average
   temperatures for the growth of microalgae. The wide availability of
   bodies of water and land will allow the country to produce renewable
   energy from microalgae.

AB Thin-layer cascades (TLCs) enable algae cultivation at high cell
   densities, thus increasing biomass yields and facilitating the harvest
   process. This makes them a promising technology for industrial-scale
   algal fuel production. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), we calculate
   the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of aviation fuel produced using algal
   biomass from TLCs. We find that the impact (81 g CO2e per MJ) is lower
   than that of fuel from algal biomass cultivated in open race way ponds
   (94 g CO2e). However, neither of the two cultivation systems achieve
   sufficient GHG savings for compliance with the Renewable Energy
   Directive II. Seawater desalination in particular dominates the TLC
   impact, indicating a trade-off between carbon and water footprint. In
   both cultivation systems, the mixing power and fertilizer consumption
   present further significant impacts. There is uncertainty in the
   correlation between mixing power and algal oil yield, which should be
   investigated by future experimental studies.

AB Microalgae are highly efficient photosynthesis cell factories for CO2
   capture, biofuel productions and wastewater treatment. Phenol is a
   typical environmental contaminant. Microalgae normally have a low
   tolerance for, and a low degradation rate to, high concentration of
   phenol. Adaptive laboratory evolution was performed for phenolic
   wastewater treatment by Chlorella sp. The resulting strain was obtained
   after 31 cycles (about 95 d) under 500 mg/L phenol as environmental
   stress. It could grow under 500 mg/L and 700 mg/L phenol without
   significant inhibition. The maximal biomass concentrations of the
   resulting strain at day 8 were 3.40 g/L under 500 mg/L phenol and 2.70
   g/L under 700 mg/L phenol, respectively. They were more than two times
   of those of the original strain. In addition, 500 mg/L phenol was fully
   removed by the resulting strain in 7 d when the initial cell density was
   0.6 g/L.

AB Microalgae are a promising source of starch with the potential to reduce
   land and water footprints as compared to terrestrial plants. However, so
   far, there are no specific downstream processes to recover microalgal
   starch. In this work, the development of a lab-scale biorefinery to
   produce microalgal starch is described. Guidelines are provided on how
   to set up microalgae cultivation, attaining until 37% starch content and
   0.48 g L-1 d-1 starch productivity in 500 mL lab-scale photobioreactors.
   Cell lysis by ultrasonication in water and ethanol was studied,
   obtaining better disruption rates at a lower temperature (30°C) in
   water. The refinery of the lysate was studied by comparing the
   conventional Percoll protocol with more potentially scalable methods:
   aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) and ethanol extraction. Ethanol
   allowed attainment of the best results, separating quantitatively
   lipids, with reduced pigment degradation, by ensuring higher starch
   recovery (91%) and starch content (57%) in the refined pellet. Finally,
   refined starch was used to produce a plastic film that showed mechanical
   properties comparable to those obtained by using corn starch. This study
   provides preliminary evidence that microalgal starch could replace
   conventional starch sources in the biobased industry, possibly with
   reduced environmental impacts.

AB The microalgae have a great potential as the fourth generation biofuel
   feedstock to deal with energy crisis, but the cost of production and
   biomass harvest are the major hurdles in terms of large scale production
   and applications. Using filamentous fungi to culture targeted alga for
   biomass accumulation and eventually harvesting is a sustainable way to
   mitigate environmental impacts. Microalgal co-culture method could be an
   alternative to overcome limitations and increase biomass yield and lipid
   accumulation. It was found to be the high feasibility for the production
   of biofuels from fungi and microalgae using wastewater. This article
   aimed to state the synergistic approaches, their culture protocols,
   harvesting procedure and their potential biotechnological applications.
   Additionally, algal-fungal consortia could digest cellulosic biomass,
   potentially reducing operating costs as part of industrial need. As a
   result of co-cultivation, biofuel production could be economically
   feasible owing to its excellent ability to treat wastewater and be
   eco-friendly. The implications of the innovative co-cultivation
   technology have demonstrated the potential for further development based
   on the policies that have been supported and implemented.

AB Microalgal biofuels and biomass have ecofriendly advantages as
   feedstocks. Improved understanding and utilization of microalgae require
   large-scale analysis of the morphological and metabolic heterogeneity
   within populations. Here, withEuglena gracilisas a model microalgal
   species, we evaluate how fluorescence- and
   brightfield-derived-image-based descriptors vary during environmental
   stress at the single-cell level. This is achieved with a new
   multiparameter fluorescence-imaging cytometric technique that allows the
   assaying of thousands of cells per experiment. We track morphological
   changes, including the intensity and distribution of intracellular lipid
   droplets, and pigment autofluorescence. The combined
   fluorescence-morphological analysis identifies new metrics not
   accessible with traditional flow cytometry, including the
   lipid-to-cell-area ratio (LCAR), which shows promise as an indicator of
   oil productivity per biomass. Single-cell metrics of lipid productivity
   were highly correlated (R2>0.90,p<0.005) with bulk oil extraction. Such
   chemomorphological atlases of algal species can help optimize growth
   conditions and selection approaches for large-scale biomass production.

AB Innovative approaches to clean energy development are vital as whole
   world looks for ways to reduce global warming pollution and fuel the
   clean energy future. Driven by population development and
   industrialization, demand for primary energy and food is increasing at
   an unprecedented pace. Fossil fuel consumption cannot be the solution
   for much longer, and existing renewable energy sources are still unable
   to offer scalable, competitive alternatives. Increasing food production
   requires arable land and fresh water but the intensive use of
   fertilizers produced from natural gas returns us again to the energy
   challenge. In the global energy crisis context, Biodiesel has core
   advantages over mineral diesel in that it is renewable, biodegradable,
   clean-burning, non-toxic and carbon neutral with respect to carbon
   dioxide related climate change. Photosynthetic microorganism microalgae
   and cyanobacteria as a potential source of biofuels because of their
   abilities to grow rapidly utilize non-arable land, non-potable water,
   waste streams and do not compete with world agriculture market. It can
   produce large amount of cellular storage lipids in the form of
   triacylglycerols (TAGs) which can be readily converted to biodiesel via
   a simple chemical transesterification reaction with zero emissions of
   both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. In above context present
   review present potential of photosynthetic microorganism as a source of
   biofuel and their impact on agriculture and environment.

AB Due to the increasing global appetite for renewable liquid fuels, the
   need for developing suitable technology to meet this demand is
   imperative. Microalgae are a promising new source of biomass that may
   complement agricultural crops. Production of microalgae has so far been
   limited to high-value applications. In order to realize large-scale
   production of microalgae biomass for low-value applications, New
   low-cost technologies are needed to produce and process microalgae. A
   major challenge lies in the harvesting of the microalgae, which requires
   the separation of a low amount of biomass consisting of small individual
   cells from a large volume of culture medium. Flocculation is seen as a
   promising low-cost harvesting method. Producing the right quality and
   quantity of oil and FAME product will largely determined by
   technoeconomics of the technology. Downstream processing for the
   potential commercial production of microalgae oil not only must consider
   economic costs, but should also consider minimizing environmental
   impacts in order to attain sustainable production processes. This paper
   reviews the cultivation, harvesting and extraction of oil from
   microalgae as a future source for biodiesel production.

AB An energy-input analysis of the life-cycle of microalgal cultivation
   systems was performed to study the oil-rich biomass production from
   fast-growing microalgae, for biodiesel production purposes. We estimated
   and compared the energy demands for the algal biomass cultivation in
   open-ponds (OP) with that required in closed-system photobioreactors
   (PBR) based on the new technologies. We also present the best microalgal
   candidates that show the highest biomass productivity and lipid yield
   indoors (laboratory scale), and discuss their potential to be used for
   full-scale biodiesel production. The results show that the energy
   requirements are highly dependent on the final mass concentration and/or
   using industrial wastes, with PBR cultivation being the largest energy
   consumer. Our offered scenario to minimize energy inputs and to increase
   algal-oil yields considers the most ideal cases, which could be the most
   promising model for energy-efficient biofuel production. Although
   biodiesel production by any of these systems is still not economically
   competitive with fossil fuel, recent suggestions on how to increase the
   efficiency of both systems are discussed, based on our energy-input
   assessment, with a critical evaluation of all stages for large-scale
   production of oil-rich microalgal biomass.

AB Life cycle assessment of biodiesel produced from microalgae showed that
   the pure energy output was negative by the route of biodiesel (FAME), if
   the biodiesel was produced from high moisture content microalgae slurry
   by dry, cell disruption, solvent extraction of lipids, and
   transesterification. Therefore, passive choices are that mathane or
   bioethanol is obtained by anerobic digestion of microalgae slurry or
   their hydrolysate, or microalgae based bio-oils are obtained by fast
   pyrolysis and microwave assisted pyrolysis of dried microalgae biomass,
   or microalgae based bio-oils or syngas by hydrothermal treatment of
   microalgae slurry. Although the high heating value (HHV) of microalgae
   based bio-oils are much higher than lignocellulosic bio-oils, it can
   still not meet the demand of transportation liquid fuel due to its high
   nitrogen content, high oxygen content and instability. Possessing
   superiority of dehydration, oil extraction, protein and polysaccharide
   separation, or even in situ biodiesel production from high moisture
   content microalgae slurry, subcritical water treatment may become the
   prior research field of downstream processing technology for microalgae
   biofuels today. The most challenging research field is to know how to
   extract lipids, separate cytochrome, protein, polysaccharide from high
   moisture content microalgae slurry simultaneously under very mild
   reaction condition of enzymolysis, so that most of the functional
   components of the microalgae will be saved for value added comprehensive
   utilization. Last and key technology that may guide microalgae fuel to
   commercialization is how to manufacture renewable and high quality
   hydrocarbon diesel effectively from microalgae oil or its soap by
   microwave polarization decarboxylation.

AB Gasification of Short Rotation Forestry (SRF) poplar wood chips and
   anaerobic digestion of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris have been
   analyzed as alternative supply chains for the production of biomethane.
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed from the biomass cultivation
   to the upgrading stages. Process simulation of gasification and
   upgrading was carried out, environmental impacts of the entire supply
   chains have been estimated and discussed. The highest CO2 removal has
   been reached by absorption on monoethanolamine. Electricity requirements
   heavily affect the SRF chain, while productions of carbon dioxide and
   fertilizers are the main sources of impact of the microalgae
   cultivation. The recycle of non-absorbed fertilizers, as well as
   integration of microalgae digestion in wastewater plants, are
   recommended. Capture and re-injection of the CO2 lost during the
   upgrading stages would result, simultaneously, in an 8.53% reduction of
   the atmospheric emission, and in a minor demand to promote algal growth.

   systems thinking with a comprehensive worldview as a guiding principle
   to develop the economy, whilst taking cognisance of the need to
   safeguard the environment, and to embrace the socio-cultural diversity
   dimension as an equal component. Any discussion on climate change,
   destruction of eco-system and habitat for wildlife, poverty and
   starvation, and the spread of infectious diseases, must be addressed
   together with the emphasis on the development of cleaner energy, air and
   water, better management of resources and biodiversity, improved
   agro-practices for food production and distribution, and affordable
   health care, as the outcomes and key performance indicators to be
   evaluated. Strict regulation, monitoring and enforcement to minimize
   emission, pollution and wastage must also be put in place.
   ConclusionThis review article focuses on the research and development
   efforts to achieve sustainable bioenergy production, environmental
   remediation, and transformation of agro-materials into value-added
   bioproducts through the integrated algal and oil palm biorefinery.
   Recent development in microalgal research with nanotechnology as
   anti-cancer and antimicrobial agents and for biopharmaceutical
   applications are discussed. The life-cycle analysis in the context of
   palm oil mill processes is evaluated. The way forward from this
   integrated biorefinery concept is to strive for inclusive development
   strategies, and to address the immediate and pressing problems facing

   their high N, P and CO2 removal capacity. Objective: To determine the
   potential of fish processing wastewater from the fishing industry in
   Sancti Spiritus for biogas and microalgae production. Materials and
   Methods: The physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater are taken
   as a starting point and mass balances are performed using indexes from
   the literature to determine the volumes of biogas and the amount of
   biomass harvested from the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. Results and
   Discussion: The analyzed waters represent a potential for obtaining
   biogas and for the development of microalgae cultures as a promising
   alternative to improve process performance, which allows obtaining
   energy and high value-added products. Conclusions: The wastewater from
   the Pescaspir fishing company produces 21.8 m3 of biogas per day and
   0.58 kg/d of dry microalgal biomass, so the proposed treatment system
   allows the generation of renewable energy, the production of biomass,
   obtaining a purified effluent and reducing the environmental impact on
   natural aquatic systems, in addition to other possible technological
   applications.

AB Bioenergy products appear to be practical, effective, and
   environmentally sustainable renewable energy resources which
   simultaneously reduce fuel-associated environmental impacts and increase
   economic value of the products. The use of bioproducts may not always
   have a net positive environmental or economic attributes, therefore, an
   adequate sustainability evaluation tool for the products which
   incorporates life-cycle approach is generally desired. This paper
   presents an informative value analysis which couples concepts of life
   cycle energy efficiency and production cost ratios, for a feasible
   assessment of function value for bioenergy products. Bioenergy products
   that are selected for the value assessment in this study include
   biodiesel, bioethanol and biocharcoal. This study is divided into two
   parts: value factor development along with discussions on the results of
   value analysis for bioenergy products, and, a sensitivity analysis in
   determining influential factors for value factor estimations. The
   results showed that microalgae biodiesel and biochar had the lowest and
   the highest function values, respectively, among assessed bioenergy
   systems. This was mainly due to the significant difference in energy
   input in manufacturing design and production cost. Future improvements
   in bioenergy production can be anticipated for developing bioenergy
   products with high value factors which demonstrate high economic
   viability, environmental performance and social acceptability. This
   analysis can be of interest to bioenergy production planners for
   sustainable product development.

AB Algal biomass is considered as a promising source of alternative fuel
   energy given its high yield per land area and other potential benefits.
   Categorized as an advanced generation biofuel feedstock, microalgae are
   grown in non-conventional ways through different cultivation systems. A
   preference of a cultivation system may vary depending on a given
   scenario and its inherent configuration (strength and weakness). Hence,
   the usage of a specific cultivation system to sustainably produce algal
   biofuels depends on various factors. Thus, a multi-criteria approach
   based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed for evaluating
   alternative cultivation systems for sustainable production of algal
   biofuels. The main criteria considered to evaluate the alternatives
   based on consultation with a panel of expert and from literature are
   environmental impact, energy consumption, economic viability, social
   acceptability, and system robustness. Sub-criteria were identified under
   each main criterion to further qualify the analysis into relevant
   sub-factors in the sustainable production of algal biofuels. Three
   cultivations systems were used as an example to demonstrate the
   developed decision model using qualitative data and quantitative data.
   Probabilistic scenarios were analyzed using stochastic approach via
   Monte Carlo simulation. The results of the stochastic-based AHP showed
   which cultivation system is preferred for conservative (risk-averse) and
   optimistic (risk-inclined) scenarios.

AB The environmental benefits and trade-offs of automotive biofuels are
   well known, but less is known about aviation biofuels. We modeled the
   environmental impacts of three pathways for aviation biofuel in
   Australia (from microalgae, pongamia, and sugarcane molasses) using
   attributional life cycle assessments (LCAs), applying both economic
   allocation and system expansion. Based on economic allocation, sugarcane
   molasses has the better fossil energy ratio FER (1.7 MJ out/MJ in) and
   GHG abatement (73% less than aviation kerosene) of the three, but with
   trade-offs of higher water use and eutrophication potential. Microalgae
   and pongamia have lower FER and GHG abatement (1.0 and 1.1; 53% and
   43%), but mostly avoid eutrophication and reduce water use trade-offs.
   All have similar and relatively low land use intensities. If produced on
   land where existing carbon stocks are not compromised, the sugarcane and
   microalgae pathways would currently meet a 50% GHG abatement
   requirement. Based on system expansion, microalgae and pongamia had
   lower impacts than sugarcane for all categories except energy input,
   highlighting the positive aspects of these next-generation feedstocks.
   The low fossil energy conservation potential of these pathways was found
   to be a drawback, and significant energy efficiencies will be needed
   before they can affect fossil energy conservation. Energy recovery from
   processing residues (base case) was preferable over use as animal feed
   (variant case), and crucial for favorable energy and GHG conservation.
   However this finding is at odds with the economic preferences identified
   in a companion technoeconomic study.

AB The present work evaluates the phenol degradative performance of
   microalgaeChlorella pyrenoidosa. High-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) analysis showed thatC. pyrenoidosadegrades phenol completely up
   to 200 mg/l. It could also metabolize phenol in refinery wastewater.
   Biokinetic parameters obtained are the following: growth kinetics,
   max(media) > max(refinery wastewater),Ks(media) <Ks(refinery
   wastewater),KI(media) >KI(refinery wastewater); degradation
   kinetics,qmax(media) >qmax(refinery wastewater),Ks(media) <Ks(refinery
   wastewater),KI(media) >KI(refinery wastewater). The microalgae could
   cometabolize the alkane components present in refinery wastewater.
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) fingerprinting of biomass indicates
   intercellular phenol uptake and breakdown into its intermediates. Phenol
   was metabolized as an organic carbon source leading to higher specific
   growth rate of biomass. Phenol degradation pathway was elucidated using
   HPLC, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and
   ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) spectrophotometry. It involved both
   ortho- and meta-pathway with prominence of ortho-pathway. SEM analysis
   shows that cell membrane gets wrinkled on phenol exposure. Phenol
   degradation was growth and photo dependent. Infrared analysis shows
   increased intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids opening
   possibility for utilization of spent biomass as biodiesel feedstock. The
   biomass after lipid extraction could be used as protein supplement in
   animal feed owing to enhanced protein content. The phenol remediation
   ability coupled with potential applicability of the spent biomass as
   biofuel feedstock and animal feed makes it a potential candidate for an
   environmentally sustainable process.

AB The production of biomass by microalgae is considered a clean

   cultivation and that generate environmental impacts. This study
   evaluated the influence of temperature and nutrients on lipid contents
   of cultured species of freshwater microalgae, with a view toward using
   these lipids for biodiesel production. Two strains ofMonoraphidium
   contortum, a culture containingChlorella vulgarisandDesmodesmus
   quadricaudaand another strain ofMicrocystis aeruginosawere maintained in
   the laboratory for six days, in five culture media: modified ASM-1
   (control, with high concentrations of phosphate and nitrate;
   phosphorus-deficient; non-limiting phosphate; nitrogen-deficient; and
   non-limiting nitrate). The cultures were then exposed to temperatures of
   13°C, 25°C (control) and 37°C for eight days (n=3). Lipids were
   extracted by the cold-solvent (methanol and chloroform) method. On
   average, the highest total lipid yields were observed when the strains
   were maintained at 13°C and in the non-limiting nitrate medium. The
   lipid percentage varied depending on the concentration of algal biomass.
   This study showed that manipulation of controlling factors can increase
   the lipid concentration, optimizing the total production in order to use
   this raw material for biodiesel.

AB This bibliographic review gives a concise overview of cultivation of
   microalgae for the production of biofuel.Chlamydomonas reinhardtiiis one
   of the best microalgae that can be used for producing biofuel because of
   its simplicity of genome that allows it to be easily manipulated by
   genetic engineering for abundant growth.C. reinhardtiiproduces lipids
   under nitrogen deficient condition, which contains many triacylglycerols
   (TAGs) that influences the metabolism to a great extent and used for
   membrane remodeling. Several genes such as citrate synthase and DGAT2
   involved in this mechanism were manipulated by engineering metabolic
   pathways to maximize lipid production under nitrogen deprived
   conditions. Additionally,C. reinhardtiican be efficiently cultivated and
   grown in closed photobioreactors, flat plate, tubular or vertical column
   with protected CO2rather than open pond systems. In addition,C.
   reinhardtiican be harvested by several methods including Tris-Acetate
   Phosphate Pluronic (TAPP) medium method. Compared to conventional
   diesel, microalgae based biofuel, which is produced by
   trans-esterfication reactions, has a higher pour point temperature but
   similar properties. Contrasting Energy-efficiency ratio (EER) values
   ofC. reinhardtiiwith those of other crops (Jatropha, palm oil and
   sunflower) is a crucial process before commercialization. The
   environmental impacts of microalgae are also beneficial in a way it can
   treat wastewater containing large amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen
   and phosphorus, which are beneficial for algae cultivation and produce
   bio-oil. However, this is a risky proposition as it can cause
   eutrophication and hypoxia in the ponds. Nevertheless, further research
   on bio-fuel production fromC. reinhardtiimust be carried out.

AB The aim of this work was to perform life cycle analyses (LCA) based on
   detailed process mass and energy balances for the production of
   biodiesel from microalgae in order to compare the conventional
   transesterification with in situ transesterification. GaBi software was
   used to perform the LCA. The material balances revealed that a slightly
   lower biodiesel yield was obtained for in situ transesterification
   process (5.06 kg/day) when compared to the conventional one (5.5
   kg/day). GaBi results showed that the global warming potential (GWP) of
   the conventional transesterification process was higher than in situ
   transesterification by 140 kg CO2equivalent (per tonne of biodiesel
   produced). No substantial difference was noted however, for
   acidification (4.15 vs. 4.34 kg SO2equivalent), eutrophication (0.641 to
   0.666 kg PO4-equivalent) and human toxicity potential (72.3 vs. 77 kg
   dichlorobenzene equivalent) between the two processes per kg of
   biodiesel produced. The results of the LCA analysis also show that
   electricity production was the major contributor for all the
   environmental impacts. When both the global warming potential and
   biodiesel yield were taken into account, it could be concluded that
   biodiesel production via in situ transesterification was a better
   option.

AB Many countries have been experienced an increase in protein consumption
   due to the population growth and adoption of protein-rich dietaries.
   Unfortunately, conventional-based protein agroindustry is associated
   with environmental impacts that might aggravate as the humankind
   increase. Thus, it is important to screen for novel protein sources that
   are environmentally friendly. Microalgae farming is a promising
   alternative to couple the anthropic emissions with the production of
   food and feed. Some microalgae show protein contents two times higher
   than conventional protein sources. The use of whole microalgae biomass
   as a protein source in food and feed is simple and well-established.
   Conversely, the production of microalgae protein supplements and
   isolates requires the development of feasible and robust processes able
   to fractionate the microalgae biomass in different value-added products.
   Since most of the proteins are inside the microalgae cells, several
   techniques of disruption have been proposed to increase the efficiency
   to extract them. After the disruption of the microalgae cells, the
   proteins can be extracted, concentrated, isolated or purified allowing
   the development of different products. This critical review addresses
   the current state of the production of microalgae proteins for
   multifarious applications, and possibilities to concatenate the
   production of proteins and advanced biofuels.

AB The bioeconomy is a new and essential paradigm for reducing our
   dependence on natural resources and responding to the environmental
   threats that the Earth is currently facing. In this regard, microalgae
   offer almost unlimited possibilities for developing a modern bioeconomy
   given their metabolic flexibility and high biomass output rates, even
   when produced under harsh conditions, such as when treating wastewaters
   or using flue gases. In this article, the microalgal contribution to
   important economic activities such as the production of food and feed,
   cosmetics and health-related compounds is reviewed. Moreover, potential
   contributions of microalgae to emerging sectors are discussed, as in the
   production of biomaterials, agriculture-related products, biofuels and
   provision of services such as wastewater treatment and the clean-up of
   industrial gases. The different microalgal production technologies have
   also been analyzed to identify the main bottlenecks affecting microalgal
   use in different applications. Finally, the major challenges facing
   microalgal biotechnology in enlarging its contribution to the bioeconomy
   are evaluated, and future trends discussed.

AB Background: Remediation of wastewater using microalgae is an alternative
   way of reducing environmental impacts associated with wastewater
   treatment while simultaneously generating biomass that can be converted
   into biofuels. In this study, the phycoremediation of a secondary urban
   effluent by native microalgae was investigated using a photobioreactor
   designed to receive carbon dioxide (CO2). The experiments were carried
   out with and without CO2addition, and the physicochemical parameters of
   the effluent were monitored. The biomass yield was determined as the dry
   weight, and both the lipid and fatty acid profiles were obtained by gas
   chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Results: With respect
   to biomass production, lipid content and phycoremediation of the
   secondary urban effluent, the best results were observed in the
   experiments using CO2. In these experiments, reductions of biological
   oxygen demand (54.34%), total phosphorus (92.4%), ammoniacal nitrogen
   (97.1%) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (92.8%) were observed. The
   CO2addition also enhanced microalgae growth, as the maximum cell density
   (MCD) was 54.26% higher after a shorter period of time compared to the
   MCD obtained without CO2addition. The biomass yields were 0.5324  0.007
   g L-1and 0.821  0.014 g L-1without and with CO2addition, respectively.
   The lipid yields per unit of biomass for the CO2supplemented cultures
   were not statistically different from cultures that were not
   supplemented with CO2, and the same was observed for fatty acid
   composition. Conclusion: The use of the mixed-type photobioreactor has
   been shown to be a potential alternative method for biomass production
   and wastewater phycoremediation.

AB The current issues of the depletion of fossil fuels reserve and
   environmental changes have increased the concern for the hunt of
   sustainable renewable energy for the future generations. Biofuels
   emerged as a promising viable alternative to replace the existing fossil
   fuels. Among these, bioethanol outstands due to its ability to
   substitute gasoline. However, the major challenge in bioethanol industry
   is the need to discover a suitable feedstock together with an
   environmentally friendly approach and an economically feasible process
   of production. The first generation and second generation bioethanol
   appeared unsustainable due to its impact on food security as well as
   inflated production process. These problems and concerns have directed
   the search for the third generation bioethanol (TGB) feedstock from
   marine algae. The integration of algae (microalgae and macroalgae) as a
   sustainable feedstock for bioethanol has gained worldwide attention in
   terms of food security and environmental impact. The research on algal
   utilization in bioethanol has increased in recent years and is expected
   to become the major drives in bioethanol industry. Therefore, the
   potential and prospects of the third generation bioethanol feedstock are
   being highlighted in this review. An insight into the current hydrolysis
   and fermentation technologies on algal conversion together with the
   economics and viability of the process are also accounted. This review
   can be crucial in providing ideas for the future studies that can be
   implemented in the commercialization of bioethanol from the third
   generation feedstock.

AB Due to their high productivity in both crops and algae, tropical
   countries are likely to be the future world suppliers of feedstocks as
   well as biofuels such as biodiesel. In this work five feedstocks: palm,
   jatropha, microalgae, tallow and waste cooking oil were analyzed and
   compared using techno-economic and environmental criteria. For each
   feedstock, technological configurations currently used in the industry
   were taken into account (acid catalysis, basic catalysis and
   cogeneration). In this work, it was found that productivities for the
   basic catalyzed process were comparatively higher (1.010 kg biodiesel/kg
   crude oil), than those catalyzed by acid (0.85-0.95 kg biodiesel/kg
   crude oil). After the simulation of the selected processes, the lowest
   production costs were obtained for jatropha (USD 0.15/L, basic
   catalysis) and for waste cooking oils (USD 0.23/L, acid catalysis). The
   PEI (Potential Environmental Impact) generated for basic catalyzed
   process ranged from -0.04 to -0.09, while the acid catalyzed case -0.020
   and -0.06 PEI per kg of product. The jatropha and microalgae oil using
   basic catalyzed configuration with energy cogeneration were the best
   process alternative from the environmental and economical points of
   view.

AB In recent decades, there is an increasing interest to gradually replace
   fossil energy sources because of the environmental concerns associated
   to their use. Therefore, promising renewable energy sources such as
   bio-oil have attracted great attention. The aim of this work is to
   provide insights into the application of computer-aided tools for
   decision-making related to renewable energy-based projects. The
   influence of feedstocks on the process design for producing bio-oil is
   evaluated from environmental and exergy viewpoints. To this end, two
   different feedstocks were selected: (i) mixture of banana empty fruit
   bunches/corn stover, and (ii) microalgae Chlorella sp. The processing
   topologies for bio-oil production were simulated using Aspen Plus ,
   considering parameters such as operating conditions (temperature,
   pressure, among others). Exergy analysis was developed based on extended
   mass/energy balances, heat of reactions, work, among other parameters
   derived from process simulation. The Waste Reduction (WAR) algorithm was
   then applied to perform environmental analysis calculating potential
   environmental impacts. Thus, this work presented the exergetic and
   environmental comparison of two different low-cost feedstocks for
   renewable energy production. Results revealed that algal processing
   topology is the most convenient alternate based on exergy efficiency
   (~24%) and environmental performance (2.13*10-2 PEI output/kg;
   -3.22*10+1 PEI generated/kg).

   in biorefineries for various bioenergy and biochemicals. This review
   focuses on the microalgae contributions to Bio-Circular-Green (BCG)
   economy, in which zero-waste approaches for sustainable production and
   biorefineries of microalgal biomass are introduced and their possible
   integration is discussed. Firstly, overviews of wastewater upcycling and
   greenhouse gas capture by microalgae are given. Then, a variety of
   valuable products from microalgal biomass, e.g., pigments, vitamins,
   proteins/peptides, carbohydrates, lipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   and exopolysaccharides, are summarized to emphasize their biorefinery
   potential. Techno-economic and environmental analyses have been used to
   evaluate sustainability of microalgal biomass production systems.
   Finally, key issues, future perspectives, and challenges for zero-waste
   microalgal biorefineries, e.g., cost-effective techniques and innovative
   integrations with other viable processes, are discussed. These
   strategies not only make microalgae-based industries commercially
   feasible and sustainable but also reduce environmental impacts.

   "cradle-to-gate" inventory. The results revealed that among all the
   scenarios, cultivation in raceway pond was ascertained to be the most
   energy intensive process with the mode of culture mixing and biomass
   productivity being the principal determinants. The impacts were found to
   be directly linked to energy demand and had an inverse relationship with
   biomass productivity. The geographic location of the energy sources
   affected the environmental implications of a given process. The
   integration of defatted algal biomass waste derived electricity with the
   cultivation system showed a minor reduction in the overall energy
   demand.

AB Microalgae have been studied as a potential alternative raw material and
   various technologies have been proposed to transform the algal biomass
   into energy products. In this study, two bioenergy production systems of
   very different complexities were modelled to assess their environmental
   efficiencies: a biodiesel system and a biogas system. Biodiesel system
   used supercritical extraction and transesterification as key processes;
   to the best of authors' knowledge, there is no previous work analysing
   the environmental performances of such production system. Cumulative
   energy demand, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and dynamic LCA for climate
   change were used to evaluate the environmental footprint of the
   production systems. Conventional systems for electricity, heat and
   diesel production were considered for comparison. Energy balance showed
   that the supercritical extraction and drying steps were the most energy
   consuming unit operations in biodiesel production and further
   developments of technologies might be envisaged. LCA showed that climate
   change was the main contributor to impacts on human health and ecosystem
   quality due to energy consumed in production steps. Also, heat from
   biogas was the only product that proved to have a satisfactory
   environmental performance with regard to other conventional production
   systems. Finally, dynamic climate change evaluation (used for the first
   time for bio-chemical processes) revealed no carbon sequestration in
   microalgae system.

AB Written by leading experts in the field, Cyanobacteria: An Economic
   Perspective is a comprehensive edited volume covering all areas of an
   important field and its application to energy, medicine and agriculture.
   Issues related to environment, food and energy have presented serious
   challenge to the stability of nation-states. Increasing global
   population, dwindling agriculture and industrial production, and
   inequitable distribution of resources and technologies have further
   aggravated the problem. The burden placed by increasing population on
   environment and especially on agricultural productivity is phenomenal.
   To provide food and fuel to such a massive population, it becomes
   imperative to find new ways and means to increase the production giving
   due consideration to biosphere's ability to regenerate resources and
   provide ecological services. Cyanobacteria are environment friendly
   resource for commercial production of active biochemicals, drugs and
   future energy (biodiesel, bioethanol and hydrogen). Topics on isolation,
   identification and classification of cyanobacteria are discussed, as
   well as further sections on: summarizing a range of useful products
   synthesized by cyanobacteria, ecological services provided by
   cyanobacteria including their harmful effect in water bodies and
   associated flora and fauna. Chapter on tools, techniques, and patents
   also focus on the economic importance of the group. This book also
   provides an insight for future perspectives in each particular field and
   an extensive bibliography. This book will be a highly useful resource
   for students, researchers and professionals in academics in the life
   sciences including microbiology and biotechnology.

AB Green technologies are in demand worldwide to meet the fuel needs of the
   increasing population together with combating global warming. Although
   biofuels from conventional energy crops and lignocellulosic biomass can
   substitute for fossil fuels, there is much controversy over questions
   raised regarding impacts on food supply and security and their cost
   effectiveness. A high photosynthetic efficiency and production rate
   confer algae with attractive credentials for third-generation biofuels.
   Algae (both microalgae and macroalgae) represent an economical and
   environmentally sustainable renewable source of biomass for the
   production of biofuels. Algal biofuels are attractive in that they do
   not compromise food supplies and arable land. Microalgae have hitherto
   received more attention than macroalgae. Nevertheless, the latter can
   also serve as a viable option for biofuel generation. Carbohydrates
   obtained from macroalgal biomass can be used for fermentative production
   of bioethanol. Macroalgal biomass can store large amounts of oil which
   can be exploited for the production of biodiesel. Methane and hydrogen
   can readily be produced from macroalgal biomass through biologically
   mediated degradation. The biorefinery approach, integrating
   bioprocessing and low-environmental-impact chemical technologies, would
   be more pertinent in effecting maximum and efficient utilization of
   macroalgal biomass through the generation of diverse products from a
   single biomass feedstock. This review encompasses the potential and
   prospects of macroalgae as sources for biofuels and the role of
   biorefinery approach in invigorating macroalgal fuel economy.

AB Microalgae biotechnology is a promising pathway to cope with CO2
   emission and energy crisis due to high CO2 fixation rate and lipids
   productivity. However, bottlenecks of high energy cost, low
   photosynthetic efficiency and poor economic feasibility severely hinder
   its commercialization. Understanding process mechanisms of microalgae
   photosynthetic CO2 fixation and lipids production, and thus seeking
   possible regulations to enhance weak links are potential process
   regulation strategy for augmented competitiveness. Firstly, mass
   transfer and conversion processes of microalgae photosynthesis involving
   CO2 and light were comprehensively illuminated in this review. In
   detail, mechanisms of CO2 and light transfer in microalgae suspension,
   bioavailable carbon and photon assimilation by microalgae cells, as well
   as intracellular mass conversion were illustrated. Besides, synergistic
   effects of light and CO2 on microalgae photosynthesis were depicted from
   perspective of electrons and protons supply-demand relationships between
   photosynthetic photo-reaction and dark-reaction steps in chlorophyll.
   Possible weak links in these processes were emphasized to provide
   guideline for regulation. Secondly, available regulation strategies for
   CO2 and light mass transfer, cellular assimilation and intracellular
   conversion were summarized. Subsequently, economic and environmental
   impacts of process regulation on microalgae CO2 fixation and biodiesel
   output were evaluated to lit up large-scale applicability. Finally,
   challenges and future directions of microalgae biotechnology were
   described to inspire in-depth research and engineering practice. This
   review may provide a novel process regulation standpoint for operating
   microalgae-based CO2 fixation and biodiesel production in the most
   efficient manner, further facilitating the applicability of microalgae
   biotechnology towards carbon neutrality and biodiesel production.

AB Despite a substantial literature using life cycle assessment (LCA)
   approach, the extent to which second and third generation biofuels are
   more sustainable than the first generation remains a subject of debate.
   Although the existence of limitations due to LCA variability and
   uncertainty, this paper intends to determine global tendencies based on
   a statistic and critical interpretation of previously published study
   results, reviewing 61 recent papers addressing an environmental
   evaluation of microalgae biofuels. Such information is compared to the
   same impact indicators for fossil fuels and for ethanol and biodiesel
   from terrestrial crops in Europe and Brazil. For each case, the system
   boundaries and the methodological choices were precisely described. The
   sustainability potential of all biofuels was evaluated by the Global
   Warming Potential (GWP), the Energy Ratio (ER) and the Land Use (LU),
   allowing a broad estimation of the biofuels' contribution to climate
   change mitigation, their net energy efficiency and their competiveness
   with food production chain. The results highlight that algae-derived
   biodiesel is, by far, the most efficient alternative in terms of land
   use compared to other biofuels, avoiding competition with food crops.
   Some biodiesel pathways can also satisfactorily perform in terms of
   greenhouse gases emissions reduction, but some others can be even worst
   than fossil diesel. Nevertheless, in terms of energy efficiency, algae
   biofuels cannot compete with other biofuels or fossil fuels. They
   present very low performances, even demanding more energy for its
   production then the energy they can deliver. Moreover, no pathway can be
   conclusively selected as preferable between the two main technologies
   available for microalgae biodiesel due to high uncertainties. However,
   open raceway pounds technology seems to be preferable as it looks less
   GHG intensive, requiring lower energy input and land use. Energetic and
   GWP performances can be improved if production pathways are carefully
   chosen and optimized.

AB Owing to the need to redesign the energy infrastructure due to reducing

   shifted to biofuels. However, microalgal biofuels are not yet viable
   because of low productivity of biomass and compounds such as lipids and
   carbohydrates and the technological limitations in harvesting and
   collecting microalgal bioproducts. In order to improve the potential of
   microalgal biofuels, stress strategies are being developed to optimize
   the cultivation processes. New methods of harvesting are being proposed
   considering the costs involved. This review discusses strategies for
   carbohydrate and lipid accumulation in microalgae biomass and
   harvesting, focusing on the use of coagulation and flocculation methods.
   We also present the evaluation of costs of different harvesting methods,

AB To date, the positive environmental impact of microalgae-based
   technologies has been demonstrated in numerous studies. However, there
   is still a number of major technical and economic obstacles to overcome.
   Therefore, further research and innovation are needed for the
   development and commercial exploitation of large-scale integrated and
   sustainable processes, based on robust 'industrial' microalgal strains
   and novel photobioreactors (PBRs). Note that the advancement of
   intensified microalgal cultivation processes can facilitate the
   economically feasible co-production of microalgal biomass and
   value-added biochemicals. In this context, the goal of the present
   investigation was to compare several microalgal strains based on a set
   of productivity criteria, including the maximum biomass growth and the
   maximum concentration of total biochemicals (i.e., carbohydrates,
   proteins, and lipids) under CO2excess conditions (10%v/v). It was found
   that the wild type strain ofStichococcussp. fully meets the above
   productivity criteria. In particular, a biomass concentration of 1.68
   g.L-1and a concentration of total biochemical products of 1.4 g.L-1were
   measured in batch cultivation experiments in flasks using the selected
   strain. Further studies were performed in two different PBRs.
   Cultivation in a conventional stirred tank PBR showed successful scaling
   of the bioprocess, whereas cultivation in an innovative tubular
   recirculating PBR resulted in maximization of both biomass concentration
   (3.66 g.L-1) and total biochemical products concentration (3.33 g.L-1).

AB In order for microalgae-based processes to reach commercial production
   for biofuels and high-value products such as omega-3 fatty acids, it is
   necessary that economic feasibility be demonstrated at the industrial
   scale. Therefore, process optimization is critical to ensure that the
   maximum yield can be achieved from the most efficient use of resources.
   This is particularly true for processes involving heterotrophic
   microalgae, which have not been studied as extensively as phototrophic
   microalgae. An area that has received significant conceptual praise, but
   little experimental validation, is that of nutrient recycling, where the
   waste materials from prior cultures and post-lipid extraction are reused
   for secondary fermentations. While the concept is very simple and could
   result in significant economic and environmental benefits, there are
   some underlying challenges that must be overcome before adoption of
   nutrient recycling is viable at commercial scale. Even more, adapting
   nutrient recycling for optimized heterotrophic cultures presents some
   added challenges that must be identified and addressed that have been
   largely unexplored to date. These challenges center on carbon and
   nitrogen recycling and the implications of using waste materials in
   conjunction with virgin nutrients for secondary cultures. The aim of
   this review is to provide a foundation for further understanding of
   nutrient recycling for microalgae cultivation. As such, we outline the
   current state of technology and practical challenges associated with
   nutrient recycling for heterotrophic microalgae on an industrial scale
   and give recommendations for future work.

AB Fossil fuels have remained a major global energy source for many
   decades, and their use has lingered on with downbeat attendants,
   considering their high demands and environmental issues caused by
   overexploitation and exploration. The increase in global energy
   consumption, emerging issues of climate change, and perceived decline in
   fossil reserves due to the world's increasing population has raised
   serious concerns and clamor for the replacement of fossil fuel with
   biological substitutes. Biodiesels have received much attention in all
   countries due to their renewability, non-toxicity, biodegradability, and
   low pollution emissions, and are projected as a promising alternative to
   fossil fuels. Although biodiesel is mainly a derivative of
   edible/non-edible plant oil extractions, in this review, biodiesel
   derived from non-vegetable oils e.g. animal fats/waste, leather industry
   waste, lipids from microalgae, insects, and waste rubber tires were
   explored as potential biodiesel feedstocks. In addition, waste materials
   as heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production, environmental and
   economic impacts were also highlighted. Noteworthily, the
   transesterification of these non-vegetable oil feedstock to biodiesel in
   the presence of waste materials as heterogeneous catalysts could afford
   up to 98% biodiesel production, and the catalyst can be recycled. The
   inherent ability to compensate for the quantity supply of biodiesel is
   the aim of every energy-producing nation in order to maximize economic
   development and minimize pollution in the environment.

AB Energy and energy services are the backbone of growth and development in
   India and is increasingly dependent upon the use of fossil based fuels
   that lead to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and related concerns.
   Algal biofuels are being evolved as carbon (C)-neutral alternative
   biofuels. Algae are photosynthetic microorganisms that convert sunlight,
   water and carbon dioxide (CO2) to various sugars and lipids
   Tri-Acyl-Glycols (TAG) and show promise as an alternative, renewable and
   green fuel source for India. Compared to land based oilseed crops algae
   have potentially higher yields (5-12 g/m2/d) and can use locations and
   water resources not suited for agriculture. Within India, there is
   little additional land area for algal cultivation and therefore needs to
   be carried out in places that are already used for agriculture, e.g.
   flooded paddy lands (20 Mha) with village level technologies and on
   saline wastelands (3 Mha). Cultivating algae under such conditions
   requires novel multi-tier, multi-cyclic approaches of sharing land area
   without causing threats to food and water security as well as demand for
   additional fertilizer resources by adopting multi-tier cropping
   (algae-paddy) in decentralized open pond systems. A large part of the
   algal biofuel production is possible in flooded paddy crop land before
   the crop reaches dense canopies, in wastewaters (40 billion litres per
   day), in salt affected lands and in nutrient/diversity impoverished
   shallow coastline fishery. Mitigation will be achieved through avoidance
   of GHG, C-capture options and substitution of fossil fuels. Estimates
   made in this paper suggest that nearly half of the current
   transportation petro-fuels could be produced at such locations without
   disruption of food security, water security or overall sustainability.
   This shift can also provide significant mitigation avenues. The major
   adaptation needs are related to socio-technical acceptance for reuse of
   various wastelands, wastewaters and waste-derived energy and by-products
   through policy and attitude change efforts.

AB Production of biodiesel from edible plant oils is quickly expanding
   worldwide to fill a need for renewable, environmentally-friendly liquid
   transportation fuels. Due to concerns over use of edible commodities for
   fuels, production of biodiesel from non-edible oils including microbial
   oils is being developed. Microalgae biodiesel is approaching commercial
   viability, but has some inherent limitations such as requirements for
   sunlight. While yeast oils have been studied for decades, recent years
   have seen significant developments including discovery of new oleaginous
   yeast species and strains, greater understanding of the metabolic
   pathways that determine oleaginicity, optimization of cultivation
   processes for conversion of various types of waste plant biomass to oil
   using oleaginous yeasts, and development of strains with enhanced oil
   production. This review examines aspects of oleaginous yeasts not
   covered in depth in other recent reviews. Topics include the history of
   oleaginous yeast research, especially advances in the early 20th
   century; the phylogenetic diversity of oleaginous species, beyond the
   few species commonly studied; and physiological characteristics that
   should be considered when choosing yeast species and strains to be
   utilized for conversion of a given type of plant biomass to
   oleochemicals. Standardized terms are proposed for units that describe
   yeast cell mass and lipid production.

AB Brazilian ethanol production generates approximately 351 billion liters
   yearly of vinasse that is mostly used for fertigation, but with
   significant environmental impact. This research aims at comparing the
   growth ofChlorella vulgarison three different media preparation using
   raw vinasse, diluted vinasse, and vinasse treated by anaerobic
   digestion; all under four distinct treatments or supplementations
   (antibiotic, nitrogen and phosphorous). The results show thatC
   vulgarisgrows poorly on raw vinasse alone or after supplementation.
   However, 11-13 mg L-1day-1of algal oil can be produced with diluted or
   anaerobically treated vinasse. The first would require antibiotic,
   nitrogen and phosphorous supplementation and the later only antibiotic
   supplementation. Whilst using diluted vinasse may reduce work input, it
   requires significant amounts of clean water. The use of anaerobically
   treated vinasse requires some additional work and investment, but it can
   generate 122 mL CH4g-1CODvinasse(10-26.4 m3of biogas from 1m3of
   vinasse). Thus, the association of methane and algal oil production from
   vinasse is an effective approach for removing inorganic nutrients and
   potentially toxic organics from this effluent before discharge. The
   quality of the algal oil produced is affected by culturing conditions
   and anaerobically treated vinasse produced the best results in this area
   according to the estimated parameters of the biodiesel.

AB Energy security concerns have led to the search for alternative and
   renewable energy resources. Biomass with high lipid content is an
   attractive feedstock for producing renewable fuels. Biomass-derived fats
   and oils can be readily converted into biodiesel via the well-studied
   transesterification process. However, owing to the alcohol component of
   biodiesel, which contains oxygen, it cannot serve as a fully-fledged
   replacement for conventional petrodiesel. In this respect, renewable
   diesel obtained via catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lipid-based
   feedstocks is a more attractive and fungible option. This process makes
   it possible to produce fuels with the chemical composition
   indistinguishable from that of petroleum-derived products. Since all
   kinds of biomass have high oxygen content, comprehensive research of the
   catalytic HDO process arouses great interest. This article aims to
   review state-of-the-art studies related to the catalytic HDO of
   lipid-based feedstocks from the last decade. The suitability of
   microalgae as a feedstock for renewable fuel production, as well as the
   possible advantages of processing lipid-based feedstocks using aqueous
   HDO, are also addressed in this review.

AB The environmental sustainability of second-generation biodiesel
   (used-cooking-oil) was examined, at industrial-scale, in Greece. The
   total carbon and environmental footprint per tonne of biodiesel
   production was ~0.55t CO2eq (i.e. ~14g CO2eq/MJ) and 58.37 Pt,
   respectively. This is ~40% lower compared to first-generation biodiesel,
   an order of magnitude lower than the third-generation (microalgae),
   since the latter is not a fully-fledged technology yet. A threefold
   reduction in environmental impacts was observed compared to petrodiesel.
   Environmental hotspots include energy inputs to drive the process,
   followed by methanol (CH3OH) and potassium methoxide (CH3KO)
   consumption. Glycerol (C3H8O3) and potassium sulfate (K2SO4), both
   process co-products, resulted to avoided environmental burdens.
   Furthermore, used-cooking-oil valorisation for biodiesel production can
   address water pollution concerns from its disposal to the sewage system.
   The total distance and means of transport were found to influence the
   system's environmental sustainability. Strong incentives for
   used-cooking-oil recycling, widespread collection systems, and biodiesel
   supply chain optimization are still pending in Greece, Europe, and
   further afield. Given its overall low environmental footprint and
   capability to be produced at commercial scales, the second-generation
   biodiesel, which currently represents 15% of the biodiesel market in
   Greece, could act as a stepping-stone in decarbonizing Europe's
   transport sector and improving supply and energy security.

AB Increased demand for energy and the scarcity of fossil fuels has led to
   the search for an alternative source that is sustainable as well as
   environmentally friendly, has the potential to function similarly to
   conventional fuels, contributes to less air pollution, and utilizes the
   maximum number of available natural sources in order to reduce the cost
   of production while achieving a higher yield at the same time. One such
   popular alternative is biodiesel, a renewable, biodegradable, and
   portable fuel that is sulfur-free, has enough oxygen content, is less
   toxic, and has a comparatively easier manufacturing process. Biodiesel
   is produced through a Trans-esterification process that involves the
   conversion of triglycerides in the presence of a catalyst and alcohol
   producing mono alkyl ester of long-chain fatty acids, i.e., biodiesel,
   along with glycerol as a byproduct. Biodiesel can be produced from a
   versatile range of feed-stocks, from edible sources like Rapeseed oil,
   Peanut oil, Soybean oil, Sunflower oil, canola oil, Palm oil, etc. to
   non-edible tree-borne oilseeds such as Neem oil, Cottonseed oil, Castor
   oil, Jojoba oil, Ratanjyot, Mahua, etc. to even waste cooking oil,
   animal fat, and microalgal oil. Along with flexibility in feed-stocks, a
   variety of catalysts can also be used in the production of biodiesel via
   Transesterification. This study is an attempt to highlight the process
   of Transesterification, the impact of biodiesel on the environment and
   human health.

TI Life cycle assessment of anaerobic digestion of pig manure coupled with

SO Environment International
VL 137

U1 13
U2 143
AB The direct use of digestate on farmlands as soil amendment is becoming
   an uneconomic option for farmers. Moreover, there are serious
   environmental concerns about its oversupply in regions with intensive
   biogas plants. Downstream technologies, offering innovative upcycling
   methods to handle huge amounts of digestate, have absorbed great
   interest in this context. In this study, three digestate treatment
   technologies were compared from a life cycle assessment perspective to
   combine the environmental impacts from pig manure transportation to
   biogas plants, biogas production, different digestate treatment
   technologies, and the use of final products. The results showed that
   scenario including digestate fractionation into solid and liquid, and
   their use for compost production and microalgae cultivation,
   respectively, would be a suitable downstream strategy with lower impacts
   on human health, ecosystem quality, and climate change damage
   categories, however future improvements still required. The results
   showed that sealed storage system or fast-continuous downstream
   processes as well as shorter distances between biogas plants and farms
   can significantly enhance the environmental performance of coupled
   anaerobic digestion and microalgae production. The high energy payback
   also signified that co-digestion of pig manure and microalgae would be
   energetically favorable in this context. However, having compared the
   results with a baseline scenario demonstrated that the direct use of
   digestate on farmlands, under controlled conditions to avoid its over
   application, is still the most environmentally favorable option, despite
   being a costly option for farmers. The results achieved in the present
   study suffered some uncertainties because technologies under
   consideration are at their infancy stage, thus further research still is
   required to find the most sustainable solutions.

U1 0
U2 11
AB Plant design implies the best choice among a set of feedstock-to-product
   process pathways. Multiple sustainability performance indicators can
   blur the decision, and existing sustainability assessment methods
   usually focus only on environmental life-cycle performance and corporate
   metrics or solely on the gate-to-gate process. It is relevant to
   incorporate integrated system analysis to address sustainability
   comprehensively. To this end, the Sustainable Process Systems
   Engineering (S-PSE) method was previously introduced to select the most
   sustainable feedstock-process-product configuration via four-dimensional
   indicators (environment, efficiency, health-&-safety, and economic), and
   then pinpoint the sustainability hotspots of the best design to unveil
   possible improvements. This work expands S-PSE by adding new features:
   (i) cradle-to-gate environmental assessment; (ii) composition of
   flowsheets; (iii) new indicators; (iv) statistical screening of
   indicators; and (v) 2030 Agenda compliance. A biorefinery case-study
   demonstrates S-PSE: to select the best pathway from soybean-oil,
   palm-oil, and microalgae-oil to biodiesel, green-diesel, and
   propylene-glycol. Firstly, statistical screening reduces the indicator
   set by 62%. Results evince all routes from microalgae-oil as
   economically unfeasible due to oil cost, despite superior environmental
   performance. S-PSE evinces palm-oil-to-biodiesel as the most sustainable
   due to lower cradle-to-gate emissions and manufacturing cost, with
   sustainability hotspots associated to hazardous methanol input and
   energy-intensive distillations. 2030 Agenda analysis also outlines
   palm-oil-to-biodiesel as best for 5 out of 10 Sustainable Development
   Goals linked to the reduced indicator set.

AB With realizing the potential of algal biomass as a good natural resource
   for the harnessing of valuable bioproducts, algal biomass production has
   gained a lot of interest in recent years. However, due to some
   limitations such as low harvesting efficiency, higher nutrient supply,
   and high water requirement, the production of algal biomass is
   uneconomical. Over the past several years, researchers are continuously
   working on growing algae as a biofilm for easy microalgae harvesting,
   concentration of algal biomass to a great extent, and requiring less
   quantity of water as compared to other microalgae cultivation methods.
   Most of the documented studies have been carried out on either use of
   algal biomass for tertiary treatment of wastewater or cultivation and
   harvesting of algal biomass for biofuel production. Limited research
   studies have documented other applications of the algal biofilm system.
   The present review paper summarizes the current knowledge on various
   factors affecting microalgae growth, development of algal biofilm, and
   operation of algal biofilm systems to help properly understand and
   optimize these factors for better economics, more positive environmental
   impacts, and successful potential applications of the attached growth
   systems. The important factors include the structure of algal biofilms,
   EPS matrix, supporting materials, nutrient availability, environmental
   conditions, and biofilm thickness and harvesting frequency. The
   potential applications such as wastewater treatment, CO2sequestration,
   microalgae-microbial fuel cell, large-scale biomass production, and
   water quality improvement are also discussed.

U1 4

AB Microalgae have enormous potential as feedstock for biofuel production
   compared with other sources, due to their high areal productivity,
   relatively low environmental impact, and low impact on food security.
   However, high production costs are the major limitation for
   commercialization of algal biofuels. Strategies to maximize biomass and
   lipid production are crucial for improving the economics of using
   microalgae for biofuels. Selection of suitable algal strains, preferably
   from indigenous habitats, and further improvement of those 'platform
   strains' using mutagenesis and genetic engineering approaches are
   desirable. Conventional approaches to improve biomass and lipid
   productivity of microalgae mainly involve manipulation of nutritional
   (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorus) and environmental (e.g. temperature,
   light and salinity) factors. Approaches such as the addition of
   phytohormones, genetic and metabolic engineering, and co-cultivation of
   microalgae with yeasts and bacteria are more recent strategies to
   enhance biomass and lipid productivity of microalgae. Improvement in
   culture systems and the use of a hybrid system (i.e. a combination of
   open ponds and photobioreactors) is another strategy to optimize algal
   biomass and lipid production. In addition, the use of low-cost
   substrates such as agri-industrial wastewater for the cultivation of
   microalgae will be a smart strategy to reduce production costs. Such
   systems not only generate high algal biomass and lipid productivity, but
   are also useful for bioremediation of wastewater and bioremoval of waste
   CO2. The aim of this review is to highlight the advances in the use of
   various strategies to enhance production of algal biomass and lipids for
   biofuel feedstock.

AB Petroleum dependency is a challenge that can potentially be partly
   offset by agricultural production of biofuels, while decreasing net,
   non-renewable carbon dioxide output. Plants have not been domesticated
   for modern biofuel production, and the quickest, most efficient, and
   often, the only way to convert plants to biofuel feedstocks is
   biotechnologically. First generation biofuel feedstock sources:
   sugarcane and cereal grains to produce bioethanol and biobutanol and
   oilseeds to produce biodiesel compete directly with needs for world food
   security. The heavy use of oilseed rape releases quantities of methyl
   bromide to the atmosphere, which can be prevented by gene suppression.
   Second generation bioethanolic/biobutanolic biofuels will come from
   cultivated lignocellulosic crops or straw wastes. These presently
   require heat and acid to remove lignin, which could be partially
   replaced by transgenically reducing or modifying lignin content and
   upregulating cellulose biosynthesis. Non-precipitable silicon emissions
   from burning could be reduced by transgenically modulating silicon
   content. The shrubby Jatropha and castor beans should have highly toxic
   protein components transgenically removed from their meal, cancer
   potentiating diterpenes removed from the oils, and allergens from the
   pollen, before extensive cultivation. Algae and cyanobacteria for third
   generation biodiesel need transgenic manipulation to deal with "weeds",
   light penetration, photoinhibition, carbon assimilation, etc. The
   possibilities of producing fourth generation biohydrogen and
   bioelectricity using photosynthetic mechanisms are being explored. There
   seem to be no health or environmental impact study requirements when the
   undomesticated biofuel crops are grown, yet there are illogically
   stringent requirements should they transgenically be rendered less toxic
   and more efficient as biofuel crops.

AB The need for sustainable agricultural practices to meet the food, feed,
   and fuel demands of a growing global population while reducing
   detrimental environmental impacts has driven research in multi-faceted
   approaches to agricultural sustainability. Perennial cropping systems
   and microbial biofertilizer supplements are two emerging strategies to
   increase agricultural sustainability that are studied in tandem for the
   first time in this study. During the establishment phase of a perennial
   switchgrass stand in SW Montana, USA, we supplemented synthetic
   fertilization with a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial biofertilizer (CBF)
   and were able to maintain aboveground crop productivity in comparison to
   a synthetic only (urea) fertilizer treatment. Soil chemical analysis
   conducted at the end of the growing season revealed that late-season
   nitrogen availability in CBF-supplemented field plots increased relative
   to urea-only plots. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial/archaeal and
   fungal communities suggested fine-scale responses of the microbial
   community and sensitivity to fertilization among arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Given their
   critical role in plant productivity and soil nutrient cycling, soil
   microbiome monitoring is vital to understand the impacts of
   implementation of alternative agricultural practices on soil health.

TI Mono- and diglyceride production from microalgae: challenges and

AB Background: Monoglycerides (MAG) and Diglycerides (DAG) belong to the
   category of naturally-occurring glycerolipids. They have wide
   applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries, with
   commercial demand supplied by the consolidated industrial catalytic
   route of vegetable oil glycerolysis. Despite the economic
   competitiveness of producing these types of emulsifiers from vegetable
   oils, the increasing demand for products with high nutrition value makes
   some kinds of microalgae oil potential feedstock of high-quality fatty
   acids to serve this growing market. Scope and approach: An alternative
   to the use of vegetable oils is the production of triacylglycerols from
   microalgae. Usually, microalgal oils have a high content of
   Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) and the cultivation of microalgae may
   present fewer environmental impacts, considering reduced use of arable
   land, efficient CO2 biofixation, and high productivity. Microalgae
   lipids are mostly studied for biodiesel production, but this work shows
   the potential to explore more valuable applications due to their
   composition, discussing the possibility of producing MAGs and DAGs from
   microalgae lipids. Key findings and conclusions: While biodiesel
   B99-B100 costs USD3.56/gallon according to the U.S. Energy Dept. (April
   2021), a food emulsifier (soybean lecithin) is sold for USD147/kg (Alfa
   Aesar, August 2021). Hence, it is imperative to consider high-value
   bioproducts from an economic point of view. Microalgal oil can be rich
   in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, being a promising source of MAGs and
   DAGs with higher nutritional value. Glycerolysis studies of this
   feedstock are restricted to the enzymatic route, but different
   alternatives are shown in this work.

AB In this paper, a detailed review on the recent advances in the
   production of biofuels and biochemicals from microalgae and Jatropha is
   presented. This review includes critical elements of the sustainability
   of microalgae and Jatropha biorefineries such as technical analysis,
   socioeconomic considerations, and environmental impact assessments that
   are reported in recent studies. The integration of microalgae and
   Jatropha as viable feedstock for the production of biofuels and
   biochemicals which may serve as sustainable alternatives to fossils
   fuels and petrochemicals is also modeled using SuperPro designer. A
   technoeconomic assessment of the integrated biorefinery is carried out.
   United Arab Emirates (UAE) is considered as a geographical reference for
   the technoeconomic assessment. Three scenarios are examined. All
   scenarios involve the production of biodiesel and glycerol. In addition
   to these two products, the production of animal feed, organic fertilizer
   and biogas is considered in scenario 1. In scenario 2, the biorefinery
   products include bioethanol, organic fertilizer and biogas. Scenario 3
   involves the production of hydrogen and animal feed. Scenario 1 is the
   base case, with which other scenarios are compared. Scenario 1 is
   profitable but scenarios 2 and 3 are not profitable. In addition,
   emissions from scenario 2 make it less attractive when it is compared to
   other scenarios. The integrated biorefinery with microalgae and Jatropha
   as feedstock is technically feasible and economically profitable in
   scenario 1, as modeled.

AB Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of
   triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging
   from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However,
   obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the
   accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200
   drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that
   trigger TAG accumulation in the diatomPhaeodactylum tricornutum. Using
   this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent
   manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell
   division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and
   transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly
   acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a
   synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known
   for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol
   impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered
   the recycling of fatty acids from membrane lipids to TAG. TheP.
   tricornutumtranscriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol
   was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to
   acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of
   ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated
   cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty acid elongase, Delta6-ELO-B1, might be
   involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
   acids and fatty acid turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new
   perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential
   target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also
   unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors,
   highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.

AB Coal-fired power plants are major stationary sources of carbon dioxide
   and environmental constraints demand technologies for abatement.
   Although Carbon Capture and Storage is the most mature route, it poses
   severe economic penalty to power generation. Alternatively, this penalty
   is potentially reduced by Carbon Capture and Utilization, which converts
   carbon dioxide to valuable products, monetizing it. This work evaluates
   a route consisting of carbon dioxide bio-capture by Chlorella
   pyrenoidosa and use of the resulting biomass as feedstock to a
   microalgae-based biorefinery; Carbon Capture and Storage route is
   evaluated as a reference technology. The integrated arrangement
   comprises: (a) carbon dioxide biocapture in a photobioreactor, (b) oil
   extraction from part of the produced biomass, (b) gasification of
   remaining biomass to obtain bio-syngas, and (c) conversion of bio-syngas
   to methanol. Calculation of capital and operational expenditures are
   estimated based on mass and energy balances obtained by process
   simulation for both routes (Carbon Capture and Storage and the
   biorefinery). Capital expenditure for the biorefinery is higher by a
   factor of 6.7, while operational expenditure is lower by a factor of
   0.45 and revenues occur only for this route, with a ratio
   revenue/operational expenditure of 1.6. The photobioreactor is
   responsible for one fifth of the biorefinery capital expenditure, with
   footprint of about 1000 ha, posing the most significant barrier for
   technical and economic feasibility of the proposed biorefinery. The
   Biorefinery and Carbon Capture and Storage routes show carbon dioxide
   capture efficiency of 73% and 48%, respectively, with capture cost of
   139$/t and 304$/t. Additionally, the biorefinery has superior
   performance in all evaluated metrics of environmental impacts.

AB With the increasing participation of biomass in the world energy matrix,
   large amounts of ash are produced through combustion, resulting in the
   need to dispose of this waste to minimize the environmental impact. An
   alternative is to use ashes as phosphorus supplements in microalgae
   cultures. The present work describes the development and use of a
   balanced culture medium based on the minimal processing of oil palm
   biomass ash to cultivateArthrospira platensisParacas, Neochloris
   oleoabundans UTEX 1185, and Dunaliella salina SAG 184. The acid
   extraction process of phosphorus (P) was defined by evaluating the
   following parameters: temperature (20 to 70°C), acid load (0.01 to 0.03
   mols/g of ash) of HNO3, and liquid/solid ratio (50 to 150 mLg-1). The
   best efficiency of the extraction process was 97%. The use of
   HNO3allowed for the production of an extract containing balanced amounts
   of N and P sources, the BAX medium (Biomass Ash Extract). This medium
   was efficient for cultivating the three microorganisms studied, reaching
   biomass concentrations of 2.03, 0.902, and 0.69 g/L or 84%, 82%, and 99%
   of the control concentrations forA. platensis, N. Oleoabundans, and D.
   salina, respectively. In a final scaling-up test,A. platensisshowed
   productivity of 0.047 g L-1d-1in a 120 L tank in a greenhouse. BAX can
   be an alternative nutrient medium for microalgae cultivation, especially
   in integration with biomass-fueled biorefineries.

AB The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and ever-increasing environmental
   pollution have forced humankind to look for a renewable energy source.
   Microalgae, a renewable biomass source, has been proposed as a promising
   feedstock to generate biofuels due to their fast growth rate with high
   lipid content. However, literatures have indicated that sustainable
   production of microalgae biofuels are only viable with a highly
   optimized production system. In the present study, a cradle-to-gate
   approach was used to provide expedient insights on the effect of
   different cultivation systems and biomass productivity toward life cycle
   energy (LCEA), carbon balance (LCCO2) and economic (LCC) of microalgae
   biodiesel production pathways. In addition, a co-production of
   bioethanol from microalgae residue was proposed in order to improve the
   economic sustainability of the overall system. The results attained in
   the present work indicated that traditional microalgae biofuels
   processing pathways resulted to several shortcomings, such as
   dehydration and lipid extraction of microalgae biomass required high
   energy input and contributed nearly 21 to 30% and 39 to 57% of the total
   energy requirement, respectively. Besides, the microalgae biofuels
   production system also required a high capital investment, which
   accounted for 47 to 86% of total production costs that subsequently
   resulted to poor techno-economic performances. Moreover, current
   analysis of environmental aspects of microalgae biorefinery had revealed
   negative CO2 balance in producing microalgae biofuels.

AB Produced water (PW) is an effluent from the petrochemical industry that
   has a significant environmental impact due to its high salinity and
   presence of chemical compounds and heavy metal. Microalgae have been
   considered promising to phytoremediation of this effluent and producing
   biomass with high added value. Therefore, this study aimed to stimulate
   the production of biomass and biomolecules fromChlorella vulgarisby
   supplementation with PW and evaluate the synergistic effect of sources
   of physical and chemical stress.C. vulgariswas cultivated in different
   PW concentations of PW (not autoclaved) and BG11 medium under a 24 h
   photoperiod, with inoculum pre-adapted the same photoperiod. The culture
   containing 70% of BG11 and 30% PW (PW 30%) was the most viable, with a
   biomass production of 1.35 g/L and a higher concentration of
   carbohydrates (37.46%) and ash (18.21%) than the control culture (100%
   BG11). Furthermore, PW 30% also resulted in considerable amounts of
   lipids (9.92%), proteins (21.94%), chlorophyll-a(6.64 mug/mL),
   chlorophyll-b(10.57 mug/ mL), and carotenoids (21.38 mug/mL). The major
   fatty acids were C18:3n6 (21.50%), C20:0 (19.96%), C16:0 (17.12%), and
   C18:0 (12.15%). The PW 30% treatment showed removal efficiencies for
   iron (61.80%), chlorides (79.64%), phosphates (97.18%), and petroleum
   hydrocarbons including total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH; 45.39%) and
   resolved petroleum hydrocarbons (RPH; 57.57%). The analyzed fuel
   properties presented an ideal profile for the production of biodiesel
   and bioethanol, which can be obtained from carbohydrates.
   Simultaneously, treatment PW 30% resulted in the production of
   biomolecule-rich in biomass in addition to the bioremediation effect.

VL 918
PY 2024
U1 9
U2 28
AB In the past decade, there has been a significant rise in sustainable
   biomass based biofuel production to address energy needs while
   mitigating environmental impacts. Traditionally, bioethanol was used for
   biofuel production, but concerns over food security and environmental
   preservation have led to growing interest in alternative sources such as
   neutral lipids from vegetable oil and microalgae for biodiesel
   production. This research paper evaluates the potential of various
   oleaginous plants and microalgae as feedstocks for biodiesel production,
   with a focus on their fatty acid composition and its impact on biodiesel
   properties. The study examines the fatty acid profiles of 43 different
   plant and microalgae species and employs various equations to estimate
   key physical properties of biodiesel. Additionally, the communication
   compares these properties to International Biodiesel Standards (EN 14214
   and ASTM D6751-08) to assess the suitability of the derived biodiesel
   for commercial use. It is impossible to describe a single composition
   that is optimal in terms of all essential fuel properties due to the
   opposing effects of some structural features of the Fatty Acid Methyl
   Esters (FAME). However, biodiesel should contain relatively low
   concentrations of both long chain saturated and polyunsaturated FAME to
   ensure adequate efficiency in terms of low temperature operability and
   oxidative stability. The results reveal significant variations in
   properties amongst different feedstocks, highlighting the importance of
   feedstock selection in biodiesel production. The study also establishes
   correlations between various fuel properties, providing valuable
   insights in to optimizing biodiesel production processes, which will be
   of great use to researchers, engineers, and stakeholders involved in
   biodiesel production.

AB The growing need to use biofuel raw materials that do not compete with
   food and feed have resulted in a growing interest in lignocellulosic
   materials and microalgae. However, the life cycle environmental benefits
   of both biofuels have been questioned. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate how environmental sustainability of forest-based and microalgae
   biodiesel can be estimated by using the life cycle assessment framework.
   These biofuel chains were chosen because they are contrasting systems,
   as the first one is based on a "natural" feedstock production system,
   while the second one is an entirely anthropogenic system using an
   artificial infrastructure and external inputs to grow microalgae. This
   study focuses on life cycle impact categories still under methodological
   development, namely resource depletion, land use and land use change,
   water use, soil quality impacts and biodiversity. In addition, climate
   impacts were quantified in order to exemplify the uncertainty of the
   results and the complexity of estimating the parameters. This study
   demonstrates the difficulty to assess the absolute range of the total
   environmental impacts of the two systems. The results propose that the
   greenhouse gas emissions of microalgae biodiesel are higher than those
   of forest residue-based biodiesel, but the results of the microalgae
   chain are very uncertain due to the early development stage of the
   technology, and due to assumptions made concerning the electricity mix.
   On the other hand, the microalgae system has other advantages such as
   low competition on productive land and low biodiversity impacts. The
   findings help to recognise the main characteristics of the two
   production chains, and the main remaining research issues on bioenergy
   assessment along with the methodological development needs of life cycle
   approaches.

AB Sludge and microalgae have been reported as the main residues of
   microalgal-bacterial symbiosis wastewater treatment, characterized by
   high moisture content and large output. Effective utilization is still a
   challenging task. Aiming to find out the most optimized and applicable
   process, eight co-hydrothermal conversion schemes were investigated in
   this study. It was found that using hydrothermal carbonization as
   pretreatment of sludge, co-hydrothermal liquefaction of two raw
   materials could have 45.65% bio-oil, 5.07% more than conventional
   co-hydrothermal liquefaction with simple mixing of sludge and microalgae
   in the reactor. The acid content of bio-oil was reduced by 14.4% at the
   same time. In another improved process, all acid of bio-oil was
   eliminated when the co-hydrothermal liquefaction occurred between
   microalgae and hydrochar obtained by sludge hydrothermal carbonization.
   This is more conducive to equipment material selection and reduces the
   difficulty of upgrading. Furthermore, the mechanism of acid
   transformation was explored by the hydrothermal experiment of model
   compounds. Based on experiment data, three optimal co-hydrothermal
   liquefaction systems were evaluated through conception process
   construction and life cycle assessment. The Global Warming Potential of
   co-hydrothermal liquefaction of sludge and microalgae was 39.97 kg
   CO2eq, while the Global Warming Potential of co-hydrothermal
   liquefaction of microalgae with hydrochar obtained by sludge
   hydrothermal carbonization was only 25.49 kg CO2eq, which showed that
   sludge hydrothermal carbonization exhibited the largest environmental
   benefits. And sensitivity analysis showed that combining hydrothermal
   carbonization with co-hydrothermal liquefaction could reduce the
   influence of various environmental impact categories and improve
   environmental stability.

AB This work investigates microalgae's potential to reduce North-Western
   Europe environmental burden from excess nitrogen polluting groundwater
   and provide an environmental replacement for current animal feed. Algae
   uptake nutrients from nutrient-rich digestate from biogas plants and
   turn them into high-value feedstock, which can substitute soybean meal
   imported from overseas and avoid deforestation of rainforests. Life
   cycle assessments were conducted based on novel and original data from
   engineers in academia and industry, acquired through pilot-scale
   research facilities in the UK, France, and Belgium. The findings of this
   study highlight the environmental impacts of three different
   technologies with varying scales of production. Mixotrophic algal feed
   production shows higher productivities and fewer energy demands than the
   phototrophic systems. Still, the process is less favourable due to
   higher impacts on human health and ecosystems than imported soybean
   meal, whereas the impact on resources is more negligible. Sensitive
   analysis indicates that further technological development, increased
   productivities, and renewable energy use can improve the environmental
   competitiveness of algal feedstock. Since this process is a promising
   solution for making feedstock out of excess nutrients and having an
   alternative source for imported soybean meal with a comparable, efforts
   to realize these improvements and successfully upscaling algal feedstock
   production in combination with biogas plants are justified and can
   improve the environmental footprint of algal biomass production.

   Therefore, the integration of biofuel production with other microalgal
   applications, such as CO2 capture and nutrient removal from wastewaters,
   would reduce the microalgal production costs (and the environmental
   impact of cultures), increasing the economic viability of the whole
   process. Additionally, producing biofuels from microalgae strongly
   depends on microalgal strain and culture conditions. This study
   evaluates the effect of culture conditions, namely light irradiance (36,
   60, 120 and 180 E m-2 s-1) and light:dark ratio (10:14, 14:10 and 24:0),
   on microalgal growth, atmospheric CO2 uptake and nutrient (nitrogen and
   phosphorous) removal from culture medium. Four different microalgal
   strains, Chlorella vulgaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata,
   Synechocystis salina and Microcystis aeruginosa, were studied to
   ascertain the most advantageous regarding the referred applications.
   This study has shown that higher light irradiance values and light
   periods resulted in higher specific growth rates and CO2 uptake rates.
   C. vulgaris presented the highest specific growth rate and CO2 uptake
   rate: 1.1900.041 d-1 and 0.4710.047 gCO2 L-1 d-1, respectively. All the
   strains have shown high nitrogen removal efficiencies, reaching 100%
   removal percentages in cultures with higher light supply. Phosphorus
   removal increased with light irradiance and with light:dark ratio. The
   highest removal efficiency, 67.67.1%, was achieved by the microalga C.
   vulgaris.

AB We present a comparative environmental and social life cycle assessment
   (ELCA and SLCA) of algal fuel and fodder co-production (AF + fodder)
   versus algal fuel and energy co-production (AF + energy). Our ELCA
   results indicate that fodder co-production offers an advantage in the
   following categories: climate change (biogenic land use and land use
   change total), ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, ionizing radiation,
   photochemical ozone creation, and land use. By contrast, the AF + energy
   system yields lower impacts in the other 11 out of 19 Environmental
   Footprint impact categories. Only AF + fodder offers greenhouse gas
   reduction compared to petroleum diesel (-25%). Our SLCA results indicate
   that AF + fodder yields lower impacts in the following categories: fair
   salaries, forced labor, gender wage gap, health expenditure,
   unemployment, and violation of employment laws and regulations. AF +
   energy performs favorably in the other three out of nine social
   indicators. We conclude that the choice of co-products has a strong
   influence on the sustainability of algal fuel production. Despite this,
   none of the compared systems are found to yield a consistent advantage
   in the environmental or social dimension. It is, therefore, not possible
   to recommend a co-production strategy without weighing environmental and
   social issues.

U1 0
U2 82
AB The industrial scale production of biodiesel, the most common biofuel,
   requires innovative solutions to become more and more competitive with a
   reduced environmental impact. Microalgae are the most promising
   feedstock for biodiesel production since they are grown on non-arable
   areas and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions as well. The oil
   extraction is the competitiveness bottleneck, largely impacting the
   overall process cost. Oil extraction using ionic liquids is considered a
   promising technique, which has the chance to become a benchmark for
   large scale applications. In this paper a novel process simulation of
   ionic liquid operation is developed, implemented by Aspen Hysys V7.3.
   The chosen ionic liquid is Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, a green
   solvent; since it is a non-conventional compound, a method to compute
   its properties through a thermodynamic model is provided. Moreover, a
   process scheme has been set up and simulated, composed of a lysis
   reactor, in which the ionic liquid is added for oil extraction, and a
   three phase separator, with recycle lines and several heat exchangers
   for heat recovery. Mass and energy balances have been carried out. The
   main results allowed to calculate the recovered oil as a function of the
   ionic liquid to dry biomass weight ratio (with assuming a bio-oil
   extraction yield of 100) and as expected, the bio-oil recovery yield
   increased at decreasing temperature. However, a complete recovery is not
   feasible, due to the physical constraints in the thermodynamic model
   hypotheses. Albeit some simplifying hypotheses for the thermodynamic
   properties, the novelty of this work is that it reports results of a
   process simulation, providing indication for industrial technological
   implementation coming from a professional tool for process simulation
   and control.

AB Recent escalating concerns surrounding textile wastewater pollution and
   the urgent need for sustainable treatment solutions to mitigate its
   environmental impact. This study investigates the multifaceted effects
   of Spirulina platensis (SP) cultivation in textile wastewater from two
   different sources (TWW1 and TWW2), focusing on growth kinetics, Chemical
   Oxygen Demand (COD), and nutrient removal percentage, and seed
   germination enhancement. Results showed that SP exhibited comparable
   growth performance in TWW1 and TWW2 to the control, indicating its
   potential for sustainable wastewater treatment. Moreover, maximum COD
   removal percentages were achieved, reaching 62.59  1.88% for TWW1 and
   46.68  1.40% for TWW2 on day 5. The COD removal process aligns best with
   the first-order kinetic model. Nutrient removal rates showed decreasing
   trends over time, with maximum phosphate removal percentages of 36.42 
   0.73% for TWW1 and 62.18  1.24% for TWW2, and maximum ammonia removal
   percentages of 59.34  1.18% for TWW1 and 69.31  1.39% for TWW2. FTIR
   analysis confirmed pollutant removal-induced changes in algal biomass
   functional groups. Seed germination studies indicated enhanced shoot and
   root development of vigna radiatas using treated TWW1 and TWW2 compared
   to the control, suggesting potential applications for irrigation. An
   increase in the lipid & carbohydrate content post-treatment was observed
   and it would be suitable for biofuel production. This comprehensive
   assessment demonstrates the synergistic benefits of phycoremediation in
   simultaneously removing pollutants, promoting plant growth, and
   enhancing wastewater treatment efficiency, underscoring its potential
   for sustainable water management practices.

AB Microalgae have the potential as a source of biofuels due to their high
   biomass productivity and ability to grow in a wide range of conditions,
   including wastewater. This study investigated cultivating two microalgae
   species, Oocystis pusilla and Chlorococcus infusionum, in wastewater for
   biodiesel production. Compared to Kuhl medium, KC medium resulted in a
   significant fold increase in cellular dry weight production for both O.
   pusilla and C. infusionum, with an increase of 1.66 and 1.39,
   respectively. A concentration of 100% wastewater resulted in the highest
   growth for O. pusilla, with an increase in biomass and lipid content
   compared to the KC medium. C. infusionum could not survive in these
   conditions. For further increase in biomass and lipid yield of O.
   pusilla, different total dissolved solids (TDS) levels were used.
   Maximum biomass and lipid productivities were achieved at 3000 ppm TDS,
   resulting in a 28% increase in biomass (2.50 g/L) and a 158% increase in
   lipid yield (536.88 mg/g) compared to KC medium. The fatty acid profile
   of O. pusilla cultivated on aerated wastewater at 3000 ppm TDS showed a
   high proportion of desirable saturated fatty acids (SFA) and
   monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) for biodiesel production. Cultivating
   microalgae in wastewater for biodiesel production can be cost-effective,
   especially for microalgae adapted to harsh conditions. It could be
   concluded that O. pusilla is a promising candidate for biodiesel
   production using wastewater as a growth medium, as it has high biomass
   productivity and lipid yield, and its fatty acid profile meets the
   standard values of American and European biodiesel standards. This
   approach offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution for
   producing biofuels while reducing the environmental impact of wastewater
   disposal.

AB From a sustainability perspective, the potential risks associated with
   microalgae production for biofuel extraction will be investigated in
   this paper, including the environmental, economic, social and cultural
   dimensions. Environmentally, four main concerns are mapped out: first,
   there are potential water safety risks, such as water resource abuse,
   water pollution and groundwater recharge deficiency; second,
   unreasonable construction will lead to land-use overexpansion, land
   pollution and service expectancy reduction; third, microalgae production
   may exert a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem, causing algal
   blooms and biological invasion; finally, microalgae might emit
   unexpected greenhouse gases [nitrogen oxides (NOx), methane (CH4)] and
   ammonia (NH3). From an economic risk standpoint, microalgae production
   requires an overwhelming investment due to the expensive start-up and
   operation. Socially, contaminant discharge will threaten the health of
   local animals and people. Moreover, the safety effects of genetically
   modified algae may not be immediately apparent or known. In addition,
   over time, microalgae may become a medium for mosquitoes to spread
   disease. From a cultural point of view, it requires time for people in
   developing countries to adapt algal oil to their daily life as an
   alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, personnel changes
   in the workforce may harm existing cultural structures, and landscape
   aesthetics may be affected by system construction. Taking the above
   challenges into consideration, efficient government policies, proactive
   company behaviours and positive public participation will play an
   important role in minimising or even eliminating these potential risks.

AB Background: Enhancement of lipid accumulation is the major strategy to
   improve the commercial feasibility of microalgae as a source for
   biodiesel production.Pseudochlorella pringsheimii(Formally was named
   asChlorella ellipsoidea) green microalgae strain was chosen with respect
   to their ability as a potential source to produce high lipids content,
   could be used for the production of biofuel, which can be an alternative
   renewable energy source instead of fossil fuels. Results: Initially,
   thePseudochlorella pringsheimiimicroalgae was evaluated on the basis of
   tested at Lab scales 2 L by applicable different nutrient individual of
   N, P, Fe conditions in BBM medium concentrations for choosing the best
   concentrations induce lipid contents and productivity to cultivate in
   large scale in the 2000 L PBR. The suitable concentrations of nutrients
   with highest lipid contents were obtained under deficient of nitrogen
   (1.25 gL-1, limited N) and phosphorus (0.1 mg L-1, limited P) coupled
   with high iron concentration (10 mg L, rich Fe) and CO2(6%). Therefore,
   their collective of nutrients was applied to culture of microalgae cells
   at large scale in 2000 L photobioreactor (PBR model), which, this
   techniques was used to quantify high lipid contents (25% w/w) and high
   lipid productivity (74.07 mgL-1day-1). The inducted lipid conversion to
   biodiesel via transestrification process was 91.54  1.43%. The fatty
   acid methyl esters (FAMEs profile by means of GC/MS resulted in C16:0,
   C18:1, C18:2, C18:3) as a main constituents. With regard to
   physical-chemical property (such as density, kinematic viscosity,
   gravity, and certain number), thePseudochlorella pringsheimiibiodiesel
   have biofuel properties, in accordance with appropriate biodiesel
   properties, as ASTM and EU standards, that thereby referring to high
   quality biodiesel. Conclusions:Pseudochlorella pringsheimiicultured in
   large scale in photobioreactor under stress condition have a high
   potential of lipids production with high quality of FAMEs that can be
   used as a promising biodiesel fuel. It has also a potential to be
   applied for commercialization based on the techno-economic and
   environmental impacts.

AB Microalgae are a diverse group of organisms with significant potential
   for industrial applications: as feedstock in aquaculture as well as in
   the production of valuable bioproducts such as lipids, carotenoids and
   enzymes. Lately, developments in molecular biology have improved
   production yields of algae bioproducts, thus increasing their industrial
   relevance. Additionally, variations in bioprocessing factors (i.e.
   temperature, pH, light, carbon source, salinity, nutrients, etc.) have
   been used to enhance both biomass and specific bioproducts'
   productivities. Particularly, microalgae have increasingly gained
   research interest as a source of specialty lipids such as arachidonic,
   eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, which are often reported in
   literature to provide several health benefits. Moreover, there has been
   a recent resurgence in interest in microalgae as an oil producer for
   biofuel applications. Significant advances have also been made in
   upstream processing to generate cellular biomass and oil. However,
   extracting and purifying oil from algae continues to prove a significant
   challenge in producing both microalgae bioproducts and biofuel, as
   microbial oil extraction is relatively energy-intensive and costly.
   Thus, developing inexpensive and robust oil extraction and purification
   processes is a major challenge facing both the microalgae to bioproduct,
   and biofuel industries. This paper presents an overview, based on the
   last 10 years, of advances made in technologies for extracting and
   purifying microalgae oil. We compared solvent extraction technologies
   with extraction alternatives such as mechanical milling and pressing,
   enzymatic and supercritical fluid extraction. We also reviewed recent

TI A review on bio-lubricant production from non-edible oil-bearing biomass
   resources in Iran: recent progress and perspectives.

AB Lubricants are among the largest drivers of global oil demand in the
   world. The negative environmental impacts resulting from the entry of
   direct mineral lubricants necessitates the application of bio-lubricants
   as an excellent alternative to mineral lubricants. The main resources of
   bio-lubricants are edible/non-edible oils. The use of edible oils as the
   primary feedstock for bio-lubricant production in developing countries
   like Iran is being faced with several controversial challenges including
   the high dependence of the country to edible oils import, the high price
   of edible oils, the crisis of food shortage, and the negative impact of
   edible oils on energy security. The application of non-edible oils as a
   sustainable bio-lubricant resource plays a critical role in lubricant
   industries. This review provides an overview on bio-lubricant production
   with a description of various kinds of non-edible feedstocks. A detailed
   description of different non-edible resources in Iran (e.i. castor,
   jatropha, microalgae, waste oil/fat, bitter almond, ailanthus, camelina,
   and waste fish oil) including the characterization, distribution,
   climate, and quality analysis are presented. Various kinds of chemical
   modification methods focused on improving the quality of bio-lubricants
   have been also discussed. This review delivers a comprehensive overview
   of bio-lubricant synthesis by discussing applications, recent trends,
   and challenges in this field. The information provided in this study can
   be of assistance with the researchers and experts involved in the
   lubricant industry take an effective step to address the challenges
   ahead in the cleaner lubricants production by relying on sustainable
   oily resources.

AB Algae have contributed greatly to the creation of the Earth's
   environment and the development of human civilization. Currently,
   microalgae are considered to be among the most promising sources for
   biofuel. Most microalgae accumulate triacylglycerols; however, fatty
   acid methyl esters produced from triacylglycerols by transesterification
   have critical end-use issues. Hydrocarbons produced
   byBotryococcusandAurantiochytriumare the most suitable algal oils for
   replacing existing transportation fuels and are highly compatible with
   existing petroleum infrastructure. Over the years, many technologies
   have been investigated for achieving sustainable biofuel production
   using oleaginous microalgae; however, existing techniques of algal fuel
   production are suitable mainly for small-scale procedures or for the
   recovery or removal of high-value products. This situation strongly
   influences life cycle assessment studies for algal fuel production, and
   published life cycle assessments show different and discrepant results -
   reliable data on inputs and outputs from industrial-scale experiments
   are needed for solving these problems. The estimated cost of algal fuel
   production is still high compared with that of fossil crude oils. The
   integration of water treatment and algal biomass production, in a
   coupled hybrid production system comprising of phototrophic and
   heterotrophic algae, has tremendous potential for improving the economy
   of future algal fuels.

AB The algal biofuel technology has been accelerated greatly during the
   last decade. Microalgae can be processed into a broad spectrum of
   biofuel precursors, which mainly include crude algal oil recovered by
   extraction and bio-crude oils produced from hydrothermal liquefaction
   and pyrolysis processes. Due to the high protein content in algal
   species and the limitations of conversion technologies, these biofuel
   precursors require the further catalytic removal of heteroatoms such as
   oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, being upgraded to biofuels like green
   diesel and aviation fuel. This article reviews the state-of-the-art in
   the hydroprocessing of microalgae-based biofuels, as well as the
   catalyst development and the effect of process parameters on
   hydrotreated algal fuels. Hydroprocessing of algal fuels is a new and
   challenging task, and still underdeveloped. For the long term, an ideal
   catalyst for this process should possess the following characteristics:
   high activities towards deoxygenation and denitrogenation, strong
   resistance to poisons, minimized leaching problems and coke formation,
   and an economically sound preparation process.

AB In recent years, the world energy demands have had a recurrent increase.
   For this reason the alternative to the fossil fuel resources are trend
   topics in investigation. Microalgae have been extensively studied as a
   source of biofuels and as one of the most promising alternatives in this
   new framework. One of the possibilities of obtaining renewable energy
   from microalgae is biogas production using anaerobic digestion process.
   This process is considered a significant component for biofuels and
   waste management, since represent an opportunity for energy generation
   using different wastewater products; also, the economic viability of
   microalgae liquid biofuel production could be improved. However, the
   anaerobic digestion of microalgae biomass is still not optimized because
   of the numerous technical limitations such as the microalgae
   characteristics, low carbon:nitrogen ratio, ammonia toxicity and even
   salinity. The present review summarizes and compares information
   concerning to anaerobic digestion of microalgal biomass and future
   directions for research. Besides, specific operational factors and
   potential inhibitory parameters of the process are analyzed and
   compared. Additionally, the paper covers the state or art concerning in
   methane production enhancement from algal biomass.

AB Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is recognized as a
   potential negative emission technology, needed to keep global warming
   within safe limits. With current technologies, large-scale
   implementation of BECCS would compromise food production. Bioenergy
   derived from phototrophic microorganisms, with direct capture of CO2
   from air, could overcome this challenge and become a sustainable way to
   realize BECCS. Here we present an alkaline capture and conversion system
   that combines high atmospheric CO2 transfer rates with high and robust
   phototrophic biomass productivity (15.2  1.0 g/m2/d). The system is
   based on a cyanobacterial consortium, that grows at high alkalinity (0.5
   mol/L) and a pH swing between 10.4 and 11.2 during growth and harvest
   cycles.

AB Considering the high- and low-value product perspectives, Arthrospira
   spp. are one of the most industrially exploited microalgae. However,
   currently, the biomass is being utilized for one specific product
   resulting in a steep upsurge in the overall production cost. Hence, to

   high- and low-value products from it ought to be valorized. Envisioning
   how costlier can be the multiproduct biorefinery concept owing to the
   downstream processing at an industrial scale, it is quite essential to
   look for new trends and encouraging solutions. This article intended to
   propose a sustainable biorefinery in the wake of the current
   understanding of the present constraints and challenges associated with
   Arthrospira biorefinery. The current review aimed at defining the future
   aspects of this biorefinery including integration and optimization of

AB High-rate algal ponds (HRAPs) are a highly promoted wastewater treatment
   system that uses sunlight as an energy source to provide the oxygen
   needed in the system through photosynthesis and has a high nutrient and
   organic matter removal capacity. In addition, the microalgae in the
   system can use wastewater as a growth substrate to produce valuable
   bioproducts, biomaterials, and bioenergy, so it is receiving more and
   more attention. This review uses bibliometric analysis to explore
   current research hotspots and future research trends in this emerging
   technology. By analyzing research papers related to HRAPs published in
   the Web of Science (WOS) from 1987 to 2021 based on the co-occurrence
   and clustering of keywords, it shows that the research hotspots of HRAPs
   are mainly focused on wastewater treatment, nutrient removal, microalgal
   biomass, biofuel, and biogas upgrading. In the future, in-depth research
   will continue to be added on the contribution of HRAPs to environmental
   sustainability, includingE. coliremoval, biogas upgrading and oxygen
   removal, treatment of aquaculture wastewater, purple phototrophic
   bacteria, aqueous biorefineries, and biorefineries. The results assist
   scholars in systematically understanding the current research status,

AB Competition for arable land between food and energy producers has begun
   in Latvia. Biogas producers are seeking to use the hitherto unused land.
   There is a need to investigate the suitability of various biomasses for
   energy production. Maize is the dominating crop for biogas production in
   Latvia, but it is expensive to grow. The cultivation of more varied
   biomass with good economics and low environmental impact is thus
   desirable. Microalgae can be grown in pipes, basins and also in open
   ponds. This paper shows the results from the anaerobic digestion of
   microalgaeChlorella vulgaris, cultivated with fertilizer Varicon in open
   pond and harvested on 27 October and centrifuged (Study 1). The
   anaerobic digestion process was investigated for biogas production in
   sixteen 0.75 l digesters, operated in batch mode at temperature 381.0°C.
   The average methane yield per unit of dry organic matter added (DOM)
   from digestion ofChlorella vulgariswas 0.331 l gDOM-1. The second
   investigation (Study 2) used fresh biomass ofChlorella vulgarisharvested
   on 10-15 June with low dry matter content, as it was obtained from 4 m
   deep open pond without centrifugation. Anaerobic digestion process was
   provided in 4 digesters with volume of 5 l each. Average methane yield
   from the digestion ofChlorella vulgariswas 0.290 l gDOM-1, which is
   comparable to methane yield obtainable from maize silage or other energy
   crop silages. MicroalgaeChlorella vulgariscan be successfully cultivated
   for biogas production from May to October or at least 170-180 days in a
   year under the agro-ecological conditions in Latvia.

   cell disruption and extraction are effective but time consuming and
   could be detrimental to the environment. Hence, different innovative
   cell disruption techniques such as microwave-assisted extraction are
   developed to overcome these issues. This paper is a review of
   traditional and microwave-assisted extraction methods that are used for
   lipid extraction from microalgae biomass. The advantages, challenges and
   future trends of microwave-assisted extraction are also discussed.

AB Microalgal biotechnology could generate substantial amounts of biofuels
   with minimal environmental impact if the economics can be improved by
   increasing the rate of biomass production. Chlorella kessleri was grown
   in a small-scale raceway pond and in flask cultures with the entire
   volume, 1% (v/v) at any instant, periodically exposed to static magnetic
   fields to demonstrate increased biomass production and investigate
   physiological changes, respectively. The growth rate in flasks was
   maximal at a field strength of 10 mT, increasing from 0.390.06 per day
   for the control to 0.880.06 per day. In the raceway pond the 10 mT field
   increased the growth rate from 0.240.03 to 0.450.05 per day, final
   biomass from 0.880.11 to 1.560.18 g/L per day, and maximum biomass
   production from 0.110.02 to 0.380.04 g/L per day. Increased pigment,
   protein, Ca, and Zn content made the biomass produced with magnetic
   stimulation nutritionally superior. An increase in oxidative stress was
   measured indirectly as a decrease in antioxidant capacity from 262 to
   171 mol antioxidant/g biomass. Net photosynthetic capacity (NPC) and
   respiratory rate were increased by factors of 2.1 and 3.1, respectively.
   Loss of NPC enhancement after the removal of magnetic field fit a
   first-order model well (R2=0.99) with a half-life of 3.3 days.
   Transmission electron microscopy showed enlarged chloroplasts and
   decreased thylakoid order with 10 mT treatment. By increasing daily
   biomass production about fourfold, 10 mT magnetic field exposure could
   make algal oil cost competitive with other biodiesel feedstocks.

U1 10
U2 93
AB Recent advances in microalgae to biohythane (bio-H2and bio-CH4)
   conversion have achieved growing attention due to their eco-friendly and
   energy-efficient nature. Although microalgae are considered a potential
   3rd - 4th generation biomass, their low C/N ratio and cell-wall
   biopolymers are challenging for biohythane production. This study
   emphasizes the solutions to mitigate the adverse effects of
   microalgae-based biohythane production using co-digestion with
   wastewater sludge. Wastewater sludge, an emerging environmental concern,
   is reviewed to be an effective co-substrate with microalgae to establish
   a biorefinery approach. The future trends and prospects of this
   biorefinery approach is critically reviewed to attain a profitable
   process. This study also reviewed the advantages of
   microalgae-wastewater co-cultivation and the application of activated
   sludge for bio-flocculation as a cost-effective solution for microalgae
   cultivation and harvesting. Microalgae-wastewater co-cultivation is also
   recommended to be effective for biohythane purification. The liquid
   digestate is suggested to be used as a culture media to enhance
   microalgal growth; whereas, the solid digestate could be transformed
   into resources through hydrothermal processes as a solution of digestate
   management. A practical biorefinery approach combining the synergistic
   benefits of microalgae-wastewater sludge and its biological conversion
   to biohythane would be an adjoining link to the beginning of a
   sustainable future.

TI Microalgae-based livestock wastewater treatment (MbWT) as a circular
   bioeconomy approach: enhancement of biomass productivity, pollutant
   removal and high-value compound production.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 308
PY 2022
U1 62
U2 366
AB The intensive livestock activities that are carried out worldwide to
   feed the growing human population have led to significant environmental
   problems, such as soil degradation, surface and groundwater pollution.
   Livestock wastewater (LW) contains high loads of organic matter,
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). These compounds can promote cultural
   eutrophication of water bodies and pose environmental and human hazards.
   Therefore, humanity faces an enormous challenge to adequately treat LW
   and avoid the overexploitation of natural resources. This can be
   accomplished through circular bioeconomy approaches, which aim to
   achieve sustainable production using biological resources, such as LW,
   as feedstock. Circular bioeconomy uses innovative processes to produce
   biomaterials and bioenergy, while lowering the consumption of virgin
   resources. Microalgae-based wastewater treatment (MbWT) has recently
   received special attention due to its low energy demand, the robust
   capacity of microalgae to grow under different environmental conditions
   and the possibility to recover and transform wastewater nutrients into
   highly valuable bioactive compounds. Some of the high-value products
   that may be obtained through MbWT are biomass and pigments for human
   food and animal feed, nutraceuticals, biofuels, polyunsaturated fatty
   acids, carotenoids, phycobiliproteins and fertilizers. This article
   reviews recent advances in MbWT of LW (including swine, cattle and
   poultry wastewater). Additionally, the most significant factors
   affecting nutrient removal and biomass productivity in MbWT are
   addressed, including: (1) microbiological aspects, such as the
   microalgae strain used for MbWT and the interactions between microbial
   populations; (2) physical parameters, such as temperature, light
   intensity and photoperiods; and (3) chemical parameters, such as the C/N
   ratio, pH and the presence of inhibitory compounds. Finally, different
   strategies to enhance nutrient removal and biomass productivity, such as
   acclimation, UV mutagenesis and multiple microalgae culture stages
   (including monocultures and multicultures) are discussed.

U1 1
U2 90
AB Research on biofuel production pathways from algae continues because
   among other potential advantages they avoid key consequential effects of
   terrestrial oil crops, such as competition for cropland. However, the
   economics, energetic balance, and climate change emissions from algal
   biofuels pathways do not always show great potential, due in part to
   high fertilizer demand. Nutrient recycling from algal biomass residue is
   likely to be essential for reducing the environmental impacts and cost
   associated with algae-derived fuels. After a review of available
   technologies, anaerobic digestion (AD) and hydrothermal liquefaction
   (HTL) were selected and compared on their nutrient recycling and energy
   recovery potential for lipid-extracted algal biomass using the
   microalgae strainScenedesmus dimorphus. For 1 kg (dry weight) of algae
   cultivated in an open raceway pond, 40.7 g N and 3.8 g P can be recycled
   through AD, while 26.0 g N and 6.8 g P can be recycled through HTL. In
   terms of energy production, 2.49 MJ heat and 2.61 MJ electricity are
   generated from AD biogas combustion to meet production system demands,
   while 3.30 MJ heat and 0.95 MJ electricity from HTL products are
   generated and used within the production system. Assuming recycled
   nutrient products from AD or HTL technologies displace demand for
   synthetic fertilizers, and energy products displace natural gas and
   electricity, the life cycle greenhouse gas reduction achieved by adding
   AD to the simulated algal oil production system is between 622 and 808 g
   carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)/kg biomass depending on substitution
   assumptions, while the life cycle GHG reduction achieved by HTL is
   between 513 and 535 g CO2e/kg biomass depending on substitution
   assumptions. Based on the effectiveness of nutrient recycling and energy
   recovery, as well as technology maturity, AD appears to perform better
   than HTL as a nutrient and energy recycling technology in algae oil
   production systems.

AB Bioenergy is known as green energy produced from organic biomass, such
   as food leftovers, non-edible agri-residues, and municipal wastes
   through biotic and abiotic methods. Globally, generation of the most
   common renewable fuels including biohydrogen (bioH2), biogas,
   bioethanol, biofertilizers and bio plastics as fossil fuel substitutes
   by means of circular bioeconomy is gaining tremendous focus in support
   of environmental concerns. Carbon free bioH2is considered as deemed fuel
   due to its multifaceted applications and potent ecological features. As
   the present commercial energy manufacturing methods tap on non-renewable
   fuels and associated high cost, there is an immediate need for full
   scale sustainable bioH2production systems in accordance with regional
   demand through domestic innovations. Though, research on hydrogen
   production is not less common via conventional thermo chemical methods,
   it is essential to understand much regarding biological methods to
   achieve feasible transition from depleting fossil fuels to eco-friendly
   renewable energy. Thus, this review primarily focuses on different
   sustainable approaches for lignocellulosic biomass valorization towards
   bioH2production along with potential thermo chemical approaches. In
   particular, bioH2production from lignocellulosic biomass in the presence
   and absence of light by photo fermentation and dark fermentation,
   respectively, reactor configuration, importance of biocatalyst
   pretreatment and potential methods, and natural and mutant microalgal
   bioH2evolution have been discussed in detail to address their industrial
   level applicability.

   Cyanobacteria possess a number of features that make them well suited as
   an alternative feedstock crop in comparison to traditional terrestrial

AB The use of fossil-based products induces a large environmental burden.
   To lighten this burden, green technologies are required that can replace
   their fossil-based counterparts. To enable the development of
   economically viable green technologies, an optimization towards both
   economic and environmental objectives is required. To perform this
   multi-objective optimization (MOO), the environmental techno-economic
   assessment (ETEA) methodology is extended towards a MOO-extended ETEA.
   The development of this MOO-extended ETEA is the main objective of this
   manuscript. As an example of a green technology, the concept of
   microalgae biorefineries is used as a case study to illustrate the
   MOO-extended ETEA. According to the results, all optimal value chains
   include open pond cultivation, a membrane for medium recycling and spray
   drying. The optimal economic value chain usesNannochloropsissp. in a
   one-stage cultivation to produce fish larvae feed, while the optimal
   environmental design usesDunaliella salinaorHaematococcus pluvialisto
   produce carotenoids and fertilizer or energy products, by means of
   anaerobic digestion or gasification. The crucial parameters for both
   environmental and economic feasibility are the content, price and
   reference impact of the main end product, the growth parameters and the
   biomass and carotenoid recovery efficiency alongside the different
   process steps. By identifying the economic and environmentally optimal
   algal-based value chain and the crucial drivers, the MOO-extended ETEA
   provides insights on how algae-based value chains can be developed in
   the most economic and environmentally-friendly way. For example, the
   inclusion of a medium recycling step to lower the water and salt
   consumption is required in all Pareto-optimal scenarios. Another major
   insight is the requirement of high-value products such as carotenoids or
   specialty food to obtain and economically and environmentally feasible
   algal-based value chain. Due to the modular nature of the MOO-extended
   ETEA, multiple processes can be included or excluded from the
   superstructure. Although this case study is limited to current
   microalgae biorefinery technologies, the MOO-extended ETEA can also be
   used to assess the economic and environmental effect of more innovative
   technologies. This way, the MOO-extended ETEA provides a methodology to
   assess the economic and environmental potential of innovative green
   technologies and shorten their time-to-market.

AB The development of new technologies for production of alternative fuel
   became necessary to circumvent finite petroleum resources, associate
   rising costs, and environmental concerns due to rising fossil fuel
   CO2emissions. Several alternatives have been proposed to develop a
   sustainable industrial society and reduce greenhouse emissions. The idea
   of biological conversion of CO2to fuel and chemicals is receiving
   increased attention. In particular, the direct conversion of CO2with
   solar energy to biofuel by photosynthetic microorganisms such as
   microalgae and cyanobacteria has several advantages compared to
   traditional biofuel production from plant biomass. Photosynthetic
   microorganisms have higher growth rates compared with plants, and the
   production systems can be based on non-arable land. The advancement of
   synthetic biology and genetic manipulation has permitted engineering of
   cyanobacteria to produce non-natural chemicals typically not produced by
   these organisms in nature. This review addresses recent publications
   that utilize different approaches involving engineering cyanobacteria
   for production of high value chemicals including biofuels.

AB With the increasing global demand for energy, renewable and sustainable
   biogas has attracted considerable attention. However, the presence of
   various gases such as methane, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen, and
   hydrogen sulfide in biogas, and the potential emission of acid gases,
   which may adversely influence the environment, limits the efficient
   application of biogas in many fields. Consequently, researchers have
   focused on the upgrade and purification of biogas to eliminate
   impurities and obtain high-quality and high-purity biomethane with an
   increased combustion efficiency. In this context, the removal of CO2gas,
   which is the most abundant contaminant in biogas, is of significance.
   Compared to conventional biogas purification processes such as water
   scrubbing, chemical absorption, pressure swing adsorption, and cryogenic
   separation, advanced membrane separation technologies are simpler to
   implement, easier to scale, and incur lower costs. Notably, hollow fiber
   membranes enhance the gas separation efficiency and decrease costs
   because their large specific surface area provides a greater range of
   gas transport. Several reviews have described biogas upgrading
   technologies and gas separation membranes composed of different
   materials. In this review, five commonly used commercial biogas
   upgrading technologies, as well as biological microalgae-based
   techniques are compared, the advantages and limitations of polymeric and
   mixed matrix hollow fiber membranes are highlighted, and methods to
   fabricate and modify hollow fiber membranes are described. This will
   provide more ideas and methods for future low-cost, large-scale
   industrial biogas upgrading using membrane technology.

AB It is anticipated that achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement goals
   will require widespread deployment of negative emission technologies
   (NETs). The most prominent NET is bioenergy with carbon capture and
   storage (BECCS), which is typically envisioned to use terrestrial crops
   as feedstock. Several recent studies have focused on aquatic BECCS
   (A-BECCS), making use of microalgae or macroalgae as feedstock, as
   possible means of reducing water and land use. However, the high
   logistical complexity of the A-BECCS supply chain makes it likely that
   regional biophysical and socio-technical factors will strongly influence
   its overall favorability. Therefore, this study applies life-cycle
   assessment (LCA) incorporating a geographic information system (GIS)
   framework to estimate the environmental impacts of A-BECCS over all
   stages of its life-cycle. Three candidate locations in the USA are
   evaluated based on seemingly good proximity to coastal regions and CO2
   storage; namely, East Coast, West Coast, and the Gulf of Mexico. Monte
   Carlo simulation is used to characterize distributions of model outputs,
   including energy return on investment (EROI) and net global warming
   potential (GWP). Results reveal that only the Gulf of Mexico
   configuration has any likelihood of achieving both net energy production
   (probability of EROI > 1 = 29%) and net CO2 sequestration (probability
   of GWP < 0 = 6%), but the probability of achieving both together is very
   low (5%). The other two locations exhibit net positive energy production
   (EROI > 1), but not net negative carbon sequestration. These results
   call into question the feasibility of the modeled A-BECCS system as an
   energy-producing NET and offer insights into possible system
   reconfiguration. For example, anaerobic digestion offers very low EROI
   and creates multiple carbon-bearing waste streams, which strongly
   undercuts overall net CO2 sequestration. Finally, it is observed that
   enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strongly contributes to net-energy
   production (EROI > 1) in the modeled A-BECCS system, but also strongly
   undercuts net CO2 sequestration, which is arguably the main goal of any
   NET. This analysis showcases how geographically-explicit analysis can
   advance our understanding of biomass-based NETs.

AB Bioenergy sources are promising alternatives for sustainable energy
   production. Nevertheless, significant research and detailed analysis are
   necessary to identify the circumstances under which such energy sources
   can contribute to sustainability. This paper reviews the literature of
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of microalgae-to-energy technologies and
   focuses in two categories, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and Net Energy
   Ratios (NER). The analysis is illustrated with a case study of
   microalgae biomass combustion to produce heat and compares the influence
   of different electricity sources with respect to GHG emissions and NER
   along the supply chain. Selected fossil energy sources were used as
   reference conditions. The methodology was LCA based on ISO 14044
   standard, and most of the data used were extracted from a review of
   relevant scientific publications. Heat production from microalgae showed
   higher GHG emissions than those from fossil fuels with United States'
   electricity grid, but lower than those with the Brazilian one. The NER
   of heat from microalgae combustion life cycle is still disadvantageous
   compared to most of fossil options. However, the observation that fossil
   fuel options performed slightly better than microalgae combustion, in
   the two categories analyzed, must be understood in the context of a
   mature fossil energy technology chain. The fossil technology has less
   potential for improvements, while microalgae technology is beginning and
   has significant potential for additional innovations.

AB To improve bioenergy production from photosynthetic microorganisms it is
   necessary to optimize an extensive network of highly integrated
   biological processes. Systematic advances in pathway engineering and
   culture modification have resulted in strains with increased yields of
   biohydrogen, lipids, and carbohydrates, three bioenergy foci. However,
   additional improvements in photosynthetic efficiency are necessary to
   establish a viable system for biofuel production. Advances in optimizing
   light capture, energy transfer, and carbon fixation are essential, as
   the efficiencies of these processes are the principal determinants of
   productivity. However, owing to their regulatory, catalytic, and
   structural complexities, manipulating these pathways poses considerable
   challenges. This review covers novel developments in the optimization of
   photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and metabolic pathways for the
   synthesis of targeted bioenergy carriers.

AB Microalgae are diverse microorganisms inhabiting a wide range of
   habitats with only a small fraction being cultivated for human use.
   Recently, interest in microalgal research has increased in the quest for
   alternative renewable fuels due to possible depletion of fossil fuels in
   the near future. However, costly downstream processing has hampered the
   commercialization of biofuels derived from microalgae. Several value
   added products of industrial, pharmaceutical and agricultural relevance
   could be simultaneously derived from microalgae during bioenergy
   production. Despite these value-added products having the potential to
   offset the high cost of downstream processing of renewable fuels, their
   production has not been explored in-depth. This review presents a
   critical overview of the current state of biotechnological applications
   of microalgae for human benefit and highlights possible areas for
   further research and development.

AB Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic microorganisms which can be
   engineered to directly convert CO2 and water into biofuels and chemicals
   via photosynthesis using sunlight as energy. However, the product titers
   and rates are the main challenges that need to be overcome for
   industrial applications. Here we present systematic modular engineering
   of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803, enabling efficient
   biosynthesis of 1-butanol, an attractive commodity chemical and gasoline
   substitute. Through introducing and re-casting the 1-butanol
   biosynthetic pathway at the gene and enzyme levels, optimizing the
   5'-regions of expression units for tuning transcription and translation,
   rewiring the carbon flux and rewriting the photosynthetic central carbon
   metabolism to enhance the precursor supply, and performing process
   development, we were able to reach a cumulative 1-butanol titer of 4.8 g
   L-1 with a maximal rate of 302 mg L-1 day-1 from the engineered
   Synechocystis. This represents the highest 1-butanol production from CO2
   reported so far. Our multi-level modular strategy for high-level
   production of chemicals and advanced biofuels represents a blue-print
   for future systematic engineering in photosynthetic microorganisms.

AB Microalgae-based renewable fuels offer low carbon alternatives to fossil
   fuels, and can theoretically support energy and climate security,
   regional employment and sustainable development. However, to achieve
   price parity with fossil fuels and fast track scale up, a benchmark
   production price of US$0.67 L-1($2.54 gal-1) must be achieved. The
   financial performance of microalgae systems can be enhanced through the
   cascaded conversion of biomass into multiple co-products, such as
   proteins and high-density liquid fuels. Here we evaluate the use of
   hydrothermal pre-treatment (HTP: 180°C, 1 MPa, 10 min) green
   chemical-based protein extraction processes (acetone and urea treatment)
   followed by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) crude oil production and
   high-density liquid fuel refining. This experimental data was
   incorporated into an integrated Techno-Economic and Life-Cycle Analysis
   (TELCA 2.1) simulation of a 500 ha microalgae production and biorefinery
   facility to simulate protein and fuel co-production at scale. At a
   minimum diesel selling price of US$0.67 L-1the protein co-product (32%
   purity) required a minimum selling price of US$7.2 kg-1. The low protein
   purity can be improved to at least 40% using low carbohydrate biomass
   and further process optimisation to deliver a more sustainable
   alternative to cheap protein sources, such as soybean meal or fishmeal.
   Competitive and green co-production of fuel and food/feed will help
   achieve a circular bioeconomy and support UN Sustainable Development
   Goals.

AB As one of the fastest-growing carbon emission sources, the aviation
   sector is severely restricted by carbon emission reduction targets.
   Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most potential
   alternative to traditional aviation fuel, but harsh production
   technologies limit its commercialization. Fatty acids photodecarboxylase
   from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP), the latest discovered
   photoenzyme, provides promising approaches to produce various
   carbon-neutral biofuels and fine chemicals. This review highlights the
   state-of-the-art strategies to enhance the application of CvFAP in
   carbon-neutral biofuel and fine chemicals production, including
   supplementing alkane as decoy molecular, screening efficient CvFAP
   variants with directed evolution, constructing genetic strains,
   employing biphasic catalytic system, and immobilizing CvFAP in an
   efficient photobioreactor. Furthermore, future opportunities are
   suggested to enhance photoenzymatic decarboxylation and explore the
   catalytic mechanism of CvFAP. This review provides a broad context to
   improve CvFAP catalysis and advance its potential applications.

AB Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms which can be found in

   considered as promising feedstock for the production of the third- and
   the fourth-generation biofuels. The main subject of this review is
   highlighting the significant aspects of the biofuel production from
   cyanobacteria. The most recent investigations about the extraction or
   separation of the bio-oil from cyanobacteria are also adduced in the
   present review. Moreover, the genetic engineering of cyanobacteria for
   improving biofuel production and the impact of bioinformatics studies on
   the designing better-engineered strains are mentioned. The large-scale
   biofuel production is challenging, so the economic considerations to
   provide inexpensive biofuels are also cited. It seems that the future of
   biofuels is strongly dependent to the following items; understanding the
   metabolic pathways of the cyanobacterial species, progression in the
   construction of the engineered cyanobacteria, and inexpensive
   large-scale cultivation of them.

   fitness are reviewed with an emphasis on physiological improvements for
   large-scale production. Lastly, a future outlook on engineered
   cyanobacteria is presented, highlighting the future areas of focus and
   technical challenges in this field. With the uncertainty of future
   energy security, it is an exciting time in applied cyanobacterial
   research, but we must take the time to learn from these past
   accomplishments before we can capitalize on the potential of these

AB Several forms of energy, such as hydrogen gas, butanol, biogas, and
   ethanol can be produced from renewable, biological resources. However,
   many bioenergy technologies are currently at the lab scale and the list
   of commercial operations successfully producing bioenergy in Canada is
   much shorter. Currently, Canada's bioenergy production is dominated by
   biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, biomass for combustion and the
   use of anaerobic digesters for biogas production. Bioenergy production
   in Canada is relatively new, especially in comparison to other renewable
   energy technologies like hydroelectricity, and therefore opportunities
   exist to improve bioenergy's economic and environmental impact. One
   route for improvement is through the valorization of co-products, and
   our efforts to use fungi to convert biodiesel wastewater and biodiesel
   derived crude glycerol to the value-added product single cell oil is
   reviewed. Wastewater is generated during biodiesel production through
   water washing of the unfinished biodiesel, and COD values for biodiesel
   wastewater are reported to range from approximately 31,000 to 590,000 mg
   L-1. Glycerol is generated in biodiesel production during the
   transesterification reaction of intact triacylglycerol molecules with an
   alcohol and a strong base. This glycerol is a crude co-product, and can
   contain high levels of methanol, residual oils and water. Cultivation of
   the newly described oleaginous fungusGalactomyces geotrichumin 50 g
   L-1crude glycerol, 10 g L-1casein and 200 mL L-1biodiesel wastewater
   yielded fungal biomass with an average single cell oil content of 51.1%.
   We also review our data on the use of microalgaNannochloropsis
   granulataas a feedstock for anaerobic digestion. This work was completed
   in a 2.2 m3pilot anaerobic digester and is unique as it is much larger
   in scope than the vast majority of literature sources reporting on the
   use of algae in anaerobic digestion applications. The use ofN.
   granulataas a co-digestion substrate with swine manure reduced the
   methane yield as compared to swine manure alone. Algal biomass added at
   0.5 kg volatile solids per day, 1.1 kg volatile solids per day and 1.6
   kg volatile solids per day reduced methane yield by 48.4%, 55.9% and
   64.7% respectively. The observed reductions may have been due to
   inhibitory metabolites produced during algal digestion or because of
   recalcitrance of the algal cell wall. The digester inoculum was not
   pre-adapted to microalgae degradation and this may have also played a
   role. Use of algal biomass as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion is
   still in its infancy, and biomass pre-treatments, different algal
   strains or different digestion techniques could be needed for the
   successful utilization of algae. Microalgae have other positive
   attributes including the ability to remediate waste streams and recycle
   nutrients as well act as a single source for multiple products and more
   research is needed in order to successfully exploit this versatile
   feedstock.

AB Photobiological hydrogen production has advanced significantly in recent
   years, and on the way to becoming a mature technology. A variety of
   photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic microorganisms, including
   unicellular green algae, cyanobacteria, anoxygenic photosynthetic
   bacteria, obligate anaerobic, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are endowed
   with genes and proteins for H2-production. Enzymes, mechanisms, and the
   underlying biochemistry may vary among these systems; however, they are
   all promising catalysts in hydrogen production. Integration of hydrogen
   production among these organisms and enzymatic systems is a recent
   concept and a rather interesting development in the field, as it may
   minimize feedstock utilization and lower the associated costs, while
   improving yields of hydrogen production. Photobioreactor development and
   genetic manipulation of the hydrogen-producing microorganisms is also
   outlined in this review, as these contribute to improvement in the yield
   of the respective processes.

AB Use of fossil fuels causes environmental issues due to its inefficiency
   and and imminent depletion. This has led to interest in identifying
   alternative and renewable energy sources such as biofuel generation from
   photosynthetic organisms. A wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
   microorganisms, known as microalgae, have the potential to be economical
   and ecologically sustainable in the manufacture of biofuels such as
   bio-hydrogen, biodiesel, bio-oils, and bio-syngas. By using contemporary
   bioengineering techniques, the innate potential of algae to produce
   biomass of superior quality may be enhanced. In algal biotechnology,
   directed genome modification via RNA-guided endonucleases is a new
   approach. CRISPR/Cas systems have recently been frequently used to
   modify the genetic makeup of several aquatic and freshwater microalgae.
   The majority of research has used the Cas9-driven Type II system, one of
   two classes and six unique kinds of CRISPR systems, to specifically
   target desired genes in algae, and knock them out and down, or both.
   Using CRISPR technology to modify its genetic makeup, microalgae has
   produced more biomass and increased in lipid content. This review
   highlights the attempts made so far to target microalgae genome
   modification, discusses the prospects for developing the CRISPR platform
   for large-scale genome modification of microalgae, and identifies the
   opportunities and challenges in the development and distribution of
   CRISPR/Cas9 components.

AB Biofuels derived from algal energy carriers, including lipids, starch
   and hydrogen, offer a promising, renewable alternative to fossil fuels.
   Unfortunately, native algal metabolisms are not optimized for the
   accumulation of these renewable bioenergy carriers. Systems biology,
   which includes genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and
   lipidomics, can inform and provide key insights to advance algal strain
   development for biotechnological applications. Recent advances in
   analytical technologies have enabled these sophisticated,
   high-throughput, holistic 'omics' techniques to generate highly accurate
   and quantitative datasets that can be leveraged to improve biofuel
   phenotypes in phototrophic microorganisms. The study of algal genomes
   and transcriptomes allows for the identification of genes, metabolic
   pathways and regulatory networks. Investigations of algal proteomes
   reveal protein levels, locations and post-translational modifications,
   while study of the metabolome reveals metabolite fluxes and
   intermediates. All of these systems-biology tools are integral for
   investigating algal metabolism from the whole-cell perspective. This
   review focuses on how systems biology has been applied to studying
   metabolic networks in algae and cyanobacteria, and how these
   technologies can be used to improve bioenergy-carrier accumulation.

AB Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms with the potential to
   mitigate the atmospheric greenhouse effect by carbon fixation. However,
   their growth is typically limited by light availability. A wavelength
   converter utilizing red, blue, and green quantum dots (QDs) was
   developed to optimize light quality for enhancing microalgal production.
   The growth, lipid content, and eicosapentaenoic acid titer of
   Nannochloropsis increased by 11.2%, 9.5%, and 15.5% with red QDs,
   respectively. The biomass and triacylglycerol content of Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum increased by 8.6% and 35.0%, respectively. Simultaneously,
   biodiesel production was accelerated in Nannochloropsis (20.2%) and P.
   tricornutum (11.6%), and improved with increased cetane number and
   reduced iodine value. Furthermore, red QDs increased the growth and
   biomass accumulation of Nannochloropsis under low light, while green QDs
   shielded Nannochloropsis from photoinhibition under high light. This
   customizable QD-based methodology overcomes microalgal light
   limitations, demonstrating a universally applicable approach to improve
   microalgal cultivation and biochemical component production.

AB Exploration of renewable energy sources is an imperative task in order
   to replace fossil fuels and to diminish atmospheric pollution. Hydrogen
   is considered one of the most promising fuels for the future and
   implores further investigation to find eco-friendly ways toward viable
   production. Expansive processes like electrolysis and fossil fuels are
   currently being used to produce hydrogen. Biological hydrogen production
   (BHP) displays recyclable and economical traits, and is thus imperative
   for hydrogen economy. Three basic modes of BHP were investigated,
   including bio photolysis, photo fermentation and dark fermentation.
   Photosynthetic microorganisms could readily serve as powerhouses to
   successively produce this type of energy. Cyanobacteria, blue green
   algae (bio photolysis) and some purple non-sulfur bacteria (Photo
   fermentation) utilize solar energy and produce hydrogen during their
   metabolic processes. Ionic species, including hydrogen (H+) and
   electrons (e-) are combined into hydrogen gas (H2), with the use of
   special enzymes called hydrogenases in the case of bio photolysis, and
   nitrogenases catalyze the formation of hydrogen in the case of photo
   fermentation. Nevertheless, oxygen sensitivity of these enzymes is a
   drawback for bio photolysis and photo fermentation, whereas, the amount
   of hydrogen per unit substrate produced appears insufficient for dark
   fermentation. This review focuses on innovative advances in the
   bioprocess research, genetic engineering and bioprocess technologies
   such as microbial fuel cell technology, in developing bio hydrogen
   production.

AB A new process evaluation methodology of microalgae biodiesel has been
   developed. Based on four evaluation criteria, i.e. the net energy ratio
   (NER), biodiesel production costs, greenhouse gases (GHG) emission rate
   and water footprint, the model compares various technologies for each
   step of the process, from cultivation to oil upgrading. An innovative
   pathway (hybrid raceway/PBR cultivation system, belt filter press for
   dewatering, wet lipid extraction, oil hydrotreating and anaerobic
   digestion of residues) shows good results in comparison to a reference
   pathway (doubled NER, lower GHG emission rate and water footprint). The
   production costs are still unfavourable (between 1.94 and 3.35 Euro/L of
   biodiesel). The most influential parameters have been targeted through a
   global sensitivity analysis and classified: (i) lipid productivity, (ii)
   the cultivation step, and (iii) the downstream processes. The use of
   low-carbon energy sources is required to achieve significant reductions
   of the biodiesel GHG emission rate compared to petroleum diesel.

AB This review analyzes the current state of a specific niche of microalgae
   cultivation; heterotrophic growth in the dark supported by a carbon
   source replacing the traditional support of light energy. This unique
   ability of essentially photosynthetic microorganisms is shared by
   several species of microalgae. Where possible, heterotrophic growth
   overcomes major limitations of producing useful products from
   microalgae: dependency on light which significantly complicates the
   process, increase costs, and reduced production of potentially useful
   products. As a general role, and in most cases, heterotrophic
   cultivation is far cheaper, simpler to construct facilities, and easier
   than autotrophic cultivation to maintain on a large scale. This capacity
   allows expansion of useful applications from diverse species that is now
   very limited as a result of elevated costs of autotrophy; consequently,
   exploitation of microalgae is restricted to small volume of high-value
   products. Heterotrophic cultivation may allow large volume applications
   such as wastewater treatment combined, or separated, with production of
   biofuels. In this review, we present a general perspective of the field,
   describing the specific cellular metabolisms involved and the best-known
   examples from the literature and analyze the prospect of potential
   products from heterotrophic cultures.

AB The renewable production of isoprene (Isp) hydrocarbons, to serve as
   fuel and synthetic chemistry feedstock, has attracted interest in the
   field recently. Isp (C5H8) is naturally produced from sunlight, CO2 and
   H2O photosynthetically in terrestrial plant chloroplasts via the
   terpenoid biosynthetic pathway and emitted in the atmosphere as a
   response to heat stress. Efforts to institute a high capacity continuous
   and renewable process have included heterologous expression of the Isp
   synthesis pathway in photosynthetic microorganisms. This review examines
   the premise and promise emanating from this relatively new research
   effort. Also examined are the metabolic engineering approaches applied
   in the quest of renewable Isp hydrocarbons production, the progress
   achieved so far, and barriers encountered along the way.

AB Increasing energy demand has been a big challenge for current society,
   as the fossil fuel sources are gradually decreasing. Hence, development
   of renewable and sustainable energy sources for the future is considered
   one of the top priorities in national strategic plans. Bioenergy can
   meet future energy requirements - renewability, sustainability, and even
   carbon-neutrality. Bioenergy production from wastes and wastewaters is
   especially attractive because of dual benefits of energy generation and
   contaminant stabilization. There are several bioenergy technologies
   using wastes and wastewaters as electron donor, which include anaerobic
   digestion, dark biohydrogen fermentation, biohydrogen production using
   photosynthetic microorganisms, and bioelectrochemical systems (BESs).
   Among them BES seems to be very promising as we can produce a variety of
   value-added products from wastes and wastewaters, such as electric
   power, hydrogen gas, hydrogen peroxide, acetate, ethanol etc. Most of
   the traditional BES uses a membrane to separate the anode and cathode
   chamber, which is essential for improving microbial metabolism on the
   anode and the recovery of value-added products on the cathode.
   Performance of BES lacking a membrane can be seriously deteriorated, due
   to oxygen diffusion or substantial loss of synthesized products. For
   this reason, usage of a membrane seems essential to facilitate BES
   performance. However, a membrane can bring several technical challenges
   to BES application compared to membrane-less BES. These challenges
   include poor proton permeability, substrate loss, oxygen back diffusion,
   pH gradient, internal resistance, biofouling, etc. This paper aims to
   review the major technical barriers associated with membranes and future
   research directions for their application in BESs.

AB Among the technologies being examined to produce renewable fuels,
   microalgae are viewed by many in the scientific community as having the
   greatest potential to become economically viable. Algae are capable of
   producing greater than 50,000 kg/acre/year of biomass. Additionally,
   most algae naturally accumulate energy-dense oils that can easily be
   converted into transportation fuels. To reach economic parity with
   fossil fuels there are still several challenges. These include
   identifying crop protection strategies, improving harvesting and oil
   extraction processes, and increasing biomass productivity and oil
   content. All of these challenges can be impacted by genetic, molecular,
   and ultimately synthetic biology techniques, and all of these
   technologies are being deployed to enable algal biofuels to become
   economically competitive with fossil fuels.

AB Research studies on microalgae have increased in the last decades due to
   the wide range of applications associated to these photosynthetic
   microorganisms. Microalgae are an important source of oils and other
   biomolecules that can be used in the production of biofuels and
   high-valued products. However, the use of microalgae in these green
   processes is still not economically viable. One of the main costs
   associated to microalgal production is related to the harvesting
   process, as it usually accounts for about 20-30% of total cost.
   Therefore, this review focuses on the main harvesting processes applied
   to microalgae, presenting the main advantages and disadvantages of each
   method, to allow the selection of an appropriate procedure to
   effectively separate microalgal biomass from the culture medium. To
   reduce the associated costs, it is common to harvest microalgae in a
   two-step separation: (i) thickening procedures, in which microalgal
   slurry is concentrated to about 2-7% of total suspended solids; and (ii)
   dewatering procedures, which result in the concentration of microalgal
   slurry to 15-25% of total suspended solids. Selection of the adequate
   harvesting methods depends on the characteristics of the target
   microorganism and also on the type and value of the end product.

AB Despite environmental benefits of algal-biofuels, the energy-intensive
   systems for producing microalgae-feedstock may result in high GHG
   emissions. Trying to overcome energy-costs, this research analyzed the
   biodiesel production system via dry-route, based on Chlorella vulgaris
   cultivated in raceways, by comparing the GHG-footprints of diverse
   microalgae-biodiesel scenarios. These involved: the single system of
   biomass production (C0); the application of pyrolysis on the residual
   microalgal biomass (cake) from the oil extraction process (C1); the same
   as C0, with anaerobic cake co-digested with cattle manure (C2); the same
   conditions as in C1 and C2, by integrating in both cases (respectively
   C3 and C4), the microalgae cultivation with an autonomous ethanol
   distillery. The reduction of GHG emissions in scenarios with no such
   integration (C1 and C2), compared to CO, was insignificant (0.53% and
   4.67%, respectively), whereas in the scenarios with integration with
   ethanol production system, the improvements were 53.57% for C3 and
   63.84% for C4.

AB Bioproduction of hydrocarbons is one of the challenges facing post-peak
   oil production in the future. A credible option for the production of
   sustainable biodiesel or biojetfuels could be microalgae oils. The
   speciesBotryococcus brauniihas attracted particular interest due to its
   ability to accumulate large amounts of long-chain hydrocarbons,
   according to some special characteristics, which differentiate it from
   other organisms, as well as plants or bacteria. Indeed, the same species
   includes strains producing a high chimiodiversity of hydrocarbons,
   strains therefore classified into four races. In addition, this
   photosynthetic microorganism accumulates high hydrocarbon
   concentrations, which are trapped in an extracellular matrix, composed
   of polysaccharides and polymerized hydrocarbons. However, more work is
   required to understand the biological processes involved in the control
   of extracellular hydrocarbon accumulation. Recently, despite their slow
   growth rates, some strains of this microalga were grown relatively
   efficiently as continuous cultures in controlled photobioreactors.
   Potential perspectives would depend on current studies focusing on ways
   to improve the return on investments through either a milking-like
   process to separate biomass from hydrocarbons production or
   co-valorization of the biomass residues according to biorefinery
   approaches to produce compounds of industrial interest, from carotenoids
   to squalene, and even syngas.

AB Globally, nations are trying to address environmental issues such as
   global warming and climate change, along with the burden of declining
   fossil fuel reserves. Furthermore, countries aim to reach zero carbon
   emissions within the existing and rising global energy crisis.
   Therefore, bio-based alternative sustainable feedstocks are being
   explored for producing bioenergy. One such renewable energy resource is
   microalgae; these are photosynthetic microorganisms that grow on
   non-arable land, in extreme climatic conditions, and have the ability to
   thrive even in sea and wastewater. Microalgae have high photosynthetic
   efficiencies and biomass productivity compared to other terrestrial
   plants. Whole microalgae biomass or their extracted metabolites can be
   converted to various biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, biocrude
   oil, pyrolytic bio-oil, biomethane, biohydrogen, and bio jet fuel.
   However, several challenges still exist before faster and broader
   commercial application of microalgae as a sustainable bioenergy
   feedstock for biofuel production. Selection of appropriate microalgal
   strains, development of biomass pre-concentrating techniques, and
   utilization of wet microalgal biomass for biofuel production, coupled
   with an integrated biorefinery approach for producing value-added
   products, could improve the environmental sustainability and economic
   viability of microalgal biofuel. This article will review the current
   status of research on microalgal biofuels and their future perspective.

AB Purpose: Microalgae biodiesel has attracted considerable attention as a
   potential substitute for fossil fuels and biodiesel from food crops.
   Nevertheless, its reported climate impacts in the scientific literature
   vary significantly. This article describes and synthesizes the range of
   results found in the life cycle assessment (LCA) literature regarding
   microalgae biodiesel studies to investigate whether particular
   parameters, e.g. technologies, were associated with higher or lower
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions so that a best practice can be inferred
   from currently available LCA data and thereby recommended. Methods: A
   systematic literature review and meta-regression analysis (MRA) of 36
   LCA studies that report on the GHG emissions of microalgae biodiesel was
   conducted. An assessment of key aspects, including modelling choices and
   technologies, was performed. Furthermore, MRA models were formulated
   considering several variables of interest describing both technical and
   modelling choices to identify the main causes for the variability in GHG
   emissions per MJ of biodiesel. Variables chosen include: microalgae
   species; culture medium; cultivation system; source of CO2; extraction
   technology; conversion technology; system boundary; geographical scope;
   inclusion or exclusion of capital goods; and how multifunctionality was
   handled. Results and discussion: The reviewed studies altogether
   reported 308 results ranging from -0.7 to 3.8 kg CO2 eq. MJ-1biodiesel,
   portraying 19 different system configurations. Despite the comprehensive
   range of variables assessed, the models generated could not plausibly
   explain that the variability in GHG emissions depends either on the
   technologies considered or on the methodological choices adopted.
   However, the following relationships could be observed: location in
   Europe and high oil productivity were associated with lower emissions,
   whilst dry extraction should be avoided for leading to higher GHG
   emissions, on average. Conclusions: There is a large degree of
   variability within the technologies considered, as well as the
   methodological choices adopted, so that no robust conclusions could be
   drawn from the MRA. Notwithstanding, average GHG emissions reported were
   more than twice as high as fossil diesel and, while there are some
   studies showing large benefits, none of the various algae technologies
   performed consistently better than fossil diesel, questioning the
   climate-mitigation potential of microalgae biodiesel.

AB Microalgae biodiesel is considered one of the most promising renewable
   fuels. However, the high cost of the downstream process is a major
   barrier to large-scale microalgal lipid production. In this study, a
   novel approach based on nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) was
   developed and its effectiveness for simultaneous harvesting and cell
   disruption in microalgal lipid production was determined. NiO NPs
   exhibited a microalgal harvesting efficiency of 98.75% in 1 min at pH 7.
   Moreover, after treating with NiO NPs for 96 h, the lipid extraction
   efficiency of microalgae (with 80% water content) reached 91.08% and was
   208.37% compared to that without NiO treatment. This approach is simple
   and does not necessitate drying; furthermore, no equipment with high
   energy consumption was required.

AB Microalgae are fast growing, accrue huge amounts of lipids (20-50% of
   dry weight), can survive in saline water and have great potential as a
   source of renewable fuel. The selection of a microalga strain and lipid
   extraction method vastly affects the economics and success of the
   algae-based oil industry. This study scrutinizes the selection of a
   microalga strain for maximum lipid yield, recent advances in cultivation
   systems including design and harvesting technologies, effectiveness of
   different lipid extraction methods with affected variable parameters,
   different technologies for converting algal oil to biodiesel,
   physical-chemical properties of algae biodiesel in comparison to
   biodiesel standards, and effects of microalgae biodiesel as a fuel on
   engine combustion, performance and emissions. The focus of this review
   paper is to conclude the research on cultivation, lipid extraction,
   conversion and engine applications by providing expedient information
   regarding efficient and commercially feasible technologies for the
   algae-based oil industry.

AB Microalgae represent one of the most promising groups of candidate
   organisms for replacing fossil fuels with contemporary primary
   production as a renewable source of energy. Algae can produce many times
   more biomass per unit area than terrestrial crop plants, easing the
   competing demands for land with food crops and native ecosystems.
   However, several aspects of algal biology present unique challenges to
   the industrial-scale aquaculture of photosynthetic microorganisms. These
   include high susceptibility to invading aquatic consumers and weeds, as
   well as prodigious requirements for nutrients that may compete with the
   fertiliser demands of other crops. Most research on algal biofuel
   technologies approaches these problems from a cellular or genetic
   perspective, attempting either to engineer or select algal strains with
   particular traits. However, inherent functional trade-offs may limit the
   capacity of genetic selection or synthetic biology to simultaneously
   optimise multiple functional traits for biofuel productivity and
   resilience. We argue that a community engineering approach that manages
   microalgal diversity, species composition and environmental conditions
   may lead to more robust and productive biofuel ecosystems. We review
   evidence for trade-offs, challenges and opportunities in algal biofuel
   cultivation with a goal of guiding research towards intensifying
   bioenergy production using established principles of community and
   ecosystem ecology.

AB Seasonal variation in microalgal biomass production is a well-known
   challenge when optimizing economics for algal fuel conversion,
   especially given the fluctuation in biomass production between winter
   and summer. Wet storage offers significant potential for cost and energy
   savings compared to dewatering and dry storage. This study demonstrates
   the feasibility of preserving harvested Scenedesmus acutus biomass
   through wet anaerobic storage for use in biochemical conversion.
   Anaerobic storage effectively preserved biomass with minimal degradation
   of carbohydrates and preservation of lipids and proteins. Screening
   experiments identified optimal pretreatment conditions for stored
   biomass. Scale-up of pretreatment enabled fermentation of the
   hydrolysate to butyric acid and indicated no observable difference in
   conversion between unstored and stored biomass. Lipid extraction
   improved by a relative 12% for stored biomass. These results suggest
   that wet anaerobic storage can effectively manage seasonal variation in
   biomass production and is compatible with biochemical approaches for
   biofuel production.

AB There is a continuous depletion of fossil resources recorded in
   20thcentury for the production of diesel that resulted in significant
   climatic change. The current study focuses on the challenges faced due
   to energy crisis and climate change followed by biodiesel production
   from various feedstock sources such as Soybean, Jatropha,Calophyllum
   inophyllum, and Microalgae. The pivotal aim of the study is to analyze
   the life cycle balance of biodiesel produced from three generation
   feedstocks. These sources were selected based on energy balance and
   Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, specifically on the aspect of
   Well-to-Pump module. The results infer that GHG emission was stringent
   in the production of soybean biodiesel i.e., 32.53 gCO2Eq/MJ whereas
   other sustainable measures such as net energy value, net renewable
   energy value, and energy ratio were low in the life cycle of
   microalgae-based biodiesel. This phenomenon indicates its efficiency in
   obtaining the maximal energy output. On the contrary, about 49.44
   gCO2Eq/MJ was produced during all the stages of biodiesel production
   from microalgae. In terms of sensitivity, the output dependency over
   input value was also estimated since it showcases the significant
   influence of cultivation, transportation, oil extraction and biodiesel
   production upon biodiesel Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). After taking the
   entire LCA values, sensitivity analyses of selected feedstocks and the
   importance of food crops into account, the biodiesels produced from
   Jatropha andCalophyllum inophyllumfeedstocks were found to be viable and
   possess the ability to overcome GHG emission challenges without
   compromising the energy balance.

U2 142
AB Algal biofuel is regarded as one of the ultimate solutions for renewable
   energy, but its commercialization is hindered by growth limitations
   caused by mutual shading and high harvest costs. We overcome these
   challenges by advancing machine learning to inform the design of a
   semi-continuous algal cultivation (SAC) to sustain optimal cell growth
   and minimize mutual shading. An aggregation-based sedimentation (ABS)
   strategy is then designed to achieve low-cost biomass harvesting and
   economical SAC. The ABS is achieved by engineering a fast-growing
   strain,Synechococcus elongatusUTEX 2973, to produce limonene, which
   increases cyanobacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and enables
   efficient cell aggregation and sedimentation. SAC unleashes
   cyanobacterial growth potential with 0.1 g/L/hour biomass productivity
   and 0.2 mg/L/hour limonene productivity over a sustained period in
   photobioreactors. Scaling-up the SAC with an outdoor pond system
   achieves a biomass yield of 43.3 g/m2/day, bringing the minimum biomass
   selling price down to approximately $281 per ton.

U1 2
U2 24
AB Environmental and energy security has now become a serious global
   problem, requiring a lot of research to find and implement its
   cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. The
   development and use of renewable energy sources is necessary and
   important in order to avoid the emergence of a global economic crisis.
   One of the solution to prevent a future crisis caused by energy
   shortages is to introduce biofuels into the fuel market. Despite the
   fact that various forms of renewable energy are currently used, the
   prospects for the production of biofuels from cyanobacteria are quite
   high due to their unique properties, such as a high lipid content and a
   suitable fatty acid (FA) composition for the production of biofuels,
   their suitability for growing open water and the ability to grow on
   wastewater. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive
   overview of the potential of cyanobacteria in the conversion of
   wastewater into biofuels. The article covers comparative data on the
   accumulation of lipids and the content of fatty acids in various
   representatives of cyanobacteria and their possibilities in the
   remediation of wastewater. Various approaches to the extraction of
   lipids from phototrophic microorganisms that are currently available,
   their advantages and disadvantages, and the results of the monitoring of
   the main key points of the development of the technology for converting
   cyanobacterial biomass into biofuels, with an emphasis on the existing
   barriers, effects and solutions, are also considered. Further research
   in this field is required for the successful implementation of this
   technology on an industrial scale.

AB Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that have the capacity to
   synthesize a diverse range of biomolecules depending on their
   phylogenetic classification. Microalgae hold promise as sustainable and
   renewable energy resources; however, their full potential remains
   untapped due to the costliness and time-intensive nature of downstream
   processing. The objective of this study is to overcome these challenges
   by utilizing a single processing unit for the extraction of three major
   biomolecule classes namely, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. These
   biomolecules of marineChlorellasp. NITT 02 were recovered in a single
   extraction process using the triphasic system. The parameters defining
   the triphasic system were optimized for the maximum recovery of
   biomolecules using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) coupled Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) optimization. The simultaneous complete recovery of
   lipids with 86.46% of total fatty acids, 97% protein recovery and 97.1%
   carbohydrate recovery were obtained with (i) 2.5:1 of t-butanol:culture
   volume, (ii) 70% t-butanol, (iii) 32.9% ammonium sulfate, and (iv) 55
   min sonication time. All three extracted biomolecule classes were
   characterized using FTIR, GC-MS, UV-Visible spectrophotometry, and XRD.
   From the current investigation, the recovery efficiency of the triphasic
   system is higher than the conventional sequential extraction of
   biomolecules and the time taken for extraction is 1.25 h with energy
   consumption of 0.7833 kWh. Hence, the adoption of this biorefinery
   approach is suitable for making microalgae commercially viable for
   producing valuable products from the biomolecules.

AB Bioenergy productions from microalgae have received wide attention
   recently and have a high potential to replace fossil fuels. Moreover,
   due to the high photosynthetic efficiency, microalgae mass cultivation
   and scale-up are believed to efficiently reduce the impact of greenhouse
   gas emissions. This review article explores the potential of microalgae
   as a reliable and sustainable source of bioenergy feedstock. The current
   review article contains an in-depth discussion of the various methods of
   producing energy using microalgae, viz. algal fuel cell (AFC), microbial
   fuel cell (MFC), bioethanol and biodiesel, and various other
   applications. This article discussed the different aspects of AFC and
   MFC, such as fuel cell configurations, reaction mechanisms at
   electrodes, reactor design factors affecting the efficiencies, and
   strategies to enhance the efficiencies. Moreover, microalgae
   cultivation, value-added compounds (pigments, polysaccharides,
   unsaturated fatty acids), liquid fuel production, limitations, the
   global scenario of microalgae biomass-based energy, and significant
   advancements in this field. In a nutshell, this review serves as a
   valuable resource for identifying, developing, and harnessing the
   potential of microalgae as a promising biofuel source.

AB The production of biofuels from microalgae, especially biodiesel, has
   become a topic of great interest in recent years. However, many of the
   published papers do not consider the question of scale up and the
   feasibility of the various processes to be operated at the very large
   scale required if algal biofuels are to make a meaningful contribution
   to renewable fuels. All the steps in the process must also be very low
   cost. This paper discusses the unit processes required for algal
   biofuels production (i.e., growing the algae, harvesting, dewatering,
   extraction and conversion to biofuel) and their scalability. In many
   cases, especially in the lipid extraction step, little is known as yet
   as to the scalability and economic feasibility of the various processes
   proposed. We also highlight the key engineering and biological issues
   which must be resolved for the production of biofuels from microalgae to
   become an economic reality.

AB A number of bio-feedstocks are currently being experimented for
   biodiesel production and usage. Algal biomass has emerged as one of the
   most promising sources of biodiesel production. Although research into
   algae as a potential source of biodiesel is not new, the current oil
   crises and fast depleting fossil oil reserves have made it more
   imperative for organizations and countries to invest more time and
   efforts into research on suitable renewable energy options such as algal
   oil. Algal fuel as a viable alternative to traditional fuel (diesel) is
   renewable, carbon neutral, economically sustainable and environmentally
   friendly. Algal oil can be extracted with methanol via
   transesterification reaction in the presence of a catalyst to yield
   biodiesel. The biodiesel produced can be used as jet fuel and as source
   of fuel in other transportation systems. Finally, since algal oil is
   non-edible, it does not compromise edible oil which is for human
   consumption thus, erasing the food versus fuel debate. An attempt is
   made to review the potential and prospects of microalgae as a
   sustainable energy provider, thus, providing a stimulus to initiate more
   research in this area.

AB Microalgae have attracted significant attention worldwide as one of the
   most promising feedstock fossil fuel alternatives. However, there are a
   few challenges for algal fuels to compete with fossil fuels that need to
   be addressed. Therefore, this study reviews the R&D status of
   microalgae-based polyculture and biocrude oil production, along with
   wastewater treatment. Mixotrophic algae are free to some extent from
   light restrictions using organic matter and have the ability to grow
   well even in deep water-depth cultivation. It is proposed that
   integrating the mixotrophic microalgae polyculture and wastewater
   treatment process is the most promising and harmonizing means to
   simultaneously increase capacities of microalgae biomass production and
   wastewater treatment with a low land footprint and high robustness to
   perturbations. A large amount of mixotrophic algae biomass is harvested,
   concentrated, and dewatered by combining highly efficient sedimentation
   through flocculation and energy efficient filtration, which reduce the
   carbon footprint for algae fuel production and coincide with the
   subsequent hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conversion. HTL products are
   obtained with a relatively low carbon footprint and separated into
   biocrude oil, solid, aqueous, and gas fractions. Algae biomass
   feedstock-based HTL conversion has a high biocrude oil yield and quality
   available for existing oil refineries; it also has a bioavailability of
   the recycled nitrogen and phosphorus from the aqueous phase of algae
   community HTL. The HTL biocrude oil represents higher sustainability
   than conventional liquid fuels and other biofuels for the combination of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy return on investment (EROI). Deep
   water-depth polyculture of mixotrophic microalgae using sewage has a
   high potential to produce sustainable biocrude oil within the land area
   of existing sewage treatment plants in Japan to fulfill imported crude
   oil.

AB Microalgae are a promising source of third generation renewable fuels.
   However, the biofuel production process from microalgae growth through
   to fuel production is still generally regarded as not economically
   viable. One area of particular consideration, for requiring more cost
   effective methods, is the recovery or harvesting stage. Among the
   several harvesting methods that have been proposed and used, flotation
   is emerging as one of significant promise. This review highlights why
   flotation can offer better harvesting characteristics than other methods
   by looking at work that has been carried out to date, as well as
   discussing the need for further developments in key areas.

AB The thermal characteristics of Actinobacillus succinogenes (AS) from
   pyrolysis, torrefaction, and combustion are analyzed to evaluate the
   potential of this biomass as a renewable fuel. AS pyrolysis can be
   classified into four stages, and its main decomposition zone is at
   200-500°C. The solid yield of AS after 60 min torrefaction is over 60
   wt%, and the torrefaction severity index map indicates that a high
   torrefaction temperature with a short duration has a more profound
   influence on its decomposition. The Py-GC/MS analysis of AS suggests
   that the volatile products from 500°C pyrolysis are similar to
   microalgae-derived pyrolysis bio-oils. The combustibility index (S) of
   AS is 4.07 * 10-7 which is much higher than that of lignite coal (0.39 *
   10-7) and bituminous coal (0.18 * 10-7), and close to those of biochar
   and bio-oil. The obtained results are conducive to the development of
   microorganisms as fuel to achieve a circular bioeconomy.

   Hydrogen is a zero-carbon and energy dense alternative energy carrier
   with clean burning properties and biohydrogen production by microalgae
   can reduce production associated GHG emissions to a great extent.
   Biohydrogen can be produced through dark fermentation using sugars,
   starch, or cellulosic materials. Microalgae-based biohydrogen production
   is recently regarded as a promising pathway for biohydrogen production
   via photolysis or being a substrate for anaerobic fermentation. This
   review lists the methods of hydrogen production by microalgae. The
   enzymes involved and the factors affecting the biohydrogen production
   process are discussed. The bottlenecks in microalgae-based biohydrogen
   production are critically reviewed and future research areas in hydrogen
   production are presented.

AB The massive amounts of nutrients that are currently released into the
   environment as waste have the potential to be recovered and transformed
   from a liability into an asset through photosynthesis, industry insight,
   and ecologically informed engineering design aimed at circularity.
   Fast-growing aquatic plant-like vegetation such as microalgae and
   duckweed have the capacity to enable local communities to simultaneously
   treat their own polluted water and retain nutrients that underlie the
   productivity of modern agriculture. Not only are they highly effective
   at upcycling waste nutrients into protein-rich biomass, microalgae and
   duckweed also offer excellent opportunities to substitute or complement
   conventional synthetic fertilizers, feedstocks in biorefineries, and
   livestock feed while simultaneously reducing the energy consumption and
   greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise be required for their
   production and transport to farms. Integrated systems growing microalgae
   or duckweed on manure or agricultural runoff, and subsequent reuse of
   the harvested biomass to produce animal feed, soil amendments, and
   biofuels, present a sustainable approach to advancing circularity in
   agricultural systems. This article provides a review of past efforts
   toward advancing the circular nitrogen bioeconomy using microalgae- and
   duckweed-based technologies to treat, recover, and upcycle nutrients
   from agricultural waste. The majority of the work with microalgae- and
   duckweed-based wastewater treatment has been concentrated on municipal
   and industrial effluents, with <50% of studies focusing on agricultural
   wastewater. In terms of scale, more than 91% of the microalgaebased
   studies and 58% of the duckweed-based studies were conducted at
   laboratory-scale. While the range of nutrient removals achieved using
   these technologies depends on various factors such as species, light,
   and media concentrations, 65% to 100% of total N, 82% to 100% of total
   P, 98% to 100% of NO3 -, and 96% to 100% of NH3/NH4+ can be removed by
   treating wastewater with microalgae. For duckweed, removals of 75% to
   98% total N, 81% to 93% total P, 72% to 98% NH3/NH4+, and 57% to 92% NO3
   - have been reported. Operating conditions such as hydraulic retention
   time, pH, temperature, and the presence of toxic nutrient levels and
   competing species in the media should be given due consideration when
   designing these systems to yield optimum benefits. In addition to
   in-depth studies and scientific advancements, policies encouraging
   supply chain development, market penetration, and consumer acceptance of
   these technologies are vitally needed to overcome challenges and to
   yield substantial socio-economic and environmental benefits from
   microalgae- and duckweed-based agricultural wastewater treatment.

AB The continuous increase in world energy demand will lead to an energy
   crisis due to the limited availability of fossil fuels. Furthermore, the
   use of this energetic resource is responsible for the accumulation of
   greenhouse gases in atmosphere that is associated with several negative
   effects on environment. Therefore, it is worth to search for different
   energy supplies that are renewable and environmentally friendly - carbon
   neutral fuel. Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that can
   achieve high oil contents. This oil is suitable for producing biodiesel;
   thus, microalgae are considered a promising sustainable energetic
   resource that can reduce the dependence on fossil fuel. Biodiesel
   production from microalgae includes several steps, such as cell
   cultivation and harvesting, oil extraction and biodiesel synthesis.
   Although several attempts have been made to improve biodiesel yields
   from microalgae, further studies are required to improve biodiesel
   production rates and to reduce the associated costs. This review shows
   the recent developments on biodiesel production from microalgae,
   emphasizing two process concepts: (1) indirect route, in which, after a
   facultative cell wall disruption method, microalgal oil is recovered in
   an appropriate solvent and then converted into biodiesel through
   transesterification and (2) direct route, in which biodiesel is produced
   directly from the harvested biomass. High biodiesel yields are obtained
   when both routes are preceded by a cell wall disruption method. In the
   indirect route, it is possible to apply three different types of
   solvents to recover microalgal oil. Although there are several concerns
   about the application of organic solvents, the most promising and
   cost-effective alternative for lipid recovery is n-hexane. Comparing
   direct and indirect routes, this study demonstrates that although
   further studies are required to optimize biodiesel production from
   microalgae, the available information proposes that the direct route is
   the most efficient.

AB One of the major challenges associated with algal fuels production from
   heterotrophic Chlorella (H. Chr.) is the rigid and complex structure of
   the cell wall. The cell wall of H. Chr. consists mainly of hydrophilic
   carbohydrates that prevent contact between the extraction solvent and
   the microalgal cells. Moreover, the cross-link ether structure on the
   thick cell wall, which causes part of the lipid to bind to the
   biopolymers by means of a glycosidic bond, also prevents lipid
   extraction. Chemical pretreatment is necessary to overcome cell wall
   recalcitrance of H. Chr. and promote lipid extraction efficiency. Among
   the different pretreatment methods, acid could disrupt the cell wall
   more efficiently and make lipid extraction available without drying. The
   best result was obtained with H2SO4 at a concentration of 0.5 M, 120°C
   for 1 h and the solid load was 10% (wt.). Under these conditions, the
   lipid yield was 41.41% (based on raw material) and the solid residue
   yield was 11.88%.

AB Energy needs and environmental concerns are leading to the search for
   alternative renewable fuels such as biodiesel. Biodiesel from microalgae
   has recently gained attention due to the drawbacks of other feedstocks
   such as edible oils. Recent research is focussing on techniques to
   convert feedstock into quality biodiesel in a cost-effective way. Here,
   we review conventional and in situ biodiesel synthesis from microalgae.
   We present the various catalysts and ultrasonic reactors. We found that
   biodiesel production through ultrasonication assisted in situ processing
   of wet microalgae is at least three times more expensive than biodiesel
   production through conventional mechanisms from feedstocks such as waste
   cooking oil. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of
   ultrasound-intensified biodiesel production from microalgae.

AB Societal developments are hinged on the energy supplied by fossil fuels.
   However, the supply of these fuels is finite in the foreseeable future.
   This is aside the associated environmental degradation and economic
   sustainability of these fuels. These negative consequences and
   challenges spurred the search for sustainable energy sources such as
   biofuels. However, affordable feedstocks and efficient synthesis for
   renewable fuels remain indispensable and yet challenging line of
   research. Therefore, breakthroughs in plant biotechnology and mass
   production are essential prerequisites for ensuring the sustainability
   of biofuels as alternatives to petroleum-based energy. Conversely,
   public outcry concerning the food-for-fuel conflicts and land-use change
   hinder the popularity of such biofuel energy sources. Therefore, this
   paper reviewed the prospects of biogasoline production as sustainable
   alternative to ethanol and a compliment to biodiesel. Apart from
   reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, biogasoline promises to be
   cheaper and more environmental friendly. Further, inedible feedstocks
   such as microalgae and rubber seed oil would ensure higher net energy
   gain. Consequently, these will help resolve the food-for-fuel conflicts
   and land-use competitions. However, achieving the biofuel central policy
   depends on advances in processing the renewable energy sources.

AB Worldwide concern on the negative effect of climate change towards human
   and environment has synergized the development of CO2capture
   technologies. Currently, culturing of microalgae for CO2bio-fixation has
   gained a huge momentum due to their high photosynthetic rate that allows
   bio-fixation of CO2more efficient than terrestrial plants. In addition,
   lipid from microalgae biomass can be converted to biodiesel; a renewable
   fuel that emits less CO2compared to fossil-diesel when combusted.
   However, several recent life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have
   revealed that enormous energy input is required to cultivate microalgae
   and also for the harvesting and drying processes. The energy required
   (in the form of electricity) is normally generated from burning coal or
   natural gas that emits substantial amount of CO2to the atmosphere and
   this could entirely eliminate all the positive effect of culturing
   microalgae for CO2bio-fixation and biofuel production. Thus, in this
   review, critical assessment and comparative study of CO2bio-fixation
   rate by microalgae and CO2emission rate during cultivation and
   processing of microalgae biodiesel were carried out. In addition, the
   prospects and limitations of using flue gas to culture microalgae and
   several possible strategies to enhance CO2utilization by microalgae will
   also be discussed extensively.

AB Roadmaps towards sustainable bioeconomy, including the production of
   biofuels, in many EU countries mostly rely on biomass use. However,
   although biomass is renewable, the efficiency of biomass production is
   too low to be able to fully replace the fossil fuels. The use of land
   for fuel production also introduces ethical problems in increasing the
   food price. Harvesting solar energy by the photosynthetic machinery of
   plants and autotrophic microorganisms is the basis for all biomass
   production. This paper describes current challenges and possibilities to
   sustainably increase the biomass production and highlights future
   technologies to further enhance biofuel production directly from
   sunlight. The biggest scientific breakthroughs are expected to rely on a
   new technology called "synthetic biology", which makes engineering of
   biological systems possible. It will enable direct conversion of solar
   energy to a fuel from inexhaustible raw materials: sun light, water and
   CO2. In the future, such solar biofuels are expected to be produced in
   engineered photosynthetic microorganisms or in completely synthetic
   living factories.

AB The prospects of biofuel production from microalgal carbohydrates and
   lipids coupled with greenhouse gas mitigation due to photosynthetic
   assimilation of CO2 have ushered in a renewed interest in algal
   feedstock. Furthermore, microalgae (including cyanobacteria) have become
   established as commercial sources of value-added biochemicals such as
   polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoid pigments used as antioxidants
   in nutritional supplements and cosmetics. This article presents a
   comprehensive synopsis of the metabolic basis for accumulating lipids as
   well as applicable methods of lipid and cellulose bioconversion and
   final applications of these natural or refined products from microalgal
   biomass. For lipids, one-step in situ transesterification offers a new
   and more accurate approach to quantify oil content. As a complement to
   microalgal oil fractions, the utilization of cellulosic biomass from
   microalgae to produce bioethanol by fermentation, biogas by anaerobic
   digestion, and bio-oil by hydrothermal liquefaction are discussed.
   Collectively, a compendium of information spanning green renewable fuels
   and value-added nutritional compounds is provided.

AB The rapid expansion of industrialization and continuous population
   growth have caused a steady increase in energy consumption. Despite
   using renewable energy, such as bioethanol, to replace fossil fuels had
   been strongly promoted, however the outcomes were underwhelming,
   resulting in excessive greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Microalgal
   biochar, as a carbon-rich material produced from the pyrolysis of
   biomass, provides a promising solution for achieving net zero emission.
   By utilizing microalgal biochar, these GHG emissions can be captured and
   stored efficiently. It also enhances soil fertility, improves water
   retention, and conduct bioremediation in agriculture and environmental
   remediation field. Moreover, incorporating microalgal biochar into a
   zero-waste biorefinery could boost the employ of biomass feedstocks
   effectively to produce valuable bioproducts while minimizing waste. This
   contributes to sustainability and aligns with the concepts of a circular
   bioeconomy. In addition, some challenges like commercialization and
   standardization will be addressed in the future.

AB The environmental load of continuous bioenergy production from palm oil
   (Elaeis guineensis) included with a proposed 10 ha of microalgae
   production system were assessed to be implemented in Indonesia. Material
   and energy balances, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, nutrient requirement
   and also water scarcity during bioenergy production cycle were
   evaluated. The integrated system was developed for 60 tons h-1of fresh
   fruit bunch (FFB) processing capacity of a conventional mill. Aggregate
   of energy-profit ratio from the proposed system was 5.20, which
   indicates a positive balance. The total water footprint for each palm
   oil and microalgae cultivation was 3.18 and 2.85 m3kg-1of biodiesel
   production, respectively. Microalgae mix-culture has the potential to
   treat organic compounds from palm oil mill effluent (POME) and combined
   with flue gases from biomass and biogas power plant as the alternative
   nutrient sources contributed to net-reduction of GHG emission for 158.8
   tons ha-1of microalgae culture, annually. The integrated system produced
   26,471 tons of biodiesel that included 223 tons from microalgae and
   contribute to 39.90% of total GHG emission reduction from diesel fuel
   substitute. Additional co-product of 520.33 tons year-1of animal feed
   from defatted biomass also possible to be produced and have potential
   for environmental benefits.

AB The rapid increase of CO2concentration in the atmosphere combined with
   depleted supplies of fossil fuels has led to an increased commercial
   interest in renewable fuels. Due to their high biomass productivity,
   rapid lipid accumulation, and ability to survive in saline water,
   microalgae have been identified as promising feedstocks for
   industrial-scale production of carbon-neutral biodiesel. This study
   examines the principles involved in lipid extraction from microalgal
   cells, a crucial downstream processing step in the production of
   microalgal biodiesel. We analyze the different technological options
   currently available for laboratory-scale microalgal lipid extraction,
   with a primary focus on the prospect of organic solvent and
   supercritical fluid extraction. The study also provides an assessment of
   recent breakthroughs in this rapidly developing field and reports on the
   suitability of microalgal lipid compositions for biodiesel conversion.

AB Microalgae are widely recognized as a promising bioresource for
   producing renewable fuels and chemicals. Microalgal biorefinery has
   tremendous potential for incorporation into circular bioeconomy,
   including sustainability, cascading use, and waste reduction. In this
   study, genetic engineering was used to enhance the growth, lipid and
   lutein productivity ofChlamydomonas reinhardtiiincluding strains of
   CC400, PY9, pCHS, and PG. Notably, CRISPRi mediated on
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC1) gene to down-regulate the branch
   pathway from glycolysis to partitioning more carbon flux to lipid was
   explored undermeso-thermophilic condition. The best chassis PGi, which
   has overexpressed chaperone GroELS and applied CRISPRi resulting in the
   highest biomass of 2.56 g/L and also boosted the lipids and lutein with
   893 and 23.5 mg/L, respectively at 35°C. Finally, all strains with
   CRISPRi exhibited higher transcriptional levels of the crucial genes
   from photosynthesis, starch, lipid and lutein metabolism, thus reaching
   a CO2assimilation of 1.087 g-CO2/g-DCW in mixotrophic condition.

AB A cross-flow ultrafiltration harvesting system for a pre-concentrated
   microalgae culture was tested in an innovative anaerobic-based WRRF. The
   microalgae culture was cultivated in a membrane photobioreactor fed with
   effluent from an anaerobic membrane bioreactor treating sewage. These
   harvested microalgae biomasses were then anaerobically co-digested with
   primary and secondary sludge from the water line. Depending on the needs
   of this anaerobic co-digestion, the filtration harvesting process was
   evaluated intermittently over a period of 212 days for different
   operating conditions, mainly the total amount of microalgae biomass
   harvested and the desired final total solids concentration (up to 15.9
   g.L-1 with an average of 9.7 g.L-1). Concentration ratios of 15-27 were
   obtained with average transmembrane fluxes ranging from 5 to 28
   L.m-2.h-1. Regarding membrane cleaning, both backflushing and chemical
   cleaning resulted in transmembrane flux recoveries that were, on
   average, 21% higher than those achieved with backflushing alone. The
   carbon footprint assessment shows promising results, as the GHG
   emissions associated with the cross-flow ultrafiltration harvesting
   process could be less than the emissions savings associated with the
   energy recovered from biogas production from the anaerobic valorisation
   of the harvested microalgae.

AB The development of alternative, sustainable sources of fuels is
   necessary for addressing the increasing world's energy demand and global
   warming crisis. Butanol, an important and promising biofuel candidate,
   is generally produced from heterotrophic microorganisms by carbohydrate
   fermentation. Cyanobacteria can serve as an alternative feedstock for
   third and fourth-generation biofuel production. Biofuel and biochemical
   synthesis from CO2 using photosynthetic organisms is an attractive
   approach. These prokaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms have been used
   as an energy feedstock and also genetically engineered for direct
   conversion of CO2 into butanol. This review aims to highlight the
   crucial aspects of photosynthetic biobutanol synthesis. The review
   explores the recent advances in biobutanol production from
   cyanobacteria. It reviews the recent and classical cyanobacterial
   genetic modification approaches and the advances in synthetic biology
   toolboxes of cyanobacteria. It discusses both third and
   fourth-generation butanol synthesis while emphasizes more on genetic
   modifications used in metabolic engineering and their effects on butanol
   production. Challenges associated with strain development, cultivation,
   butanol toxicity, and recovery have also been discussed.

AB Microalgae is a potential candidate to produce renewable fuels. However,
   current gasification technologies are limited due to char- and
   tar-accumulation in the gasifier. We have reported a single step,
   tar-free catalytic reactive flash volatilisation (RFV) of microalgae to
   produce hydrogen or methane. In this work, the experimental results were
   used to develop a detailed ASPEN PLUS flowsheet model to perform
   techno-economic assessment of hydrogen and methane production. A plant
   located in India, processing 12790 kg/h of microalgae to produce 1239
   kg/h of H2or 3484.96 kg/h of CH4was considered. Process scale-up and
   heat integration principles were used to generate relevant data.
   Simultaneously, the experimental and simulation data are used to perform
   life cycle assessment (LCA). The results indicated that the payback
   period for hydrogen production was 3.78 years with 22% of IRR. Moreover,
   the life cycle climate change impact was 7.56 kg CO2eq./kg H2produced,
   which was 36.47% lower than the steam reforming of methane. Methane
   production was not economically feasible. However, it was
   environmentally preferred with the life cycle climate change impact of
   1.18 kg CO2eq./kg CH4produced. Sensitivity analysis was performed to
   identify opportunities to achieve further reduction in costs and life
   cycle impacts. It was observed that the payback period was more
   sensitive to feedstock cost compared to other parameters. 25% increase
   in the feedstock cost resulted into 35.38% increase in the payback
   period.

AB BACKGROUND: Microalgae are among the most promising options for
   renewable fuel production in the future. Translating high laboratory
   yields to outdoor productivity has been a major challenge. Outdoor
   sunlight intensity is much greater than the saturation light intensities
   of algae. An open outdoor growth system design has been developed based
   on systematic distribution of sunlight to improve the productivity.
   RESULTS: The first stage of the light-distribution design (1800 L)
   yielded 1.5-2.0 times better productivity than a standard open system,
   and the next stage (630 L) yielded 2-3 times better productivity.
   Productivities up to 36-42 g m-2day-1were obtained in a region where the
   climatic conditions are mostly adverse for algal growth. Comparison with
   other similar climatic conditions validated the performance improvement
   of the growth system over a wide range. Light distribution profiles
   illustrated the distribution patterns and gave cues for further
   improvement. Cost comparison of light distribution against the
   additional land and infrastructure indicates promising reductions.
   CONCLUSION: The performance improvement shown by the designed growth
   system is significant and shows good potential for advancement of
   outdoor algal production for biofuels and related products.

AB Global warming, the diminishing availability of fossil fuels and
   increasing expectations of quality of life are driving the move towards
   renewable fuel sources. The production of biofuel from Botryococcus
   braunii is a high potential carbon neutral resource which has recently
   gained increased interest. Botryococcus braunii stores hydrocarbons
   within a lipid based extracellular matrix (ECM), allowing the continuous
   non-destructive extraction (milking) of these hydrocarbons without the
   compromisation of cellular integrity. This provides an alternate pathway
   to biofuels, with significantly reduced nutrient and energy
   requirements. The aim of this review is to utilise the current
   literature on B. braunii and available solvent extraction technologies
   to make informed recommendations on the required course of action for
   furthering this source of renewable energy. Solvent extraction with
   hexane, through a sieve plate column, was found to be the most suited
   method for repetitive non-destructive hydrocarbon extraction (milking).
   This method can provide high extraction efficiencies, a simple
   downstream separation process, relatively low cost, low shear stress and
   offers the added option of pulsing for further improvement on mass
   transfer. Considering, this concept is still relatively new to
   literature, areas such as; race selection, milking frequency/period,
   hydrocarbon recovery period, extraction system design and nutrient
   supplementation are still in the early stages of development, leaving
   much room for improvement. As progression is made in these fields and
   more data becomes available, a detailed feasibility study for
   non-destructive solvent extraction from B. braunii can be carried out,
   demonstrating the potential of B. braunii as a sustainable source of
   biofuel.

AB Biodiesel is an eco-friendly renewable fuel that can be derived from
   microalgae. Maximization of biomass and lipid productivities are
   considered the main challenges for algal biodiesel production. Since
   conventional batch cultures are time-, space-, and reagent-consuming
   with many restrictions to apply many replicates, microfluidic technology
   has recently emerged as an alternative low-cost and efficient technology
   with high throughput repeatability and reproducibility. Different
   applications of microfluidic devices in algal biotechnology have been
   reported, including cell identification, sorting, trapping, and
   metabolic screening. In this work,Chlorella vulgariswas investigated by
   encapsulating in a simple droplet-based micro-array device at different
   light intensities of 20, 80, and 200 mumol/m2/s combined with different
   nitrate concentrations of 17.6, 8.8, and 4.4 mM. The growth results
   forC. vulgariswithin microfluidic device were compared to the
   conventional batch culture method. In addition, the effect of combined
   stress of deficiencies in irradiance and nitrogen availability were
   studied to illustrate their impact on the metabolic profiling of
   microalgae. The results showed that the most optimum favorable culturing
   conditions forChlorella vulgarisgrowth within the microfluidic channels
   were 17.6 mM and 80 mumol/m2/s.

AB The sustainable, efficient production of biofuel can lead to reductions
   in greenhouse gas emissions, lowered climate change impact and increased
   security owing to the fulfilment of global energy demands. Microalgae
   have been shown as an attractive feedstock for renewable fuel
   production, such as biodiesel and biogas. To date, more effort has been
   put towards the production of biodiesel using the lipid contents in
   algal cells, while less attention has been placed on biogas production
   through anaerobic digestion. However, anaerobic digestion has the
   potential to generate energy from waste residues and to mobilize
   nutrients enabling subsequent recovery and/or recycling. Therefore,
   anaerobic digestion is an area with strong potential for novel research
   focusing on the development of a sustainable integrated system of
   biodiesel and biogas production. The result is essentially a solar power
   plant, producing fuel with minimal inputs and a closed nutrient loop, a
   necessity for sustainable and cost-efficient production of biofuel. In
   this review we discuss relevant studies on biodiesel and biomethane
   production, including the potential improvements and advantages when
   using an integrated approach for biodiesel and biogas production with
   special focus on nutrient recycling.

AB Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms with potential for biofuel
   production, CO2 mitigation and wastewater treatment; indeed they have
   the capacity to assimilate pollutants in wastewaters. Light supply and
   distribution among the microalgae culture is one of the major challenges
   of photo-bioreactor design, with many studies focusing on microalgae
   culture systems such as raceway ponds (RWP), widely used and
   cost-effective systems for algal biomass production. This review focuses
   on possible improvements of the RWP design in order to achieve optimal
   microalgal growth conditions and high biomass productivities, to
   minimize energy consumption and to lower the capital costs of the pond.
   The improvement strategy is based on three aspects: (1) hydrodynamic
   characteristics of the raceway pond, (2) evaluation of hydrodynamic and
   mass transfer capacities of the pond and (3) design of the RWP. Finally,
   a possible optimal design for the RWP is discussed in the context of
   wastewater treatment.

AB Biological hydrogen production by cultivation of photosynthetic
   microorganisms offers an alternative clean, sustainable and conventional
   source of energy. Cyanobacteria produce molecular hydrogen by the
   activity of nitrogenases or hydrogenases. Cyanobacteria have evolved
   several strategies to protect the nitrogenases from the inhibitory
   effect of oxygen, which include spatial and temporal separation of
   nitrogen fixing and oxygen evolving processes and developing physical
   barriers like heterocysts to diffusion of oxygen. Reversible
   hydrogenases catalyze both uptake and evolution of hydrogen. Oxygen and
   nitrogen free atmosphere have been reported to dramatically increase the
   activity of reversible hydrogenase. In view of the requirement of oxygen
   free environment for both nitrogenases and hydrogenases involved in
   cyanobacterial hydrogen production, future research needs to be focused
   on exploration of novel species from diverse habitats with greater
   hydrogen evolving capability, development of mutants that lack hydrogen
   oxidizing enzyme, uptake hydrogenase and optimization of conditions in
   the algal bioreactors. Synergy between basic and applied aspects needs
   to be developed to make cyanobacterial hydrogen production sustainable
   and feasible alternative fuel in future.

AB Sunlight energy largely exceeds the energy required by anthropic
   activities, and therefore its exploitation represents a major target in
   the field of renewable energies. The interest in the mass cultivation of
   green microalgae has grown in the last decades, as algal biomass could
   be employed to cover a significant portion of global energy demand.
   Advantages of microalgal vs. plant biomass production include higher
   light-use efficiency, efficient carbon capture and the valorization of
   marginal lands and wastewaters. Realization of this potential requires a
   decrease of the current production costs, which can be obtained by
   increasing the productivity of the most common industrial strains, by
   the identification of factors limiting biomass yield, and by removing
   bottlenecks, namely through domestication strategies aimed to fill the
   gap between the theoretical and real productivity of algal cultures. In
   particular, the light-to-biomass conversion efficiency represents one of
   the major constraints for achieving a significant improvement of algal
   cell lines. This review outlines the molecular events of photosynthesis,
   which regulate the conversion of light into biomass, and discusses how
   these can be targeted to enhance productivity through mutagenesis,
   strain selection or genetic engineering. This review highlights the most
   recent results in the manipulation of the fundamental mechanisms of
   algal photosynthesis, which revealed that a significant yield
   enhancement is feasible. Moreover, metabolic engineering of microalgae,
   focused upon the development of renewable fuel biorefineries, has also
   drawn attention and resulted in efforts for enhancing productivity of
   oil or isoprenoids.

AB Microbial photosynthesis presents a valuable opportunity to capture
   abundant light energy to produce renewable bioenergy and biomaterials.
   To understand the factors that control the productivity of
   photosynthetic microorganisms, we conducted a series of semi-continuous
   experiments using bench-scale photobioreactor (PBR) systems, the
   cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 (PCC6803), and light conditions
   imitating actual day-night light irradiance (LI). Our results
   demonstrate that using normal BG-11 medium resulted in severe phosphate
   (Pi) limitation for continuous operation. Mitigation of Pi-limitation,
   by augmenting the Pi content of BG-11, allowed higher biomass
   productivity; however, once Pi-limitation was alleviated, limitation by
   inorganic carbon (Ci) or LI occurred. Ci-limitation was detected by a
   low total Ci concentration (<5 mg C/L) and high and fluctuating pH.
   Ci-limitation was relieved by delivering more CO2, which led to a stable
   pH in the range of 7-9 and at least 5 mg/L of Ci in HCO3-. LI
   limitation, evidenced by an average LI<14 W/m2 for PCC6803, was induced
   by a high biomass concentration of 1,300 mg/L. Thus, this work provides
   quantitative tools of stoichiometry and kinetics to evaluate limitation
   on PBRs.

AB Microalgae is an alternative feedstock for biofuel production and has
   been considered to be a potential biotechnology. However, the systems
   for industrial biofuel production from microalgae are still costly and
   unsuitable. In addition, the complex and changeable processes contained
   in different bioenergy conversion systems make it difficult to
   reasonably compare these systems. This study aim to obtain an optimal
   microalgae-based industrial system using life-cycle assessment, and to
   unify the uncertainties caused by the discrepancies of each process. Two
   types of bioenergy conversion systems were modelled and compared: (1)
   transesterification, hydrothermal liquefaction, and pyrolysis for
   renewable diesel production and (2) anaerobic digestion without/with
   hydrothermal pretreatment for biogas production. The life-cycle impacts
   of these systems were quantified in terms of net energy ratios (NERs)
   and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results show that anaerobic
   digestion system with hydrothermal pretreatment is more industrially
   feasible and eco-friendly at the industrial scale due to its low NER
   (0.71) and GHG emissions [-60.84 g CO2-eq(MJ biogas)-1].

AB Biofuels made from algal biomass are being considered as the most
   suitable alternative energy in current global and economical scenario.
   Microalgae are known to produce and accumulate lipids within their cell
   mass which is similar to those found in many vegetable oils. The
   efficient lipid producer algae cell mass has been reported to contain
   more than 30% of their cell weight as lipids. According to US DOE
   microalgae have the potential to produce 100 times more oil per acre
   land than any terrestrial plants. This article reviews up to date
   literature on the composition of algae, mechanism of oil droplets,
   triacylglycerol (TAG) production in algal biomass, research and
   development made in the cultivation of algal biomass, harvesting
   strategies, and recovery of lipids from algal mass. The economical
   challenges in the production of biofuels from algal biomass have been
   discussed in view of the future prospects in the commercialisation of
   algal fuels.

AB The use of fossil fuels has been strongly related to critical problems
   currently affecting society, such as: global warming, global greenhouse
   effects and pollution. These problems have affected the homeostasis of
   living organisms worldwide at an alarming rate. Due to this, it is
   imperative to look for alternatives to the use of fossil fuels and one
   of the relevant substitutes are biofuels. There are different types of
   biofuels (categories and generations) that have been previously
   explored, but recently, the use of microalgae has been strongly
   considered for the production of biofuels since they present a series of
   advantages over other biofuel production sources: (a) they don't need
   arable land to grow and therefore do not compete with food crops (like
   biofuels produced from corn, sugar cane and other plants) and; (b) they
   exhibit rapid biomass production containing high oil contents, at least
   15 to 20 times higher than land based oleaginous crops. Hence, these
   unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms have received great attention
   from research to use them in the large-scale production of biofuels.
   However, one disadvantage of using microalgae is the high economic cost
   due to the low-yields of lipid content in the microalgae biomass. Thus,
   development of different methods to enhance microalgae biomass, as well
   as lipid content in the microalgae cells, would lead to the development
   of a sustainable low-cost process to produce biofuels. Within the last
   10 years, many studies have reported different methods and strategies to
   induce lipid production to obtain higher lipid accumulation in the
   biomass of microalgae cells; however, there is not a comprehensive
   review in the literature that highlights, compares and discusses these
   strategies. Here, we review these strategies which include modulating
   light intensity in cultures, controlling and varying CO2levels and
   temperature, inducing nutrient starvation in the culture, the
   implementation of stress by incorporating heavy metal or inducing a high
   salinity condition, and the use of metabolic and genetic engineering
   techniques coupled with nanotechnology.

AB The use of fossil fuels has faced the world with new challenges, so that
   renewable energy has become a part of the world's total energy
   consumption. Iran is rich in natural energy resources and can consider
   for using the renewable fuels like biofuels as an alternative to
   non-renewable. This study has two purposes. First, it purposes to
   provide an overview on all studies conducted in Iran in the field of
   biodiesel production from microalgae and fish waste. Second, it purposes
   to study the biodiesel production potential from those two sources in
   Bushehr province. Overall, 109 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved, of
   which 15 original articles were included. The results of the systematic
   review showed that biodiesel production research from algae and fish
   waste in Iran has increased in the last ten years. In addition, the
   minimum and maximum algae lipid content was obtained equal 17.5 and 52%,
   respectively. The lowest and highest amount of oil productivity was
   obtained equal 0.026 and 0.154 g/l.day, respectively. Also, the
   biodiesel production potential of Bushehr from aquatic algae and fish
   waste was estimated at about 196.1 kt, which is equal to 19.25% of the
   total diesel fuel requirements of Bushehr and 1.2% of the total diesel
   consumption of Iran in transportation sector. In general, the total
   revenue of $ 118.8 million from the aquatic microalgae and fish waste of
   Bushehr province can be obtained. The study concludes with biodiesel
   production policy concepts and avenues for future researches.

AB Microalgae and other phototrophic microorganisms can be cultivated to
   produce food and valuable bioproducts, also allowing to remove nutrients
   from wastewater and CO2from biogas or polluted gas streams. Among other
   environmental and physico-chemical parameters, microalgal productivity
   is strongly influenced by the cultivation temperature. In this review,
   cardinal temperatures identifying the thermal response, i.e., the
   optimal growth condition (TOPT), and the lower and upper limits for
   microalgae cultivation (TMINand TMAX), have been included in a
   structured and harmonized database. Literature data for 424 strains
   belonging to 148 genera of green algae, cyanobacteria, diatoms, and
   other phototrophs were tabulated and analysed, with a focus on the most
   relevant genera that are currently cultivated at the industrial scale in
   Europe. The dataset creation aimed at facilitating the comparison of
   different strain performances for different operational temperatures and
   assisting in the process of thermal and biological modelling, to reduce
   energy consumption and biomass production costs. A case study was
   presented, to illustrate the effect of temperature control on the
   energetic expenditure for cultivating differentChorellasp. strains under
   a greenhouse located in different European sites.

   opportunities of hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrotreatment.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 354
PY 2024
U1 14
U2 36
AB The current technical issues related to the conversion of algal biomass
   into aviation biofuel through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and the
   upgrading of bio-oil through hydrotreatment have been reviewed and
   consolidated. HTL is a promising route for converting microalgae into
   sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, HTL must be followed by the
   hydrotreatment of bio-oil to ensure that its composition and properties
   are compatible with SAF standards. The fact that microalgae offer the
   possibility of recovering wastewater treatment resources not only makes
   them more attractive but also serves as an incentive for wastewater
   treatment, especially in countries where this service has not been
   universalized. The combination of SAF and wastewater treatment aligns
   with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations,
   representing an advantageous opportunity for both aviation and
   sanitation. In this context, the utilization of HTL by-products in the
   concept of a biorefinery is essential for the sustainability of aviation
   biofuel production through this route. Another important aspect is the
   recovery and reuse of catalysts, which are generally heterogeneous,
   allowing for recycling. Additionally, discussions have focused on
   biomass pretreatment methods, the use of solvents and catalysts in HTL
   and hydrotreatment reactions, and the operational parameters of both
   processes. All these issues present opportunities to enhance the
   quantity and quality of bio-oil and aviation biofuel.

U1 47
U2 130
AB The advancement in carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration technology has
   received significant attention due to the adverse effects of CO2 on
   climate. The mitigation of the adverse effects of CO2 can be
   accomplished through its conversion into useful products or renewable
   fuels. In this regard, microalgae is a promising candidate due to its
   high photosynthesis efficiency, sustainability, and eco-friendly nature.
   Microalgae utilizes CO2 in the process of photosynthesis and generates
   biomass that can be utilized to produce various valuable products such
   as supplements, chemicals, cosmetics, biofuels, and other value-added
   products. However, at present microalgae cultivation is still restricted
   to producing value-added products due to high cultivation costs and
   lower CO2 sequestration efficiency of algal strains. Therefore, it is
   very crucial to develop novel techniques that can be cost-effective and
   enhance microalgal carbon sequestration efficiency. The main aim of the
   present manuscript is to explain how to optimize microalgal CO2
   sequestration, integrate valuable product generation, and explore novel
   techniques like genetic manipulations, phytohormones, quantum dots, and
   AI tools to enhance the efficiency of CO2 sequestration. Additionally,
   this review provides an overview of the mass flow of different
   microalgae and their biorefinery, life cycle assessment (LCA) for
   achieving net-zero CO2 emissions, and the advantages, challenges, and
   future perspectives of current technologies. All of the reviewed
   approaches efficiently enhance microalgal CO2 sequestration and
   integrate value-added compound production, creating a green and
   economically profitable process.

U1 9
U2 144
AB Plant biostimulants are defined as materials containing microorganisms
   or substances whose function when applied to plants or the rhizosphere
   is to stimulate natural mechanisms to enhance plant growth, nutrient use
   efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stressors and crop quality, independent
   of their nutrient content. In agriculture, seaweeds (Macroalgae) have
   been used in the production of plant biostimulants while microalgae
   still remain unexploited. Microalgae are single cell microscopic
   organisms (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) that grow in a range of aquatic
   habitats, including, wastewaters, pounds, lakes, rivers, oceans, and
   even humid soils. These photosynthetic microorganisms are widely
   described as renewable sources of biofuels, bioingredients and
   biologically active compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids
   (PUFAs), carotenoids, phycobiliproteins, sterols, vitamins and
   polysaccharides, which attract considerable interest in both scientific
   and industrial communities. Microalgae polysaccharides have so far
   proved to have several important biological activities, making them
   biomaterials and bioactive products of increasing importance for a wide
   range of applications. The present review describes microalgae
   polysaccharides, their biological activities and their possible
   application in agriculture as a potential sustainable alternative for
   enhanced crop performance, nutrient uptake and resilience to
   environmental stress. This review does not only present a comprehensive
   and systematic study of Microalgae polysaccharides as plant
   biostimulants but considers the fundamental and innovative principles
   underlying this technology.

AB Photosynthetic microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria and microalgae, are
   currently being investigated as alternative biomass resources for
   bioethanol production, owing to their benefits, including
   high-photosynthetic activity and whole-year cultivation without
   utilization of arable land. Polyglucans comprise the major carbohydrate
   content of these organisms. Polyglucans can be utilized as a carbon
   source for microbial fermentation. Although polyglucan production has so
   far been promoted by nutrient limitation, it must be further enhanced to
   accommodate market demand. This review focuses on the recent progress in
   the production of alpha-polyglucans such asglycogen and starch in
   cyanobacteria and green microalgae via cultivation design, including
   modifying the nutrient supply and replacing the growth medium. The
   control and manipulation of polyglucan metabolism necessitates the
   elucidation of the polyglucan production mechanism. We reviewed gene
   expression and metabolite accumulation profiles of cyanobacteria and
   green microalgae during nutrient limitation-stimulated alpha-polyglucan
   accumulation. We also focus on the enhancement in cyanobacterial
   glycogen production via the genetic engineering of glycolysis,
   CO2concentration mechanism, and photosynthetic light-harvesting protein
   based on the polyglucan accumulation mechanism. The combined strategies
   of cultivation design and genetic engineering should be considered for
   further enhancement of polyglucan productivity for bioethanol
   production.

AB Biodiesel is considered as a renewable fuel because it can be obtained
   from the transformation of vegetable oils, cooking greases or animal
   fats. Currently, oleaginous plants like rapeseed, sunflower, palm oil
   and soybean are the most important sources of biodiesel. However, the
   productivity of some of these crops are considered relatively low and
   they require long extension of lands. In this context, microalgae has
   been emerged as a source of natural oil due to its lipids, starch and
   hydrocarbon contents. Microalgae produces about ten times more oil than
   oleaginous plants and it can be grown in systems like open ponds and
   photobioreactors. Open raceway ponds are well known because they have
   been used to grow algae for food, nutritional complements and others.
   Their construction is less expensive compared to photobioreactors, but
   their productivity is lower. Photobioreactors can be found with
   different configurations (e.g. tubular, annular, plastic bags) and they
   have numerous advantages over open raceway ponds: superieur control of
   nutrients, light exposition and carbon dioxide absorption, as well as
   contamination avoidance with other microorganisms. These culture systems
   receive special attention because they can use carbon dioxide from flue
   gases and nutrients from wastewater to perform microalgae growth. The
   most common species to be found in literature and experimental studies
   are Chlorella sp., Spirulina sp. and Dunaliella sp. Several
   universities, organizations and governmental departments have been
   working in microalgae production systems, their design as well as the
   factors that influence microalgae growth. In this context, this study
   develops a review about current systems, microalgae species, their
   requirements and their oil production. Also, the potential production of
   algal biodiesel is compared with the current biodiesel production.

AB As the demand for biofuels increases globally, microalgae offer a viable
   biomass feedstock to produce biofuel. With abundant sources of biomass
   in rural communities, these materials could be converted to biodiesel.
   Efforts are being done in order to pursue commercialization. However,
   its main usage is for other applications such as pharmaceutical,
   nutraceutical, and aquaculture, which has a high return of investment.
   In the last 5 decades of algal research, cultivation to genetically
   engineered algae have been pursued in order to push algal biofuel
   commercialization. This will be beneficial to society, especially if
   coupled with a good government policy of algal biofuels and other
   by-products. Algal technology is a disruptive but complementary
   technology that will provide sustainability with regard to the world's
   current issues. Commercialization of algal fuel is still a bottleneck
   and a challenge. Having a large production is technical feasible, but it
   is not economical as of now. Efforts for the cultivation and production
   of bio-oil are still ongoing and will continue to develop over time. The
   life cycle assessment methodology allows for a sustainable evaluation of
   the production of microalgae biomass to biodiesel.

AB Microalgae have been highlighted as one of the promising feedstocks for
   renewable fuel production owing to their high growth rate, ability to
   grow on wastewater, and to convert CO2 into lipids, the main source of
   biodiesel. However, lipid extraction from microalgal cells is cumbersome
   due to its thick cell wall which precludes commercial biodiesel
   production from microalgae, and to improve the lipid extraction
   efficiency, optimization of the operational parameters is crucial. One
   of the well-known challenges is to develop an economical technique to
   obtain a high lipid extraction efficiency. Hence, this study aimed to
   investigate the optimized conditions of lipid extraction from marine
   species of Nannochloropsis sp. PTCC 6016 isolated from the Persian Gulf
   using Soxhlet, Bligh & Dyer, and ultrasonication methods. Initially,
   Nannochloropsis sp. was cultivated in a 1000L open pond for the purpose
   of lipid evaluation and process optimization, to be transferred to a
   2000 L and subsequently, a 30000L open pond. Effects of various solvent
   ratios, mixing time and mixing frequency, pre-treatment, and cell age
   have been evaluated, and the optimal conditions have been determined.
   Lipid extraction prediction has been investigated by artificial neural
   network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) methods. Experimental
   results show that the maximum extraction yield of 0.56 gr extracted
   lipid/gr dry biomass was obtained using Soxhlet method after 90 days of
   cultivation using chloroform-methanol (1:1) as extraction solvents.
   However, considering 10 times higher solvent used in Soxhlet method
   compared to Bligh and Dyer and ultrasonication methods, the
   ultrasonication method was the most desired option for lipid extraction
   efficiency of Nannochloropsis sp. in large-scale operations. In this
   regard, cost-effective biofuel production should be considered as the
   focus of future studies to achieve sustainability, energy security and
   addressing the climate change due to high greenhouse gas emissions.

   fuel: life cycle assessment comparing hydrothermal routes.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 360
PY 2024
U1 15
U2 40
AB The present paper compared, through life cycle assessment (LCA), the
   production of aviation biofuel from two hydrothermal routes of
   microalgae cultivated in wastewater. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and
   gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (G + FT) were
   compared. Both routes included biomass production, hydrotreatment for
   biofuel upgrading, and product fractionation. Secondary data obtained
   from the literature were used for the cradle-to-gate LCA. G + FT had a
   higher impact than HTL in the 18 impact categories assessed, with human
   carcinogenic toxicity exerting the most harmful pressure on the
   environment. The catalysts were the inputs that caused the most adverse
   emissions. The solvent used for bio-oil separation also stood out in
   terms of impacts. In HTL, emissions for global warming were -51.6 g CO2
   eq/MJ, while in G + FT, they were 250 g CO2 eq/MJ. At the Endpoint
   level, HTL resulted in benefits to human health and ecosystems, while G
   + FT caused environmental damage in these two categories, as well as in
   the resources category. In the improvement scenarios, besides
   considering solid, aqueous, and gaseous products as co-products rather
   than just as waste/emissions, a 20% reduction in catalyst consumption
   and 90% recovery were applied. Thus, in HTL, 39.47 kg CO2 eq was
   avoided, compared to 35.44 kg CO2 eq in the base scenario. In G + FT,
   emissions decreased from 147.55 kg CO2 eq to the capture of 8.60 kg CO2
   eq.

AB Microorganisms directly and indirectly contribute to production of
   diverse biofuels. Heterotrophic microorganisms are being used for
   commercial production of biofuels such as biogas and fuel alcohols from
   organic matter. Photosynthetic microorganisms convert inorganic carbon
   and water to potential fuels (e.g. fuel alcohols, biohydrogen) and fuel
   precursors (e.g. biomass, starch, lipids). Only a few microbial
   processes are used for commercial production of biofuels, but this will
   certainly change with the enhanced production capabilities being
   achieved through microbial metabolic engineering. Processes that
   previously required multiple steps of feedstock pretreatment and
   subsequent conversion to fuel are being consolidated into single-step
   microbial processes using metabolically engineered species.
   Microorganisms with the ability to produce fuels from feedstock they
   could not use previously, are being engineered. This review discusses
   some of the metabolic engineering approaches being used to enhance the
   commercialization potential of microbial biofuels including fuel
   alcohols, biodiesel and biohydrogen. At present, all biogas production
   relies on native populations of methanogens and this does not seem
   likely to change in the near term. Potential fuels from microalgae,
   cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria, whether native or
   engineered, have distant prospects of commercial use. Metabolically
   engineered yeasts surface displaying various hydrolytic enzymes appear
   to hold the greatest potential for near term commercial use in
   generating bioethanol from starch, pretreated lignocellulose and other
   polysaccharides. The bacterium Zymomonas mobilis metabolically
   engineered to make bioethanol from pentose sugars is already being
   commercialized. Other similar examples are likely to emerge as more
   engineered microorganisms become available.

AB Immense use of fossil fuels leads to various environmental issues,
   including greenhouse gas emissions, reduced oil reserves, increased
   energy costs, global climate changes, etc. These challenges can be
   tackled by using alternative renewable fuels such as biodiesel. Many
   studies reported that biodiesel production from microalgae biomass is an
   environment-friendly and energy-efficient approach, with significantly
   improved fuel quality in terms of density, calorific value and
   viscosity. Biodiesel is produced using the transesterification process
   and the most sustainable method is utilizing enzymes for
   transesterification. Lipase is an enzyme with excellent catalytic
   activity, specificity, enantio-selectivity, compatibility and stability
   and hence it is applied in microalgae biodiesel production. But,
   difficulty in enzymatic recovery, high enzyme cost and minimal reaction
   rate are some of its drawbacks that have to be addressed. In this
   aspect, the nanotechnological approach of lipase immobilization in
   producing microalgae biodiesel is a promising way to increase production
   yield and it is due to the adsorption efficiency, economic benefit,
   recyclability, crystallinity, durability, stability, environmental
   friendliness and catalytic performance of the bio-nanoparticles used.
   Through increasing post-harvest biomass yield, absorption of CO2 and
   photosynthesis in the photobioreactor, the use of nanoparticle
   immobilized lipase during the generation of biodiesel from microalgae
   has the potential to also remove feedstock availability constraints.
   This review article discusses the production of microalgae biodiesel,
   and effect of nanoparticles and immobilized lipase nanoparticles on
   biodiesel production. The advantages of using lipase nanoparticles and
   the challenges in introducing the immobilized lipase on nanoparticles in
   large-scale microalgae biodiesel production are also discussed. Reducing
   the water and land use, energy and nutrient footprints of integrated
   algae-based operations must be the main goal of larger-scale experiments
   as well as ongoing research and development in order to expedite the
   adoption of microalgae-based biodiesel production. Also, the
   cost-effectiveness and large-scale availability of nanoparticles and the
   impact of lipase nanoparticles on engine performance should be analyzed
   for commercialization of microalgae biodiesel.

AB The combustion of fossil fuels constitutes a significant catalyst for
   climate change, resulting in the annual release of about two billion
   tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). The increase in CO2 emission is directly
   linked to a heightened occurrence of natural calamities and
   health-related issues. The substitution of fossil fuels with renewable
   energy sources is a fundamental approach to reduce the negative impacts
   caused by consumption of these nonrenewable energy resources. The
   utilisation of biological methodologies to produce environmentally
   friendly energy from renewable sources holds significant potential for
   the sustainable production of fuel. However, the cultivation of first-
   and second-generation biofuel crops presents a challenge, since they
   compete for limited cropland, hence constraining their overall
   viability. In contrast, photosynthetic microorganisms such as algae and
   cyanobacteria exhibit significant potential as third-generation biofuel
   catalysts, devoid of the limitations associated with contemporary
   biofuels. Cyanobacteria, a type of photosynthetic prokaryotes, exhibit
   significant potential for the direct conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   into biofuels, chemicals, and various other valuable compounds. There
   has been a growing interest in the concept of utilising biological
   processes to convert carbon dioxide into fuels and chemicals. The
   introduction of a limited number of heterologous genes has the potential
   to confer upon cyanobacteria the capability to convert particular
   central metabolites into a diverse range of end products. The progress
   in the field of synthetic biology and genetic manipulation has enabled
   the manipulation of cyanobacteria to synthesise compounds that are not
   generally produced by these organisms in their natural environment. This
   study focuses on recent papers that employ various methodologies to
   engineer cyanobacteria for the purpose of producing high-value
   compounds, such as biofuels.

AB Due to anthropogenic emissions, there is an increase in the
   concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Microalgae are
   versatile, universal, and photosynthetic microorganisms present in
   nature. Biological CO2sequestration using microalgae is a novel concept
   in CO2mitigation strategies. In the current review, the difference
   between carbon capture and storage (CCS), carbon capture utilization and
   storage (CCUS), and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is clarified.
   The current status of CO2sequestration techniques is discussed,
   including various methods and a comparative analysis of abiotic and
   biotic sequestration. Particular focus is given to sequestration methods
   associated with microalgae, including advantages of CO2bio-sequestration
   using microalgae, a summary of microalgae species that tolerate high
   CO2concentrations, biochemistry of microalgal CO2biofixation, and
   elements influencing the microalgal CO2sequestration. In addition, this
   review highlights and summarizes the research efforts made on the
   production of various biofuels using microalgae. Notably,Chlorellasp. is
   found to be the most beneficial microalgae, with a sizeable hydrogen
   (H2) generation capability ranging from 6.1 to 31.2 mL H2/g microalgae,
   as well as the species ofC. salina,C. fusca,Parachlorella kessleri,C.
   homosphaera,C. vacuolate,C. pyrenoidosa,C. sorokiniana,C. lewinii, andC.
   protothecoides. Lastly, the technical feasibility and life cycle
   analysis are analyzed. This comprehensive review will pave the way for
   promoting more aggressive research on microalgae-based CO2sequestration.

AB The transport sector is responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions,
   mainly carbon dioxide (CO2). Its emissions are the main driver of the
   worsening global climate change scenario. Finding feasible options to
   sequester this greenhouse gas is a great challenge for scientists,
   governments, and industry. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage
   (CCUS) are technologies that capture CO2directly or indirectly by
   transforming it into other products of interest. In this context,
   biological CO2conversion can be performed by photosynthetic
   microorganisms, such as microalgae and cyanobacteria, producing a wide
   variety of bio-based added-value products, such as third-generation (3G)
   bioethanol. However, the main obstacle to the spread of 3G bioethanol is
   economical, as it is still a recent and little-explored technology,
   lacking technical and scientific development for its production to
   become economically viable. Within this perspective, this work presents
   a patent-based mapping of current technological trends in 3G bioethanol
   production, which revealed that it is an emerging field with 171 patent
   deposits since 1979, with a tendency of at least 10 patents published
   per year in the last 15 years. The main drawbacks industries are focused
   on remain those from 2G bioethanol production, such as biomass
   hydrolysis. Therefore, with extensive cooperation between governments,
   scientists, and industries, it may be a matter of time before 3G
   bioethanol production becomes a reality. The presented data are expected
   to contribute to technical knowledge of 3G ethanol production, including
   the knowledge transfer from the academy to the industrial sector.

U2 42
AB Water crisis around the world leads to a growing interest in emerging
   contaminants (ECs) that can affect human health and the environment.
   Research showed that thousands of compounds from domestic consumers,
   such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), personal care products
   (PCPs), and pharmaceuticals active compounds (PhAcs), could be found in
   wastewater in concentration mostly from ng L-1to mug L-1. However,
   generally, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed to
   remove these ECs from wastewater to their discharge levels. Scientists
   are looking for economically feasible biotreatment options enabling the
   complete removal of ECs before discharge. Microalgae cultivation in
   domestic wastewater is likely a feasible approach for removing emerging
   contaminants and simultaneously removing any residual organic nutrients.
   Microalgal growth rate and contaminants removal efficiency could be
   affected by various factors, including light intensity, CO2addition,
   presence of different nutrients, etc., and these parameters could
   greatly help make microalgae treatment more efficient. Furthermore, the
   algal biomass harvests could be repurposed to produce various bulk
   chemicals such as sustainable aviation fuel, biofuel, bioplastic, and
   biochar; this could significantly enhance the economic viability.
   Therefore, this review summarizes the microalgae-based bioprocess and
   their mechanisms for removing different ECs from different wastewaters
   and highlights the different strategies to improve the ECs removal
   efficiency. Furthermore, this review shows the role of different ECs in
   biomass profile and the relevance of using ECs-treated microalgae
   biomass to produce green products, as well as highlights the challenges
   and future research recommendations.

U1 19
U2 45
AB Botryococcus braunii has garnered significant attention in recent years
   due to its ability to produce high amounts of renewable hydrocarbons
   through photosynthesis. As the world shifts towards a greener future and
   seeks alternative sources of energy, the cultivation of B. braunii and
   the extraction of its hydrocarbons can potentially provide a viable
   solution. However, the development of a sustainable and cost-effective
   process for cultivating B. braunii is not without challenges. Compared
   to other microalgae, B. braunii grows very slowly, making it
   time-consuming and expensive to produce biomass. In response to these
   challenges, several efforts have been put into optimizing Botryococcus
   braunii cultivation systems to increase biomass growth and hydrocarbon
   production efficiency. This review presents a comparative analysis of
   different Botryococcus braunii cultivation systems, and the factors
   affecting the productivity of biomass and hydrocarbon in Botryococcus
   braunii are critically discussed. Attached microalgal growth offers
   several advantages that hold significant potential for enhancing the
   economic viability of microalgal fuels. Here, we propose that employing
   attached growth cultivation, coupled with the milking technique for
   hydrocarbon extraction, represents an efficient approach for generating
   renewable fuels from B. braunii. Nevertheless, further research is
   needed to ascertain the viability of large-scale implementation.

AB The total number of inhabitants on the Earth is estimated to cross a
   record number of 9 * 103 million by 2050 that present a unique challenge
   to provide energy and clean environment to every individual. The growth
   in population results in a change of land use, and greenhouse gas
   emission due to increased industrialization and transportation. Energy
   consumption affects the quality of the environment by adding carbon
   dioxide and other pollutants to the atmosphere. This leads to oceanic
   acidification and other environmental fluctuations due to global climate
   change. Concurrently, speedy utilization of known conventional fuel
   reservoirs causes a challenge to a sustainable supply of energy.
   Therefore, an alternate energy resource is required that can maintain
   the sustainability of energy and environment. Among different
   alternatives, energy production from high carbon dioxide capturing
   photosynthetic aquatic microbes is an emerging technology to clean
   environment and produce carbon-neutral energy from their
   hydrocarbon-rich biomass. However, economical challenges due to low
   biomass production still prevent the commercialization of bioenergy. In
   this work, we review the impact of fossil fuels burning, which is
   predominantly used to fulfill global energy demand, on the quality of
   the environment. We also assess the status of biofuel production and
   utilization and discuss its potential to clean the environment. The
   complications associated with biofuel manufacturing using photosynthetic
   microorganisms are discussed and directed evolution for targeted
   phenotypes and targeted delivery of nutrients are proposed as potential
   strategies to increase the biomass production.

AB Biodiesel is one of those renewable fuel sources developed to fuel
   transportation sector to replace conventional petroleum based fuels. In
   the present work the key concentration is directed towards highlighting
   engineering and biological issues to resolve the production of biofuels
   from microalgae to become an economic reality. This study discusses the
   unit processes required for algal biofuels production in municipal
   wastewater (i.e. growing the algae, harvesting, dewatering, extraction
   and conversion to biofuel) and their scalability. The economic
   estimation in this article is classified as a "study estimate" which had
   a range of expected accuracy from +30% to -20%. The comparison
   betweenMicrocystis aeruginosagrown in lab scale and microalgae grown in
   the oxidation pond system demonstrated that a mixed culture of algae
   species could successfully be grown on wastewater nutrients and
   potentially scaled to commercial production.Spirulina maximawas the most
   dominant species of microalgae in samples collected from Matrouh
   wastewater treatment plant, and responsible for the over growth detected
   in the maturation bond. Extracted oil from bothSpirulina
   maximaandMicrocystis aeruginosawas transesterified to evaluate the fatty
   acid methyl ester produced and to identify the purity of the biodiesel.
   Complete process simulation was carried out using a process simulation
   software. Assuming that the rate of biodiesel production needed was
   10,000 t/year, all process units required have been sized. Total capital
   investment, total manufacturing cost and return on investment (ROI) were
   all estimated. The ROI ofSpirulina maximacase equaled to 86.92%, while
   in case ofMicrocystis aeruginosawas -56.5%. So, the biofuel production
   fromSpirulina maximagrown in wastewater treatment plants is being
   economically feasible.

AB Microalgae can rapidly sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) and convert it
   into various marketable products. Thus, these photosynthetic
   microorganisms have gained substantial attention as prospective
   biological platforms for the practical reduction of CO2 and establishing
   renewable and sustainable supply chains. However, conventional biomass
   applications to which attention has been directed, such as a feedstock
   for biodiesel production, are only achievable through cumbersome
   downstream processes, including extraction, fractionation, separation,
   and refinement. These stereotypical biomass utilization strategies have
   increased concerns regarding economic, energetic, and environmental
   viability. As a promising alternative, utilization of whole microalgal
   biomass as end-products has emerged because it can directly provide
   various beneficial commodities through a streamlined production route
   only consisting of harvesting and drying processes. The process review
   in this study clearly shows the energy and CO2 reduction efficiencies of
   this strategy compared with other traditional production routes. Despite
   the high potential, this application strategy has been overlooked
   because of the limited commercialized examples and the broad use of
   established methods. Recently, many applications have been suggested,
   and their practicality has been thoroughly verified according to the
   main biochemical constituents, namely carbohydrates, proteins, and
   lipids. Raw microalgal biomass produced by a potentially carbon-negative
   and net-energy-positive process can be employed as-is in an extensive
   range of fields that cover most human needs, including nutritious foods
   and feeds with bioactive functions, cosmetics, thermoplastic materials,
   and fuels for direct combustion. Thus, this comprehensive review aims to
   provide an opportunity to reconsider the potential and practicality of
   whole microalgal biomass utilization strategies.

AB The need for sustainable production of renewable biofuel has been a
   global concern in the recent times. Overcoming the tailbacks of the
   first- and second-generation biofuels, third-generation biofuel using
   microalgae as feedstock has emerged as a plausible alternative. It has
   an added advantage of preventing any greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with
   simultaneous carbon dioxide sequestration. Dewatering of microalgal
   culture is one of the many concerns regarding industrial-scale biofuel
   production. The small size of microalgae and dilute nature of its growth
   cultures creates huge operational cost during biomass separation,
   limiting economic feasibility of algae-based fuels. Considering the
   recovery efficiency, operation economics, technological feasibility and
   cost-effectiveness, bio-flocculation is a promising method of
   harvesting. Moreover, advantage of bio-flocculation over other
   conventional methods is that it does not incur the addition of any
   external chemical flocculants. This article reviews the current status
   of bio-flocculation technique for harvesting microalgae at industrial
   scale. The various microbial strains that can be prospective
   bioflocculants have been reviewed along with its application and
   advantages over chemical flocculants. Also, this article proposes that
   the primary focus of an appropriate harvesting technique should depend
   on the final utilization of the harvested biomass. This review article
   attempts to bring forth the beneficial aspects of microbial aided
   microalgal harvesting with a special attention on genetically modified
   self-flocculation microalgae.

AB This article presents mass balances and a detailed life cycle assessment
   (LCA) for energy and greenhouse gases (GHGs) of a simulated microalgae
   biodiesel production system. Key parameters of the system include
   biomass productivity of 16 and 25 g m-2 day-1 and lipid content of algae
   of 40% and 25% for low and normal nitrogen conditions respectively.
   Based on an oil extraction efficiency from wet biomass of 73.6% and
   methane yields from anaerobically digested lipid-extracted biomass of
   0.31 to 0.34 l per gram of volatile solids, the mass balance shows that
   recycling growth media and recovering nutrients from residual biomass
   through anaerobic digestion can reduce the total demand for nitrogen by
   66% and phosphorus by 90%. Freshwater requirements can be reduced by 89%
   by recirculating growth media, and carbon requirements reduced by 40% by
   recycling CO2 from biogas combustion, for normal nitrogen conditions. A
   variety of technology options for each step of the production process
   and allocation methods for coproducts used outside the production system
   are evaluated using LCA. Extensive sensitivity and scenario analysis is
   also performed to provide better understanding of uncertainty associated
   with results. The best performing scenario consists of normal nitrogen
   cultivation conditions, bioflocculation and dissolved air flotation for
   harvesting, centrifugation for dewatering, wet extraction with hexane,
   transesterification for biodiesel production, and anaerobic digestion of
   biomass residual, which generates biogas used in a combined heat and
   power unit for energy recovery. This combination of technologies and
   operating conditions results in life cycle energy requirements and GHG
   emissions of 1.02 MJ and 71 g CO2-equivalent per MJ of biodiesel, with
   cultivation and oil extraction dominating energy use and emissions.
   Thus, even under optimistic conditions, the near-term performance of
   this biofuel pathway does not achieve the significant reductions in life
   cycle GHG emissions hoped for from second-generation biofuel feedstocks.

AB The removal of heavy metals combined with biodiesel production by
   microalgae in a cost-effective way is a promising approach. Herein, we
   grew two green microalgal species,Chlorella sorokinianaandScenedesmus
   acuminatus, in media contaminated with Cu2+(3.2 ppm) or Zn2+(65.4 ppm)
   to investigate their growth and full metabolic profile. Furthermore, to
   integrate the potential economic impact of biodiesel production with
   heavy metals removal efficiencies. Although acute exposure to heavy
   metals, on the other hand, reduced growth and increased removal
   efficiencies of Cu2+(59.4, 98.1%) and Zn2+(72.4, 98.2%) inC.
   sorokinianaandS. acuminatus, respectively. Besides, Cu2+and
   Zn2+increased primary metabolites, particularly lipids (49, 47% inS.
   acuminatus, 27, 26% inC. sorokiniana), with a significant induction in
   the unsaturation levels. Indicating thatC. sorokinianaandS.
   acuminatusare excellent phycoremediators for industrial drainage and
   future sustainable algal-biofuels platform. Economic assessment of daily
   1000-tonne biodiesel production fromS. acuminatusgrown on highly
   polluted wastewater via Na4SiO4transesterification catalysis has all
   been assessed with an accuracy of  10% for the price of the diesel of
   US$ 1000/tonne and for the cost of the evaluated algal biomass of US$
   430/tonne. The daily 1000 T algal diesel business was viable, with a
   return on high investment (16.4%) and a payback period of 5 years.
   According to break-even and sensitivity analyses, the algal diesel cost
   that makes this business viable should be greater than US$ 147/barrel,
   while the biomass cost should not exceed US$ 462/tonne. Brent Crude Oil
   Spot exceeds US$ 95/barrel indicating promising prospects for algal fuel
   industrialization. Furthermore, the protein and amino acids-based waste
   biomass may serve as a sustainable biorefienry platform for various
   biofuel industries through biomass conversion technologies.

AB By 2050, aviation-related carbon emissions are expected to quadruple to
   over 3000 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, so finding sustainable
   alternative solutions to minimise pollution is a key scientific
   challenge. Aviation gasoline and kerosene are currently used to power
   most jet engines. While battery-powered planes and planes that could
   utilise a cleaner fuel, such as hydrogen, are possible, the time scale
   required to improve and implement these technologies is distant, with
   air fleet turnover taking some 30 years. Existing jet engines could be
   modified to run on biodiesel, and considering the close similarity in
   fuel density to kerosene, could be a less disruptive approach to the
   industry. The sheer volume of biodiesel required remains a challenge,
   and certainly, using plant-derived oils grown on arable land is not
   acceptable, as it competes with food production. However,
   high-lipid-yielding microalgae (where productivity is an order of
   magnitude greater than oilseeds), grown on marginal land, such as desert
   or semi-desert areas of the world, could be possible. Indeed, to replace
   30% of fossil fuel with algal-derived biodiesel would require 11,345 km2
   of land. Biodiesel preparation is well understood, but what is lacking

AB Overuse of non-renewable fossil fuels due to the population explosion
   urges us to focus on renewable fuels such as bioethanol. It is a
   well-known fact that ethanol is useful as a blending product with common
   fuels such as petrol and diesel. This reduces the cost besides bringing
   down environmental pollution. Apart from chemical methods, bioethanol is
   generated from photosynthetic plants including algae, plant-based
   products, microbial organisms and their waste. Specifically, the
   production of ethanol from microalgal sources has been an attractive
   method in recent days. The reason behind using microalgal species is
   their simple structure with photosynthetic ability. In contrast, certain
   algal species often go disused in some regions. Hence, the production of
   ethanol from algal sources is one of the best waste management
   practices. Moreover, it is easy to improve the biomass in microalgal
   species by altering the physicochemical conditions such as light, pH,
   temperature, external supply of nutrients, vitamins, nano-sized
   particles, gene alterations etc., which will enhance ethanol production.
   In this review, the methods used for ethanol production are discussed.
   In addition, the factors involved in algal growth and ethanol production
   are emphasized. Overall, this review focuses on ethanol production from
   various algal species. This information will be useful for
   industrial-level production of ethanol and future renewable energy
   research.

AB Combating climate change and ensuring energy supply to a rapidly growing
   global population has highlighted the need to replace petroleum fuels
   with clean, and sustainable renewable fuels. Biofuels offer a solution
   to safeguard energy security with reduced ecological footprint and
   process economics. Over the past years, lignocellulosic biomass has
   become the most preferred raw material for the production of biofuels,
   such as fuel, alcohol, biodiesel, and biohydrogen. However, the
   cost-effective conversion of lignocellulose into biofuels remains an
   unsolved challenge at the industrial scale. Recently, intensive efforts
   have been made in lignocellulose feedstock and microbial engineering to
   address this problem. By improving the biological pathways leading to
   the polysaccharide, lignin, and lipid biosynthesis, limited success has
   been achieved, and still needs to improve sustainable biofuel
   production. Impressive success is being achieved by the retouring
   metabolic pathways of different microbial hosts. Several robust
   phenotypes, mostly from bacteria and yeast domains, have been
   successfully constructed with improved substrate spectrum, product yield
   and sturdiness against hydrolysate toxins. Cyanobacteria is also being
   explored for metabolic advancement in recent years, however, it also
   remained underdeveloped to generate commercialized biofuels. The
   bacterium Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains
   are also being engineered to have cell surfaces displaying hydrolytic
   enzymes, which holds much promise for near-term scale-up and biorefinery
   use. Looking forward, future advances to achieve economically feasible
   production of lignocellulosic-based biofuels with special focus on
   designing more efficient metabolic pathways coupled with screening, and
   engineering of novel enzymes.

AB Metabolically engineered cyanobacteria have the potential to mitigate
   anthropogenic CO2 emissions by converting CO2 into renewable fuels and
   chemicals. Yet, better understanding of metabolic regulation in
   cyanobacteria is required to develop more productive strains that can
   make industrial scale-up economically feasible. The aim of this study
   was to find the cause for the previously reported inconsistency between
   oscillating transcription and constant protein levels under day-night
   growth conditions. To determine whether translational regulation
   counteracts transcriptional changes, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was
   cultivated in an artificial day-night setting and the level of
   transcription, translation and protein was measured across the genome at
   different time points using mRNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and
   quantitative proteomics. Furthermore, the effect of protein turnover on
   the amplitude of protein oscillations was investigated through in silico
   simulations using a protein mass balance model. Our experimental
   analysis revealed that protein oscillations were not dampened by
   translational regulation, as evidenced by high correlation between
   translational and transcriptional oscillations (r = 0.88) and unchanged
   protein levels. Instead, model simulations showed that these
   observations can be attributed to a slow protein turnover, which reduces
   the effect of protein synthesis oscillations on the protein level. In
   conclusion, these results suggest that cyanobacteria have evolved to
   govern diurnal metabolic shifts through allosteric regulatory mechanisms
   in order to avoid the energy burden of replacing the proteome on a daily
   basis. Identification and manipulation of such mechanisms could be part
   of a metabolic engineering strategy for overproduction of chemicals.

AB Microalgae continue to be of great interest as a promising class of

   transportation fuel supplipes while reducing GHG emissions and
   dependence on imported petroleum through the displacement of
   petroleum-based fuel and chemical product usage. However, to
   significantly contribute to fuel supplies will require that algal
   biofuels be capable of scaling up to large aggregated quantities of
   biomass and fuel feedstock production that necessarily impose huge
   demands for land, water, energy, supplemental CO2and other key nutrients
   such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The resulting resource requirements
   will also impose constraints on the level of production scale-up that
   can be sustainably supported. This paper provides a high-level review of
   the current status and future prospects for these key resource demand
   and constraint challenges for the scale-up of autotrophic microalgal
   biofuel production. Emphasis is placed on the USA, although the issues

AB The biodiesel can be produced from diverse microalgae lipids as

   optimize theChlamydomonas reinhardtiipromising species as biodiesel
   feedstock for large-scale cultivation in Egypt. To understand some of
   the triggers required for the metabolic pathway switch to lipid
   accumulation, the effect of carbon sources and the three elements
   availability (N, P, S) inC. reinhardtiigrowth medium was determined. A
   local microalgaeC. reinhardtiiwas cultured in modified Sueoka medium
   containing various concentrations of CO2and bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (in
   2-liter flasks) as a carbon source. The optimal source in term biomass,
   high lipid productivity (10.3 mgL-1d-1) and a higher lipid content
   (22.76%) were obtained in 6% CO2culture. Then, the availability of N, P,
   S (various concentrations of N, P and S) nutrients elements was added to
   6% CO2culture, for produce a highest lipid content and lipid
   productivity. As expected, under low availability N-1.78 mM; P-0.14mM
   and S-0.10 mM mediums,C. reinhardtiishowed a high accumulation lipid
   content. Therefore, to improve the economic feasibility of microalgae
   biofuels production, its concentrations were selected to combine (N+P+S)
   in order to cultivation ofC. reinhardtiiin a multi-tubular
   photobioreactor (400 liter) to produce high lipid contents. Under
   limited condition, the biomass dry weight, biomass productivity, lipid
   content and lipid productivity were found to be 3.11 (gL-1), 0.150.012
   (g-1L-1d-1), 22.76% (w/w %) and 1.9 0.35 (mg-1L-1d-1), respectively. The
   extracted lipid was found to have physical and chemical properties
   similar that plant oils using for biodiesel production. The FAME
   profiling of prepared biodiesel shows the presence of considerable
   amount of 36.97% saturated fatty acids (palmitic acid and stearic acid,
   together) with 27.33% unsaturated (oleic acid and linoleic acid) fatty
   acids. The FAME had a low iodine value and high CN, which meet with the
   appropriate of biodiesel standards (EN 14214 and ASTM D6751). Thus,C.
   reinhardtiiappears to be more feasible for high quality biodiesel
   production.

AB The supply of nutrients is a great issue to a sustainable scale-up of
   microalgal biofuels production, as these photosynthetic microorganisms
   require large amounts of N, P and other micronutrients to grow, which
   turns into high fertilizers demand. Additionally, recovery and reuse of
   nutrients (particularly N & P) are a must to reduce the non-point
   pollution emanating from their release into water or air during the
   downstream processing steps to biofuels or bioproducts. In the recent
   years, strong research efforts have been paid for developing nutrient
   recovery and recycling techniques, in order to reduce the net amount of
   fertilizers required. One possibility is exploiting nutrients from waste
   streams, such as wastewaters, while others focus on the recovery of N
   and P from the non-fuel fraction of the produced microalgal biomass,
   which is then recycled to the cultivation system, in a closed-loop
   perspective. In both cases, the presence of possible contaminants as
   well as nutrients bioavailability can impact the biomass productivity
   compared to standard synthetic media. Although the nutrients recovery
   and reuse has been in the forefront for a few years, there are no review
   publications available yet. In this paper, state-of-the art studies on
   nutrients recovery and recycling methods in microalgae processing from
   the last decade are reviewed. The study focuses on the different N and P

AB Microalgae represent a carbon-neutral source of bulk biomass, for
   extraction of high-value compounds and production of renewable fuels.
   Due to their high metabolic activity and reproduction rates, species of
   the genusChlorellaare highly productive when cultivated in
   photobioreactors. However, wild-type strains show biological limitations
   making algal bioproducts expensive compared to those extracted from
   other feedstocks. Such constraints include inhomogeneous light
   distribution due to high optical density of the culture, and
   photoinhibition of the surface-exposed cells. Thus, the domestication of
   algal strains for industry makes it increasingly important to select
   traits aimed at enhancing light-use efficiency while withstanding excess
   light stress. Carotenoids have a crucial role in protecting against
   photooxidative damage and, thus, represent a promising target for algal
   domestication. We applied chemical mutagenesis toChlorella vulgarisand
   selected for enhanced tolerance to the carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor
   norflurazon. The NFR (norflurazon-resistant) strains showed an increased
   carotenoid pool size and enhanced tolerance towards photooxidative
   stress. Growth under excess light revealed an improved carbon
   assimilation rate of NFR strains with respect to WT. We conclude that
   domestication ofChlorella vulgaris, by optimizing both
   carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio and resistance to photooxidative stress,
   boosted light-to-biomass conversion efficiency under high light
   conditions typical of photobioreactors. Comparison with strains
   previously reported for enhanced tolerance to singlet oxygen, reveals
   that ROS resistance inChlorellais promoted by at least two independent
   mechanisms, only one of which is carotenoid-dependent.

AB Unicellular green algae have the ability to operate in two distinctly
   different environments (aerobic and anaerobic), and to
   photosynthetically generate molecular hydrogen (H2). A recently
   developed metabolic protocol in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
   permitted separation of photosynthetic O2-evolution and carbon
   accumulation from anaerobic consumption of cellular metabolites and
   concomitant photosynthetic H2-evolution. The H2 evolution process was
   induced upon sulfate nutrient deprivation of the cells, which reversibly
   inhibits photosystem-II and O2-evolution in their chloroplast. In the
   absence of O2, and in order to generate ATP, green algae resorted to
   anaerobic photosynthetic metabolism, evolved H2 in the light and
   consumed endogenous substrate. This study summarizes recent advances on
   green algal hydrogen metabolism and discusses avenues of research for
   the further development of this method. Included is the mechanism of a
   substantial tenfold starch accumulation in the cells, observed promptly
   upon S-deprivation, and the regulated starch and protein catabolism
   during the subsequent H2-evolution. Also discussed is the function of a
   chloroplast envelope-localized sulfate permease, and the
   photosynthesis-respiration relationship in green algae as potential
   tools by which to stabilize and enhance H2 metabolism. In addition to
   potential practical applications of H2, approaches discussed in this
   work are beginning to address the biochemistry of anaerobic H2
   photoproduction, its genes, proteins, regulation, and communication with
   other metabolic pathways in microalgae. Photosynthetic H2 production by
   green algae may hold the promise of generating a renewable fuel from
   nature's most plentiful resources, sunlight and water. The process
   potentially concerns global warming and the question of energy supply
   and demand.

AB Biorefineries are commercial facilities that transform raw materials
   into commodities of considerable interest to the world bioeconomy. In
   addition, biorefineries have the potential to achieve favorable
   environmental characteristics, such as minimal greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and a lower water footprint, compared to homologous fossil
   fuels. However, for this concept to become efficient and viable, the use
   of potentially abundant and specific renewable biological feedstocks
   should be considered, such as microalgae biomass and other generated
   products. However, there is an emerging need to consolidate industrial
   plants that are not only affected by market fluctuations but also aim to
   transform biological materials into industrially usable products. Thus,
   for a microalgae biorefinery to compete with the resilient oil
   refineries in the future, process integration in the supply chain is a
   promising engineering approach, associating all the components from the
   cultivation to obtain multiple products that are economically and
   environmentally sustainable. Therefore, the objective of this review is
   to compile issues related to microalgal biorefineries applied to
   bioenergy and biofuel production.

AB Two freshwater and two marine microalgae species were grown under
   nitrogen replete and deplete conditions evaluating the impact on total
   biomass yield and biomolecular fractions (i.e. starch, protein, and
   lipid). A life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate varying
   species/growth conditions considering each biomass fraction and final
   product substitution based on energy consumption, greenhouse gas
   emissions (GHG), and eutrophication potential. Lipid for biodiesel was
   assumed as the primary product. Protein and carbohydrate fractions were
   processed as co-products. Composition of the non-lipid fraction
   presented significant trade-offs among biogas production, animal feed
   substitution, nutrient recycling, and carbon sequestration. Maximizing
   total lipid productivity rather than lipid content yielded the least GHG
   emissions. A marine, N-deplete case with relatively low lipid
   productivity but effective nutrient recycling had the lowest
   eutrophication impacts. Tailoring algal species/growth conditions to
   optimize the mix of biomolecular fractions matched to desired products
   and co-products can enable a sustainable integrated microalgal
   biorefinery.

U2 110
AB Rising carbon emissions caused by population growth and
   industrialization is a significant environmental challenge in various
   countries. To combat this issue, Renewable Energy (RE) and Carbon
   Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies should be commercialized to
   reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and generate carbon-free energy.
   One such technology is the use of microalgae, which can directly capture
   CO2from the air through photosynthesis and potentially produce biofuels
   due to their high energy content. However, the carbon capture rate of
   microalgae varies globally due to numerous parameters and variables
   affecting microalgae productivity. Additionally, microalgae productivity
   and carbon capture formulas yield different results worldwide,
   especially in outdoor industrial-scale cultivation. This research aims
   to comprehensively review the effective variables and parameters in
   carbon capture by microalgae based on microalgae productivity and carbon
   capture formulas. The research also ranked countries based on
   CO2production in four different categories to determine whether the
   biggest carbon producer countries could exhibit suitable weather
   conditions for microalgae cultivation. Findings reveal optimal ranges of
   critical variables in the microalgae growth formula, including
   temperature, solar radiation intensity, Photon Flux Density (PFD), and
   sunlight duration. The study also analyzes microalgae cultivation,
   carbon capture, and oxygen production formula in different systems such
   as Open Ponds (OP), Tubular Photobioreactors (TPBR), and Flat Plate
   Photobioreactors (FPPBR), while discussing other influential parameters.
   In conclusion, emphasizing the adjustment and utilization of optimal
   values of effective parameters in microalgae cultivation not only holds
   promise for future carbon capture by microalgae but also pushes human
   beings toward sustainable development goals.

AB In this study, an energy, exergy, and environmental (3E) analyses of a
   plasma-assisted hydrogen production process from microalgae is
   investigated. Four different microalgal biomass fuels, namely, raw
   microalgae (RM) and three torrefied microalgal fuels (TM200, TM250, and
   TM300), are used as the feedstock for steam plasma gasification to
   generate syngas and hydrogen. The effects of steam-to-biomass (S/B)
   ratio on the syngas and hydrogen yields, and energy and exergy
   efficiencies of plasma gasification (?En,PG, ?Ex,PG) and hydrogen
   production (?En,H2, ?Ex,H2) are taken into account. Results show that
   the optimal S/B ratios of RM, TM200, TM250, and TM300 are 0.354, 0.443,
   0.593, and 0.760 respectively, occurring at the carbon boundary points
   (CBPs), where the maximum values of ?En,PG, ?Ex,PG, ?En,H2, and ?Ex,H2
   are also achieved. At CBPs, torrefied microalgae as feedstock lower the
   ?En,PG, ?Ex,PG, ?En,H2, and ?Ex,H2 because of their improved calorific
   value after undergoing torrefaction, and the increased plasma energy
   demand compared to the RM. However, beyond CBPs the torrefied feedstock
   displays better performance. A comparative life cycle analysis indicates
   that TM300 exhibits the highest greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and the
   lowest net energy ratio (NER), due to the indirect emissions associated
   with electricity consumption.

AB The microalgae biofuels life cycle assessments (LCA) present in the
   literature have excluded the effects of direct land use change (DLUC)
   from facility construction under the assumption that DLUC effects are
   negligible. This study seeks to model the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   of microalgae biofuels including DLUC by quantifying the CO2 equivalence
   of carbon released to the atmosphere through the construction of
   microalgae facilities. The locations and types of biomass and Soil
   Organic Carbon that are disturbed through microalgae cultivation
   facility construction are quantified using geographical models of
   microalgae productivity potential including consideration of land
   availability. The results of this study demonstrate that previous LCA of
   microalgae to biofuel processes have overestimated GHG benefits of
   microalgae-based biofuels production by failing to include the effect of
   DLUC. Previous estimations of microalgae biofuel production potential
   have correspondingly overestimated the volume of biofuels that can be
   produced in compliance with U.S. environmental goals.

AB Microalgae-derived biodiesel is considered a highly promising
   next-generation biofuel, as current fossil fuel reserves are being
   depleted and combusted causing GHG emissions. Microalgae are arguably
   the most efficient renewable biofuel source to cover our current and
   future demand without competing for arable land or natural areas rich in
   biodiversity. Microalgae are sunlight-driven organisms that convert CO2
   to starch and a variety of lipids with applications such as biofuels,
   foods, animal feeds and high-value bioactive products. The critical
   parameters affecting species selection for biodiesel production are
   growth rate, lipid content, lipid productivity and fatty acid
   composition. Previous research papers and review articles commonly
   discuss growth parameters of single species, but few report a
   comprehensive comparison of several microalgae and provide data for
   lipid productivity in terms of g m-2 day-1 as done by Huerlimann et al.
   This allows for a direct comparison of microalgal lipid productivity to
   terrestrial production systems; thus making comparisons between
   volumetric and area productivity of lipids possible, which is necessary
   for large-scale production. Distinctively, Huerlimann et al. also study
   the effects of different growth media on lipid production and
   composition during different growth phases.

AB The biotreatment of flue gases with algae cultures is a promising option
   to sequestrate CO2, yet the emission of other greenhouse gases (GHG)
   from the cultures can hamper their environmental benefit. Quantitative
   data on the sequestration potential for CO2and NOxin relation to the
   direct production of CH4and N2O are urgently required. The present study
   assessed the flows of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) through cultures of
   the green algaDunaliella salina, supplied with biodiesel flue gas, by
   means of mass balancing.D. salinawas grown in artificially lighted,
   field- (42-L bubble column reactor) and laboratory-scale cultures (23°C,
   pH 7.5). In the bubble column reactor, algae grew with an average
   specific growth rate of 0.237 day-1under flue gas supplementation (6.3%
   (v/v) CO2, 1.2 ppmv NOx), and CO2was retained to 39% in the system. The
   specific sequestration rate for CO2was low, with 0.13 g CO2L-1day-1.
   Cultures emitted up to 13.03 g CH4L-1day-1and 4261 g N2O L-1day-1. The
   moderate retention of NOx-N was outweighed by emissions of N2O-N, and
   total N in the system decreased by 15.48% during the 9-day trial.
   Results suggest that GHG production was mainly the outcome of anaerobic
   microbial processes and their emission was lower in pre-sterilized
   cultures. Under the tested conditions, up to six times more
   CO2equivalents were emitted during flue gas treatment. Therefore, the
   direct GHG emissions of algae culture systems, intended for flue gas
   treatment (i.e. open ponds) need to be reviewed critically.

AB Background: Microalgae-based high-density fuels offer an efficient and
   environmental pathway towards decarbonization of the transport sector
   and could be produced as part of a globally distributed network without
   competing with food systems for arable land. Variations in climatic and
   economic conditions significantly impact the economic feasibility and
   productivity of such fuel systems, requiring harmonized technoeconomic
   assessments to identify important conditions required for commercial
   scale up. Methods: Here, our previously validatedTechno-economic and
   Lifecycle Analysis(TELCA) platform was extended to provide a direct
   performance comparison of microalgae diesel production at 12
   international locations with variable climatic and economic settings.
   For each location, historical weather data, and jurisdiction-specific
   policy and economic inputs were used to simulate algal productivity,
   evaporation rates, harvest regime, CapEx and OpEx, interest and tax
   under location-specific operational parameters optimized for Minimum
   Diesel Selling Price (MDSP, US$ L-1). The economic feasibility,
   production capacity and CO2-eqemissions of a defined 500 ha algae-based
   diesel production facility is reported for each. Results: Under a
   for-profit business model, 10 of the 12 locations achieved a minimum
   diesel selling price (MDSP) under US$ 1.85 L-1/ US$ 6.99 gal-1. At a
   fixed theoretical MDSP of US$ 2 L-1(US$ 7.57 gal-1) these locations
   could achieve a profitable Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 9.5-22.1%.
   Under a public utility model (0% profit, 0% tax) eight locations
   delivered cost-competitive renewable diesel at an MDSP of < US$ 1.24
   L-1(US$ 4.69 gal-1). The CO2-eqemissions of microalgae diesel were about
   one-third of fossil-based diesel. Conclusions: The public utility
   approach could reduce the fuel price toward cost-competitiveness,
   providing a key step on the path to a profitable fully commercial
   renewable fuel industry by attracting the investment needed to advance
   technology and commercial biorefinery co-production options.
   Governments' adoption of such an approach could accelerate
   decarbonization, improve fuel security, and help support a local
   COVID-19 economic recovery. This study highlights the benefits and
   limitations of different factors at each location (e.g., climate, labour
   costs, policy, C-credits) in terms of the development of the
   technology-providing insights on how governments, investors and industry
   can drive the technology forward.

AB As a result of the growing global demand for energy, together with the
   depletion of resources and the growing emphasis on mitigating climate
   change and greenhouse gas emissions, an urgent need for an evolution of
   the renewable energy resources has emerged. On the architectural scene,
   we have become accustomed to seeing buildings incorporated with
   photovoltaics and wind turbines. Despite the great contribution of
   biomass as a clean energy producer, the integration of biomass into
   architecture is quite modest and still in its initial phases.
   Microalgae, as a plant-based biomass, can outperform other renewable
   resources with their potential to absorb CO2, recycle wastewater, and
   release O2. The limited experience regarding building-integrated
   microalgae photobioreactors (PBRs) requires shedding light on some
   issues. So, this paper aims to explore the following: (1) the proper
   types of PBRs for integration with buildings, (2) the overall bioprocess
   and the design considerations regarding PBRs and their technical
   requirements, (3) the environmental and energetic performance of PBRs,
   (4) their challenges, and (5) their prospects. Thus, the paper's
   methodology consists of (1) reviewing the promulgated literature
   concerning microalgae and PBRs, (2) reviewing and analyzing three
   building-integrated PBRs and three urban-integrated PBRs, and (3)
   reviewing the environmental and energetic performance of
   building-integrated PBRs. The paper has concluded that the symbiosis
   between PBRs and facades encounters some challenges, including (1) the
   biorefinery infrastructure, (2) the provision of a source of CO2, and
   (3) the high initial cost. On the other hand, the multifaceted
   environmental prospects of building-integrated PBRs are represented in
   (1) energy savings; (2) GHG emissions reduction; (3) oxygen and hydrogen
   release; (4) biofuel production; and (5) wastewater treatment. The
   unique benefits of the bio-facades through the combination of the
   technical and biological cycles within buildings inaugurate an
   innovative approach to sustainability by integrating environmental,
   energetic, and iconic values.

   microalgae enables to treat dairy wastes and mitigate CO2 for
   sustainable dairy economy. This study developed a biochemical process
   for organic whey with minimum dilution to avoid environmental burden. To
   make whey suitable for algae cultivation, it was pre-treated to remove
   polymers, unwanted solid fractions, opacity, and organic and inorganic
   overloads via acid hydrolysis, chemical flocculation and struvite
   formations with lowest dilution possible. 40% pretreated whey was most
   productive for biomass and lipid fractions respectively 4.54 and 1.80
   gl-1 with daily productivities 0.50 and 0.20 gl-1d-1, however 25% to
   reach adequate treatment. Overall, biochemical treatment was effective
   to remove respectively 99.7 and 91-100% of organic and inorganic
   pollutants, however algal treatment alone exhibited maximum 92.6 and
   48.5-98.4% removals from both treatment ratios which is promising
   finding of this work.

AB Effects of three different cell pretreatment methods on microalgae
   Isochrysis sp. pyrolysis kinetics, biocrude yields and quality, energy
   conversion efficiency and life cycle assessment (LCA) were investigated.
   From derived thermogrametry (DTG) curves, the decomposition reaction was
   apparently enhanced for acid pretreatment sample at 200°C. The
   activation energy of pretreated microalgae pyrolysis was lower than that
   without pretreatment. The biocrude yields for raw microalgae were higher
   than pretreated samples at 450-475°C and lower at 400-425°C. Carbon
   distributions of biocrude from microalgae pyrolysis with ultrasonication
   and microwave pretreatment were similar and mainly in C6-10, C16, C18,
   and C20, while carbon distribution of biocrude from acid pretreatment
   mainly located in C7, C16, C18, and C20. Acid heating pretreatment
   improved fuel quality including N compounds reduction and increase of
   esters and ethers content, which was likely due to esterification
   reaction between carbohydrate derivative and lipid at acid conditions.
   From the point of energy conversion efficiency, pretreatment decreased
   the energy ratio and energy efficiency and increased the energy
   consumption/output ratio ECR (except ECR of acid heating pretreatment)
   during microalgae pyrolysis process. Based on the LCA, pretreatment
   increased the GHG emissions in the production process of alternative
   biofuels. Co-use of pretreatment process during biofuel production and
   valuable chemicals extraction can be further researched to enhance
   energy efficiency and cost-efficiency for microalgae.

AB Extreme accession in industrialization and urbanization is responsible
   for huge demand of fossil fuels which are depleting day by day. Hence,
   search for renewable energy resource has become a considerable challenge
   in recent years. Biodiesel has been recognized as an alternative fuel,
   non-toxic and biodegradable which is capable to replace the diesel fuel.
   In developing countries such as India, there is crisis of edible oil and
   the edible oil is imported to accomplish the demand. Based on the
   outline presented, it is observed that search for biodiesel sources
   should consider the feedstocks that do not require fertile land, do not
   compete with food crop, help in reduction of greenhouse gas emission as
   well as decrease the dependency on other nations. So, recently
   microalgae have emerged to be very auspicious feedstock for production
   of biodiesel. The present study deals with the systematic analyses of
   energy demand and GHG emission statistics of various nations as well as
   all the steps involved in overall process from algal strain selection to
   biodiesel production. With these challenges, the solutions in biodiesel
   production from microalgae were also shown. Though, biodiesel is
   economically viable, more inquisition as well as technological
   evolvement is required in this direction. To overcome these problems,
   policies based on usage of bio fuels derived by various nations which
   encourage biodiesel production, making them rival of conventional energy
   sources are needed.

AB Cultivation of microalgae using wastewater has received considerable
   attention around the globe as a platform to remove inorganic nutrients
   from the wastewater and producing microalgae biomass for biodiesel
   production. This can be done by converting freely available nutrients
   from the wastewater (particularly nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) into
   microalgae biomass with concomitant carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration
   via photosynthesis process. In fact, microalgae biodiesel could help to
   reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere through the
   replacement of fossil diesel as it is made from renewable resources.
   Despite the various benefits to produce microalgae biodiesel, a number
   of technical hurdles such as complex processes, requirement of high
   energy input during cultivation and dewatering (harvesting steps) need
   to be addressed for commercialization purpose. Besides, additional
   pre-treatment step is necessary to disrupt the microalgae cell wall to
   enhance lipid extraction efficiency. Hence, this paper is aims to reveal
   in-depth analysis and discussions on the process of microalgae-based
   wastewater treatment as well as microalgae cells disruption technology
   for lipid extraction. The paper also includes several new directions for
   technological improvements to improve commercialization potential of
   microalgae biodiesel.

   serve as renewable and ecologically sound substitutes to fossil fuels.
   In the United States, corn grain (Zea mays) ethanol is the primary
   biofuel, with over 49 billion liters produced in 2010. Along with the
   Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 mandate, concerns
   about competition for food, land availability, nutrient and water
   requirements, energy balances, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have
   prompted researchers to investigate other potential feedstocks. These
   include second-generation lignocellulosic feedstock and third-generation
   biodiesel from microalgae and cyanobacteria. However, each feedstock
   option has associated benefits and consequences for its use. One
   technique used to evaluate the energy efficiency of bioenergy production
   systems is the life-cycle assessment (LCA), where system inputs and
   outputs are computed in terms of either C or energy equivalents to
   assess the net gains in energy or C offsets. This article collates and
   synthesizes information about feedstock production options. Results show
   a wide range of calculated energy and GHG balances, even for the same
   feedstock species. Discrepancies in LCA and uncertainty thus make direct
   comparisons difficult and prevent a consensus in determining feedstock
   suitability. Recommendations must be based upon LCA model assumptions,
   crop species, cultivation methods, management practices, and energy
   conversion choices. Currently lignocellulosic feedstock, while a better
   alternative than corn grain, is not a long-term viable energy source.
   New feedstocks and technologies are necessary if bioenergy is to be
   C-neutral and efficient in energy production and land use. Although C
   fluxes are considered in LCA, one important ecosystem C stock that has
   previously been left out of many LCA models is changes to soil organic
   carbon (SOC). Future research, developments, and priorities are
   discussed for options to produce low C fuel sources and stabilize the
   climate.

AB In spite of tremendous efforts and huge investments on resources,
   biodiesel from oleaginous microalgae has not yet become a commercially
   viable and sustainable alternative to petro-diesel. This is mainly
   because of the technological and economic challenges hovering around
   large scale cultivation and downstream processing of algae, water and
   land usage, stabilized production technology, market forces and
   government policies on alternative energy and carbon credits. This
   review attempts to capture and analyse the global trends and
   developments in the areas of biofuel and bio-product of microalgae and
   proposes possible strategies that can be adopted to produce biofuel,
   biochar and bio-products utilizing wastewater in a bio-refinery model.
   The strategies include "Zero waste discharge" concept with process
   integration, wherein microalgae is grown strategically using different
   wastewater combined with flue gas in cultivation system for simultaneous
   production of 'high-value-low-volume' product and
   'low-value-high-volume' product with sharing of the remnant biomass to
   produce biochar. In addition, the CO2 present in the atmosphere is
   captured and sequestered long term in the form of biochar would help to
   attain carbon negativity, while remediating wastewater and balancing
   energy requirements. Therefore, "Zero waste discharge" concept holds the
   potential to make the process a sustainable one, while gaining on the
   carbon credits.

AB Under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme in Ireland, the biofuels
   penetration rate target for 2013 was set at 6% by volume from a previous
   4% from 2010. In 2012 the fuel blend reached 3%, with approximately 70
   million L of biodiesel and 56 million L of ethanol blended with diesel
   and gasoline, respectively. Up to and including April 2013, the current
   blend rate in Ireland for biodiesel was 2.3% and for bioethanol was 3.7%
   which equates to approximately 37.5 million L of biofuel for the first
   four months of 2013. The target of 10% by 2020 remains, which equates to
   approximately 420 million L yr-1. Achieving the biofuels target would
   require 345 ktoe by 2020 (14,400 TJ). Utilizing the indigenous biofuels
   in Ireland such as tallow, used cooking oil and oil seed rape leaves a
   shortfall of approximately 12,000 TJ or 350 million L (achieving only
   17% of the 10% target) that must be either be imported or met by other
   renewables. Other solutions seem to suggest that microalgae (for
   biodiesel) and macroalgae (for bioethanol) could meet this shortfall for
   indigenous Irish production. This paper aims to review the
   characteristics of algae for biofuel production based on oil yields,
   cultivation, harvesting, processing and finally in terms of the European
   Union (EU) biofuels sustainability criteria, where, up to 2017, a 35%
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction is required compared to fossil
   fuels. From 2017 onwards, a 50% GHG reduction is required for existing
   installations and from 2018, a 60% reduction for new installations is
   required.

AB The world's biodiesel demand is rising from day to day due to the
   urgency to tackle fuel crisis, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and
   climatic changes in the near future. This alternative energy will
   minimize the dependency on fossil fuels while guarantees a continuous
   energy supply and upholds the ecosystem sustainability. Malaysia, as a
   developing country is still finding a suitable green energy source to
   support the national daily energy consumption without affecting the
   political stability and socio-economic background. In this article, a
   realistic effort made by applying microalgal biotechnology for biodiesel
   production and concurrently mitigating CO2 and other flue gases in the
   presence of tertiary wastewater. Microalgae produce high amount of
   biomass feedstock in a short time with less amount of land capacity by
   using wastewater as the medium to grow. Malaysia is producing variable
   wastes from both agro-industrial and industrial sectors that can be
   recycled as a nutrient supply for microalgae. Wastewater that is
   available in Malaysia comprises high nutrient value compounds that have
   high amount of nitrogen and phosphorus. The current trend in Malaysia in
   the biodiesel industry as well as the application of microalgae as a
   superlative feedstock to replace conventional methods and boost future
   biodiesel industries are well elaborated in this article. This also
   includes the opportunities and challenges of Malaysia in cultivating
   microalgae with stronger technical feasibility and higher turnout in the
   economy by using the high rate algal pond (HRAP). Apart from that, this
   review paper illustrates the process of converting waste from five
   different sources in biofuel production by using microalgae as the
   intermediate tool.

U1 2

AB Microalgae-based biofuels have the potential to replace fossil fuels and
   contribute towards carbon sequestration. However, the growth of this
   industry is challenged by the financial viability of scale-up at various
   production stages. Dewatering is a critical stage which accounts for
   20-30% of biofuels' production costs, therefore a techno-economic
   assessment of two dewatering cases was conducted. The first case was a
   conventional clarifier-centrifuge dewatering system (Case 1), while the
   second case investigated a single stage dewatering approach, using the
   wet-end of a paper machine (Fourdrinier former; Case 2). Mass and energy
   balances were modelled at a process scale of 175 t/d to produce biomass
   with 25% dry substance content, from which the associated costs were
   calculated. The minimum selling price (MSP) to achieve a return of 12%
   at a corporate tax rate of 30% over a 20-year plant life, was
   AU$354.28/t and AU$59.68/t for Case 1 and Case 2 respectively.
   Electricity cost was 90% of operational expenditure for two-stage
   dewatering and 38% for single stage. Case 2 made a better investment
   case with an annual profit after tax of AU$131,020 and net present value
   (NPV) of AU$164 million, as against that of Case 1 with an annual profit
   after tax of AU$112,610 and NPV of AU$71 million. The single stage
   dewatering deserves further investigation to fully explore the cost
   reduction potentials. The adoption of low cost technologies with reduced
   energy use implies lower embedded GHG emissions and process costs when
   compared to conventional technologies. This is desired for the near-term
   actualization of sustainable and clean production pathways for
   microalgae based biofuels.

AB In this paper, we assess what is known or anticipated about
   environmental and sustainability factors associated with next-generation
   biofuels relative to the primary conventional biofuels (i.e., corn
   grain-based ethanol and soybean-based diesel) in the United States
   during feedstock production and conversion processes. Factors considered
   include greenhouse (GHG) emissions, air pollutant emissions, soil health
   and quality, water use and water quality, wastewater and solid waste
   streams, and biodiversity and land-use changes. Based on our review of
   the available literature, we find that the production of next-generation
   feedstocks in the U.S. (e.g., municipal solid waste, forest residues,
   dedicated energy crops, microalgae) are expected to fare better than
   corn-grain or soybean production on most of these factors, although the
   magnitude of these differences may vary significantly among feedstocks.
   Ethanol produced using a biochemical or thermochemical conversion
   platform is expected to result in fewer GHG and air pollutant emissions,
   but to have similar or potentially greater water demands and solid waste
   streams than conventional ethanol biorefineries in the U.S. However,
   these conversion-related differences are likely to be small,
   particularly relative to those associated with feedstock production.
   Modeling performed for illustrative purposes and to allow for
   standardized quantitative comparisons across feedstocks and conversion
   technologies generally confirms the findings from the literature.
   Despite current expectations, significant uncertainty remains regarding
   how well next-generation biofuels will fare on different environmental
   and sustainability factors when produced on a commercial scale in the
   U.S. Additional research is needed in several broad areas including
   quantifying impacts, designing standardized metrics and approaches, and
   developing decision-support tools to identify and quantify environmental
   trade-offs and ensure sustainable biofuels production.

U2 15
AB This study evaluated the environmental and economic impacts of
   substituting synthetic media with greywater for cultivating microalgae
   in the biofuel production process. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   technoeconomic assessment (TEA) were employed to compare the impacts of
   two scenarios - one containing bold's basal (BB) media and another
   containing greywater as growth mediums for microalgae cultivation.
   Scenarios 1 and 2 mitigated 1.74 and 2.14 kg CO2per kg of biofuel
   production, respectively. Substituting BB media with greywater resulted
   in a 16.3% reduction in energy requirements, leading to a 79.3% increase
   in net energy recovered. LCA findings demonstrate a reduction in all
   seven environmental categories. TEA reveals that, despite a 21.7% higher
   capital investment, scenario 2 proves more economically viable due to a
   39.8% lower operating cost and additional revenue from wastewater
   treatment and carbon credits. The minimum selling price of biofuel
   dropped from Rs 73.5/kg to Rs 36.5/kg, highlighting the economic and
   environmental advantages of substituting BB media with greywater in
   microalgal biofuel production.

AB It is of great knowledge nowadays that the use of fossil fuels is
   responsible for the emission of gases that intensify the greenhouse
   effect, which threatens the survival of the humankind. The gravity of
   this fact could be mitigated through the indirect use of solar energy
   for fuels derived from vegetable that can be planted and cultivated by
   the world of renewable and non-polisher. Microalgae play an important
   role in this regard, as they have promising characteristics as potential
   raw material for the production of biofuels, able to absorb large
   amounts of CO2. Chlorophyll organisms convert these simple substances in
   the atmosphere, absorbing sunlight into chemical energy stored, that is,
   compounds with high energy, biomass can also be used to obtain
   biocompounds human nutritional supplement and food animal, however, have
   been found an important number of difficulties to economically viable
   production like high cost of production of dry biomass and oil
   extraction. Here, we review the main approaches of biorefinery concept
   appearing as an alternative to achieve economic viability of the
   production of bio-diesel based on microalgae. The major points are the
   following: (1) use of re-residual water, (2) marketing of Carbon
   Credits, and (3) development of co-products resulting from high value
   added.

   responsible for one third of the carbon emissions in sugarcane
   biorefineries. A possible solution is to replace it with biodiesel from
   lipids, directly produced from sugarcane by highly productive
   heterotrophic microalgae. In this study a heterotrophic microalgae
   biodiesel plant, integrated with a typical Brazilian sugarcane
   bio-refinery, was designed and evaluated. Molasses, steam, and
   electricity from sugarcane processing were used as inputs for microalgae
   production. For a non-integrated plant, the production cost of the
   microalgae biodiesel was estimated at 2.51 and 2.27 $/liter for
   fed-batch and continuous processes, respectively. Equipment for
   cultivation and carbon sources was the highest cost affecting the
   financial feasibility of the proposed design. For the integrated plant,
   at present ethanol and biodiesel selling prices, the profitability would
   be lower than a first-generation sugarcane bio-refinery using fossil
   diesel fuel for its operations. However, the CO2emissions would be
   reduced by up to 50 000 * 103kg per year at a cost of $83
   10-3kg-1CO2-eq. If carbon credits are considered, the process becomes
   economically profitable even at present fuel prices.

AB The potential of microalgae as feedstock for methane production is
   evaluated from a process technical and economic point of view.
   Production of mixed culture algae in raceway ponds on non-agricultural
   sites, such as landfills, was identified as a preferred approach. The
   potential of straightforward bio-methanation, which includes
   pre-concentration of microalgae and utilization of a high rate anaerobic
   reactor was examined based on the premises of achievable
   up-concentration from 0.2-0.6 kg m-3 to 20-60 kg dry matter (DM) m-3 and
   an effective bio-methanation of the concentrate at a loading rate of 20
   kg DM m-3 d-1. The costs of biomass available for bio-methanation under
   such conditions were calculated to be in the range of Euro86-Euro124
   ton-1 DM. The levelized cost of energy by means of the process line
   "algae biomass - biogas - total energy module" would be in the order of
   Euro0.170-0.087 kWh-1, taking into account a carbon credit of about
   Euro30 ton-1 CO2(eq).

AB The environmental feasibility of microalgal energy systems is often
   evaluated through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. In
   particular, biodiesel derived from the transesterification of microalgal
   oil has been extensively assessed following a life-cycle perspective.
   When making comparisons between these LCA studies, the consistency of
   the methodological choices should be a key requirement to guarantee the
   reliability of the comparative results and interpretations. However, a
   harmonised LCA framework is not typically found in the scientific
   literature when addressing comparative studies. In this work, the carbon
   footprint of microalgal biodiesel is revisited for a sample of 31 LCA
   case studies in order to allow a reliable comparative study. As a key
   outcome, a harmonised LCA framework is defined with focus on consistent
   methodological choices regarding functional unit, system boundaries,
   multifunctionality approach, and CO2 balance approach. Furthermore, the
   application of this novel framework leads to the provision of a library
   of 31 robust carbon footprints of microalgal biodiesel. This
   harmonisation initiative proves to mitigate potential misinterpretation
   concerns by avoiding methodological inconsistencies. In fact, all the
   LCA methodological aspects harmonised in this work are found to play a
   significant role in mitigating misinterpretation risk. For instance,
   when benchmarking greenhouse gas emission savings with respect to fossil
   diesel, a robust comparative study using harmonised carbon footprints
   results in a significant reduction in the percentage of case studies
   meeting a 60% target. This highlights the relevance of LCA harmonisation
   when it comes to facilitating decision-making processes under
   sustainability and cleaner productions aspects.

U2 24
AB Microalgae are a promising renewable resource with high biomass yields.
   They can grow in non-potable water and do not compete with the use of
   agricultural land. The environmental sustainability of processing
   microalgae biomass in hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to obtain
   biopetroleum and co-products was evaluated using the life cycle
   assessment technique. The cultivation step in open raceway ponds was
   considered in scenarios with nutrient availability for high protein
   content (HP) biomass and with nutrient limitation for high carbohydrate
   content (HC) and high lipid content (HL) biomass for the
   speciesScenedesmus acutus(SC),Chlorella vulgaris(CV) andNannochloropsis
   granulata(NG), followed by harvesting and HTL processing. The biomass
   productivity in the evaluated scenarios was 18 g (m2day)-1on average
   over the year. The reference flow of 1 kg of microalgae biomass (in
   total solids) processed in HTL and the biopetroleum yield were used to
   estimate the results for 1 kg biopetroleum from HTL. The ecoinvent 3.6
   database and assessment methods for cumulative energy demand (CED) in
   megajoules (MJ) and global warming potential (GWP of IPCC-2021 for 100
   years) in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2eq) were used in
   openLCA 1.11.0. The most favorable scenario was NG-HL with the lowest
   energy demand and carbon footprint, respectively, 19 MJ kg-1and 0.85 kg
   CO2eq kg-1of biopetroleum and the highest biopetroleum yield (68% w/w)
   with a higher heating value (HHV) of 42 MJ kg-1. SC-HP achieved the
   highest energy demand and carbon footprint due to the larger supply of
   fertilizers. The energy return on investment (EROI in MJ MJCED-1) ranged
   from 0.8 to 2.2 in the evaluated scenarios. The sensitivity analysis of
   the cultivation period from early (2 days) to late (7.5 days) harvesting
   time increased the energy demand by 85% and the carbon footprint by 70%
   in NG-HL. The heat demand in HTL is a key parameter in the energy and
   environmental performance of biopetroleum production, which ranged from
   -19% to 30% in the sensitivity analysis of the evaluated categories when
   changing from 5.7 MJ kg-1biomass in HTL to 3-10 MJ kg-1. Therefore,
   microalgae biomass composition control, nutrient demand, harvesting time
   and HTL heat should be optimized to increase the competitiveness of HTL
   biopetroleum on a commercial scale, while reducing the energy demand and
   carbon footprint.

AB Sustainability evaluation of wastewater treatment helps to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions, as it emphasizes the development of green
   technologies and optimum resource use rather than the end-of-pipe
   treatment. The conventional approaches for treating acid mine drainages
   (AMDs) are efficient; however, they need enormous amounts of energy,
   making them less sustainable and causing greater environmental concern.
   We recently demonstrated the potential of immobilized acid-adapted
   microalgal technology for AMD remediation. Here, this novel approach has
   been evaluated following emergy and carbon footprint analysis for its
   sustainability in AMD treatment. Our results showed that imported energy
   inputs contributed significantly (>90%) to the overall emergy and were
   much lower than in passive and active treatment systems. The microalgal
   treatment required 2-15 times more renewable inputs than the other two
   treatment systems. Additionally, the emergy indices indicated higher
   environmental loading ratio and lower per cent renewability, suggesting
   the need for adequate renewable inputs in the immobilized microalgal
   system. The emergy yield ratio for biodiesel production from the
   microalgal biomass after AMD treatment was >1.0, which indicates a
   better emergy return on total emergy spent. Based on greenhouse gas
   emissions, carbon footprint analysis (CFA), was performed using default
   emission factors, in accordance with the IPCC standards and the National
   Greenhouse Energy Reporting (NGER) program of Australia. Interestingly,
   CFA of acid-adapted microalgal technology revealed significant
   greenhouse gas emissions due to usage of various construction materials
   as per IPCC, while SCOPE 2 emissions from purchased electricity were
   evident as per NGER. Our findings indicate that the immobilized
   microalgal technology is highly sustainable in AMD treatment, and its
   potential could be realized further by including solar energy into the
   overall treatment system.

   response to these challenges, this paper explores the potential of
   integrating microalgal biotechnology with renewable energy systems
   within buildings. This innovative approach could transform architecture
   into a "bio-factory" capable of producing food, energy, and other
   valuable products. The success of this concept hinges on developing
   highly efficient photobioreactors specifically designed for building
   integration. Optimizing these systems requires careful consideration of
   design parameters, growth rate models, and factors influencing
   performance within diverse urban environments. Furthermore, integrating
   these systems must prioritize productivity and aesthetics to promote
   urban self-sufficiency and a sustainable built environment. By utilizing
   microalgae and renewable energy sources, building-integrated
   photobioreactors offer a promising solution for reducing energy
   consumption and carbon footprints in modern buildings.

U2 13
AB The aim of this work was to perform a life-cycle analysis of the
   production process of a fungicide based on amphidinols. Two scenarios
   were evaluated: (1) biorefinery process -biofungicide, fatty acids and
   carotenoids were considered as co-products-, and (2) biofungicide as
   only product. Inventory data were taken and scaled-up from previous work
   on pilot-scale reactors, as well as lab-scale downstream equipment. A
   yearly production of 22,000 L of fungicide, was selected as the
   production objective. Despite, photosynthetic biomass is a sink of
   anthropogenic CO2, harvesting and downstream processing have large
   carbon footprints that exceed the biomass fixed carbon. Producing the
   biofungicide resulted in 34.61 and 271.33 ton of CO2e (15 years) for the
   Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Different commercial agricultural
   fungicides were compared with the microalgal fungicide. A lower impact
   of the microalgal product for most of the indicators, including carbon
   footprint, was shown.

U1 3
U2 94
AB Biohydrogen is a plausible alternative fuel solution for the
   contemporary issues regarding global warming and the steadily increasing
   greenhouse gas emissions, because of its high energy content and
   carbon-free combustion properties. Hydrogen does not exist in its
   natural state and the current hydrogen production technologies (steam
   methane reforming, water splitting) are energy-intensive, accompanied by
   a huge carbon footprint. Dark fermentative hydrogen production by
   anaerobic hydrogen-producing bacteria is a green, sustainable and
   emission-free pathway for hydrogen production. Microalgal biomass is
   considered as the third generation biofuel feedstock and is receiving
   academic and industrial research attention for its carbon sequestration
   abilities. This review discusses in detail about the pretreatment
   methods that could be adapted for microalgal biomass for effective
   biohydrogen production. Microalgal cell wall structure and the
   associated polymeric carbohydrates that offer certain recalcitrance are
   critically analyzed and future research perspectives are presented.

U2 37
AB Algal oil as an alternative to fossil fuel has attracted attention since
   the 1940s, when it was discovered that many microalgae species can
   produce large amounts of lipids. Economics and energy security were the
   motivational factors for a spurt in algae research during the 1970s,
   1990s, and early 2000s. Whenever crude prices declined, research on
   algae stopped. The scenario today is different. Even given low and
   volatile crude prices ($30-$50/barrel), interest in algae continues all
   over the world. Algae, with their cure-all characteristics, have the
   potential to provide sustainable solutions to problems in the
   energy-food-climate nexus. However, after years of effort, there are no
   signs of algae-to-biofuel technology being commercialized. This article
   critically reviews past work; summarizes the current status of the
   technology; and based on the lessons learned, provides a balanced
   perspective on a potential path toward commercialization of algae-to-oil
   technology.

PS 8670-8677
PY 2010
U1 2
U2 94
AB Ethanol can be produced via an intracellular photosynthetic process in
   cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), excreted through the cell walls,
   collected from closed photobioreactors as a dilute ethanol-in-water
   solution, and purified to fuel grade ethanol. This sequence forms the
   basis for a biofuel production process that is currently being examined
   for its commercial potential. In this paper, we calculate the life cycle
   energy and greenhouse gas emissions for three different system scenarios
   for this proposed ethanol production process, using process simulations
   and thermodynamic calculations. The energy required for ethanol
   separation increases rapidly for low initial concentrations of ethanol,
   and, unlike other biofuel systems, there is little waste biomass
   available to provide process heat and electricity to offset those energy
   requirements. The ethanol purification process is a major consumer of
   energy and a significant contributor to the carbon footprint. With a
   lead scenario based on a natural-gas-fueled combined heat and power
   system to provide process electricity and extra heat and conservative
   assumptions around the ethanol separation process, the net life cycle
   energy consumption, excluding photosynthesis, ranges from 0.55 MJ/MJEtOH
   down to 0.20 MJ/MJEtOH, and the net life cycle greenhouse gas emissions
   range from 29.8 g CO2e/MJEtOH down to 12.3 g CO2e/MJEtOH for initial
   ethanol concentrations from 0.5 wt % to 5 wt %. In comparison to
   gasoline, these predicted values represent 67% and 87% reductions in the
   carbon footprint for this ethanol fuel on a energy equivalent basis.
   Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions can be further reduced
   via employment of higher efficiency heat exchangers in ethanol
   purification and/or with use of solar thermal for some of the process
   heat.

AB The utilization of renewable energy sources in the pyrolysis process for
   bio-oil production has garnered renewed attention. Solar pyrolysis
   presents a promising avenue for harnessing solar energy, transforming
   biomass energy into a portable and storable fuel. However, the formation
   of undesirable components necessitates upgrading bio-oil before it can
   be effectively employed as a fuel. In this study, ex-situ catalytic
   solar pyrolysis of microalgae is conducted, employing Mg-Al hydrotalcite
   precursor and zeolite as catalysts. The impact of different catalyst
   ratios on Schizochytrium limacinum pyrolysis properties, product yields,
   and characteristics was investigated under solar radiation. The bio-oil
   produced in the solar pyrolysis presented highly desirable compounds as
   long-chain hydrocarbons (aliphatic and aromatic). The formation of these
   hydrocarbons was more favored at the highest reaction temperature of
   750°C, at a ratio of NiHTC/(NiHTC + NiHZSM-5) of 0.50 and under a ratio
   of catalysts/biomass of 4:1, a condition that also led to an
   aromatization of approximately 80% of the hydrocarbons. Just as
   hydrocarbon production was benefited under these conditions, which also
   led to an energy recovery efficiency (ERS) of approximately 65%. These
   data represent 3357 g CO2 eq/GJ for the bio-oil of the present study
   compared to the 70331 g CO2 eq/GJ generated by fossil fuel usage, which
   can assist in reducing fuels' carbon footprint.

AB Recent development in strategies to overcome the environmental
   adversities are focused mainly on lowering the carbon footprints and to
   decrease the global temperature rise. Bioprocesses based on microalgae
   are promising due to a large spectrum of possible products, like
   platform chemicals, proteins and higher value products that can directly
   impart a fall in the carbon emission. Another promising approach towards
   sustainability is the integrated bio refinery cultivation of microalgae
   for waste water treatment with simultaneous production of fuels (alcohol
   and biodiesel), high value chemicals (Astaxanthin, Lutein,
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), monounsaturated fatty acids
   (MUFA)etc.), proteins etc, but the technology readiness level are rather
   low and therefore are not established. However, for sustainable,
   economical and feasible bioprocess strategies using microalgae intra and
   extracellular bio-components extraction and cell wall disruption
   techniques should be optimized whereas challenges like high energy
   consumption involving these stages in the process makes it futile. The
   efficiency of cell disruption techniques and product extraction varies
   within different microalgae and depends mainly on the growth conditions
   and cell wall composition. The current review describes the cell wall
   structure and its composition of green freshwater microalgae such as
   Botryococccus braunii, Scenedesmus obliquus, Desmodesmus sp.,
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris, Haematococcus pluvialis
   and marine forms like Dunaliella salina and Nannocholoropsis gaditana.
   Further, it highlights the green cell lysis technologies to disrupt cell
   walls and the future perspectives and challenges of algae in integrated
   wastewater treatment, CO2 capture, and energy-efficient algal cell wall
   disruption for utilizing microalgae for fuel production is discussed.

AB With the aim to alleviate the increasing plastic burden and carbon
   footprint on Earth, the role of certain microbes that are capable of
   capturing and sequestering excess carbon dioxide (CO2) generated by
   various anthropogenic means was studied. Cyanobacteria, which are
   photosynthetic prokaryotes, are promising alternative for carbon
   sequestration as well as biofuel and bioplastic production because of
   their minimal growth requirements, higher efficiency of photosynthesis
   and growth rates, presence of considerable amounts of lipids in
   thylakoid membranes, and cosmopolitan nature. These microbes could prove
   beneficial to future generations in achieving sustainable environmental
   goals. Their role in the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as a
   source of intracellular energy and carbon sink is being utilized for
   bioplastic production. PHAs have emerged as well-suited alternatives for
   conventional plastics and are a parallel competitor to
   petrochemical-based plastics. Although a lot of studies have been
   conducted where plants and crops are used as sources of energy and
   bioplastics, cyanobacteria have been reported to have a more efficient
   photosynthetic process strongly responsible for increased production
   with limited land input along with an acceptable cost. The biodiesel
   production from cyanobacteria is an unconventional choice for a
   sustainable future as it curtails toxic sulfur release and checks the
   addition of aromatic hydrocarbons having efficient oxygen content, with
   promising combustion potential, thus making them a better choice. Here,
   we aim at reporting the application of cyanobacteria for biofuel
   production and their competent biotechnological potential, along with
   achievements and constraints in its pathway toward commercial benefits.
   This review article also highlights the role of various cyanobacterial
   species that are a source of green and clean energy along with their
   high potential in the production of biodegradable plastics.

AB Gaseous and liquid anaerobic digestion (AD) streams, currently are at
   best used for electricity and heat production or simply spreading at the
   fields, respectively. However, electricity and heat are economically
   produced from other renewables and advanced fertilizers are needed to
   avoid leaching and boost nutrients capture. Hence, AD seeks new
   opportunities to support circular bioeconomy. The overall objective of
   this review is to present state-of-the-art resource recovery routes for
   upcycling the AD streams to reduce carbon footprint and formulate
   alternative products to increase sustainability. Technical barriers and
   integrated systems to upcycle AD streams through biological means are
   presented. New technologies and methods to capture CH4, CO2 and
   nutrients from the digested residual resources are presented, as (a)
   methanotrophs cultivation to be used as feed ingredients; (b) CO2
   conversion and micro-nutrients capturing from microalgae to be valorized
   for a wide range of applications (e.g. biofuels, food and feed,
   fertilizers, bioactive compounds); (c) CO2 transformation to
   biodegradable plastics precursors (e.g. Polybutylene succinate,
   Polyhydroxyalkanoate); (d) digestate valorization for biochar production
   to support efficient agricultural usage. Moreover, the environmental
   factors and life cycle assessment perspectives of the novel biorefinery
   routes are revised highlighting the need for regionalized models or
   assessments that can reveal the most sustainable routes based on local
   conditions and requirements. Despite AD poses some positive
   characteristics related to environmental benefit and emissions
   reduction, the present work reveals that the novel routes can further
   enhance sustainability metrics supporting circular bioeconomy.

AB Overexploitation of natural resources to meet human needs has
   considerably impacted CO2emissions, contributing to global warming and
   severe climatic change. This review furnishes an understanding of the
   sources, brutality, and effects of CO2emissions and compelling
   requirements for metamorphosis from a linear to a circular bioeconomy. A
   detailed emphasis on microalgae, its types, properties, and cultivation
   are explained with significance in attaining a zero-carbon circular
   bioeconomy. Microalgal treatment of a variety of wastewaters with the
   conversion of generated biomass into value-added products such as
   bio-energy and pharmaceuticals, along with agricultural products is
   elaborated. Challenges encountered in large-scale implementation of
   microalgal technologies for low-carbon circular bioeconomy are discussed
   along with solutions and future perceptions. Emphasis on the suitability
   of microalgae in wastewater treatment and its conversion into alternate
   low-carbon footprint bio-energies and value-added products enforcing a
   zero-carbon circular bioeconomy is the major focus of this review.

AB Microalgae oil can be converted into aviation fuel to reduce dependence
   on fossil fuels and decrease the carbon footprint. This could be a
   significant step toward sustainable energy resources that have the
   potential to produce 'drop-in' fuels. Algae-based fuels are potential
   substitutes for fossil fuels due to the quality of their crude oil.
   However, this is only possible if appropriate conversion processes are
   undertaken. Conversely, microalgae species have low lipid content and
   biomass harvesting is still an energy-demanding process. In this study,
   a conceptual design is developed for the conversion of microalgae oil to
   jet fuel. It is based on a process undertaken in the laboratory using a
   species namedNannochloropsissp. Nutrients and CO2were supplied to the
   growing culture for effective growth. Biomass harvesting was completed
   on the tenth day of the growth cycle. It was followed by physiological
   modification to improve lipid content. Finally, crude oil extraction was
   followed by bio-oil hydrocracking at 350°C, and fractionation of cracked
   bio-oil between 70 and 300°C to separate light-, middle-, and heavy-end
   hydrocarbons for use in the production of jet fuel. During simulation,
   reforming and upgrading processes were added to the design to enhance
   the quality of the jet fuel to be produced on large scale in the future.
   The study, including the results, suggests that it is technically
   feasible to convert microalgae oil into jet fuel because of the
   similarity between algae bio-oil and petroleum crude oil.

AB According to the EU Directive, the so-called RED II, there is increasing
   significance for biofuels produced from biomass with low indirect land
   use change (ILUC) risk. Such an alternative and sustainable feedstock
   could be microalgae, among others, used for biodiesel production. This
   is due to the high lipid content of their cells and their potential
   ability to accumulate significant amounts of carbon dioxide in their
   biomass, which has a positive effect on the carbon footprint of the
   product. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of adding
   algal biodiesel to conventional diesel fuel on selected performance
   parameters of a diesel engine, taking into account the composition of
   the emitted exhaust gas. Energy-related engine performance parameters
   such as power, hourly and specific fuel consumption, engine thermal
   efficiency, and indicated efficiency were determined. No significant
   differences were found in the energy parameters of engine operation with
   the fuels tested. In terms of carbon monoxide and NOx emissions, at the
   highest engine torque, more favorable parameters were obtained for fuel
   with biodiesel produced from rapeseed oil (B/RME). Under the same
   conditions, carbon dioxide emissions for the fuel with the addition of
   biodiesel from microalgae (B/Algae) were 8.1% lower.

AB The last decade has seen an emergence of biofuels owed in part to social
   and political acknowledgement that fossil fuels are a finite resource.
   This is evidenced by a reduction in the discovery of new fossil fuel
   sources and the exploitation of more energy intense reserves such as
   shale gas and tar sands. As a result of this reality, biofuel research
   and development has progressed through several stages globally and
   within Canada. First and second generation bioethanol production
   currently dominates the market, leading to concerns over sustainability
   while only partially addressing the issue at hand. Third generation
   biofuel feedstocks, derived from microalgae and cyanobacteria, present
   the potential to address the short falls of both first and second
   generation feedstocks. Specifically, third generation biofuels offer
   increased productivity and the opportunity to sequester nutrients from
   waste streams whilst also expanding the biofuel pallet to include
   biodiesel, as well as other target compounds. However, third generation
   feedstocks remain a young technology that presents several limitations,
   including the lack of a complement of suitable traits within a single
   species. Moreover, common assumptions over the use of waste streams to
   improve productivity and sustainability may limit scalability. These, in
   turn, may limit development or dictate smaller regionally located
   processes. The presented manuscript demonstrates that in spite of their
   potential, mandates and funding support for third generation biofuel
   feedstocks are largely overlooked within Canada, a factor that may
   severely limit future Canadian biofuels research, and the development of
   technologies to address future carbon emissions.

U1 4
U2 21
AB Microalgae-derived biomass is currently considered a sustainable
   feedstock for making biofuels, including biodiesel and direct combustion
   fuel. The photoautotrophic cultivation of microalgae using flue gas from
   power plants has been continuously investigated to improve the economic
   feasibility of microalgae processes. The utilization of waste CO2from
   power plants is advantageous in reducing carbon footprints and the cost
   of carbon sources. Nonetheless, the sudden interruption of CO2supply
   during microalgal cultivation leads to a severe reduction in biomass
   productivity. Herein, chemical fertilizers including urea and KH2PO4were
   added to the culture medium when CO2supply was halted. Urea (5 mM) and
   KH2PO4(5 mM) were present in the culture medium in the form of
   CO2/NH4+and K+/H2PO4-, respectively, preventing cell growth inhibition.
   The culture with urea and KH2PO4supplementation exhibited 10.02-fold
   higher and 7.28-fold higher biomass and lipid productivity,
   respectively, compared to the culture with ambient CO2supply due to the
   maintenance of a stable pH and dissolved inorganic carbon in the medium.
   In the mass cultivation of microalgae using flue gas from coal-fired
   power plants, urea and KH2PO4were supplied while the flue gas supply was
   shut off. Consequently, the microalgae were grown successfully without
   cell death.

AB The rapidly increasing population and climate change pose a great threat
   to our current food systems. Moreover, the high usage of animal-based
   and plant-based protein has its drawbacks, as these nutritional sources
   require many hectares of land and water, are affected by seasonal
   variations, are costly, and contribute to environmental pollution.
   Single-cell proteins (SCPs) are gaining a lot of research interest due
   to their remarkable properties, such as their high protein content that
   is comparable with other protein sources; low requirements for land and
   water; low carbon footprint; and short production period. This review
   explores the use of food waste as a sustainable feedstock for the
   advancement of SCP processes. It discusses SCP studies that exploit food
   waste as a substrate, alongside the biocatalysts (bacteria, fungi,
   yeast, and microalgae) that are used. The operational setpoint
   conditions governing SCP yields and SCP fermentation routes are
   elucidated as well. This review also demonstrates how the biorefinery
   concept is implemented in the literature to improve the economic
   potential of "waste-to-protein" innovations, as this leads to the
   establishment of multiproduct value chains. A short section that
   discusses the South African SCP scenario is also included. The technical
   and economic hurdles facing second-generation SCP processes are also
   discussed, together with future perspectives. Therefore, SCP
   technologies could play a crucial role in the acceleration of a
   "sustainable protein market", and in tackling the global hunger crisis.

AB Biofuels are environmentally friendly, renewable, and have a low carbon
   footprint. Industrial-scale production technologies for advanced
   generation biofuels, though not yet fully mature, are developing fast.
   This paper critically reviews the sources and production technologies of
   promising feedstock, covering sustainability criteria and certification
   for the biofuel products. The trends and perspectives of advanced
   biofuels including techno-economic and policy analysis are discussed and
   examined to evaluate future development. The biofuel properties are
   directly influenced by feedstock compositions and manufacturing
   processes. The wide exploitation and application of lignocellulose
   feedstocks are dominant steps for providing sufficient alternative fuel
   in global biofuel market. The application potentials of major algae
   strains for advanced biofuel production are critically analyzed. New
   types of biofuel should be globally recognized by sustainability
   criteria and certification. The development of advanced conversion and
   purification techniques to increase the economic value of byproducts
   enhances the competitiveness of biofuels. Microalgae and cyanobacteria
   are considered the most promising feedstocks for various types of
   advanced biofuel. Genetic modification of algae or bacterial strains and
   co-cultivation of various microorganisms are found to be effective for
   growing the required chemical compounds and satisfying the required fuel
   characteristics. In addition, thermochemical and biochemical conversions
   are found to be two of the most competitive processes for the production
   of advanced generation biofuels. A review of the current government
   policies shows that the most promising policy tools for biofuel
   development are mandating fuel blending ratios, tax exemption, subsidies
   for processing equipment and materials, and regulations on land use
   change.

AB The study evaluates alternative and innovative arrangements for
   processing a microalgae biomass by anaerobic digestion to produce
   biogas. Cell wall limits bio-accessibility of microalgal intracellular
   compounds, demanding pretreatment to improve methane yield. Two
   pretreatments are evaluated at 75°C using residual heat: thermal (1 bar)
   and thermomechanical (20 bar), which increased biogas production in 40%
   and 159%, respectively. Thermomechanical pretreatment is coupled to the
   following downstream processing cases: (i) biomethane; (ii)
   bioelectricity; (iii) biomethane with enhanced oil recovery; (iv)
   bioelectricity with enhanced oil recovery and (v) pressurized anaerobic
   digestion (6 bar) for biomethane with enhanced oil recovery. Processes
   are compared in three dimensions: energy, economic and carbon footprint.
   Such a framework including upstream and downstream processes, besides
   comparison of atmospheric and pressurized anaerobic digestion, with
   in-depth economic analysis, configures the main novelties of this work.
   Resource utilization efficiency metrics point advantage of pressurized
   anaerobic digestion case, while indicate biomethane production as less
   efficient than bioelectricity. When carbon dioxide post-combustion
   capture and enhanced oil recovery are applied to abate bioelectricity
   emissions, bioelectricity loses competitiveness to biomethane due to
   high energy penalties. Sensitivity of Net Present Value to varying
   carbon taxation (increasing costs), Capture & Trade mechanism and
   enhanced oil recovery (adding revenues) show superior resilience of
   biomethane with enhanced oil recovery. In base scenario conditions,
   where 30US$/GJ electricity is applied, maximum biomass costs to economic
   feasibility for cases (i) to (v) are 50, 21, 100, 5 and 83US$/t
   (dry-basis), respectively. Priced at 50US$/GJ, the bioelectricity
   production frontier to feasibility starts at biomass costs 150US$/t.

U2 157
AB Current agricultural and food production practices are facing extreme
   stress, posed by climate change and an ever-increasing human population.
   The pressure to feed nearly 8 billion people while maintaining a minimal
   impact on the environment has prompted a movement toward new, more
   sustainable food sources. For thousands of years, both the macro
   (seaweed and kelp) and micro (unicellular) forms of algae have been
   cultivated as a food source. Algae have evolved to be highly efficient
   at resource utilization and have proven to be a viable source of
   nutritious biomass that could address many of the current food
   production issues. Particularly for microalgae, studies of their
   large-scale growth and cultivation come from the biofuel industry;
   however, this knowledge can be reasonably translated into the production
   of algae-based food products. The ability of algae to sequester CO2lends
   to its sustainability by helping to reduce the carbon footprint of its
   production. Additionally, algae can be produced on non-arable land using
   non-potable water (including brackish or seawater), which allows them to
   complement rather than compete with traditional agriculture. Algae
   inherently have the desired qualities of a sustainable food source
   because they produce highly digestible proteins, lipids, and
   carbohydrates, and are rich in essential fatty acids, vitamins, and
   minerals. Although algae have yet to be fully domesticated as food
   sources, a variety of cultivation and breeding tools exist that can be
   built upon to allow for the increased productivity and enhanced
   nutritional and organoleptic qualities that will be required to bring
   algae to mainstream utilization. Here we will focus on microalgae and
   cyanobacteria to highlight the current advancements that will expand the
   variety of algae-based nutritional sources, as well as outline various
   challenges between current biomass production and large-scale economic
   algae production for the food market.

AB The effective utilization of biomass and waste streams has drawn
   significant attention in light of the energy crisis and requirement for
   carbon footprint reduction. This study aimed to characterize the
   pyrolytic behaviors, drivers, kinetics, in-situ evolved gases
   characteristics, bio-oils, bio-chars, and product distributions of the
   de-oiledNannochloropsissp. residue (NSR) and waste tires (WT) via
   TG-FTIR-MS and Fixed bed reactor. The D(TG) analysis of the co-pyrolysis
   was characterized by two decomposition stages: the first stage was the
   degradation of NSR (150-350°C), and the second stage (350-550°C) was
   ascribed to the degradation of NSR-WT blends. The discrepancy in
   experimental and theoretical weight loss (DeltaW) was less than zero for
   the blends containing 80, 60, and 50% NSR when the temperature exceeded
   210°C, which confirmed the existence of a strong synergistic effect. The
   average activation energy (Eavg) was 167.37 kJ/mol and 221.79 kJ/mol for
   the NSR and WT devolatilization, respectively. To gain more insight into
   the pyrolytic performance, solid, liquid, and gas products were analyzed
   by different analytical techniques. The results revealed that the
   co-pyrolysis significantly modified the chemical composition of bio-oil,
   leading to an increase in bio-oil yield up to 48.96 wt%. Meanwhile, it
   seemed conceivable to modify the structure and improve the quality of
   bio-oils and biochar by co-pyrolysis. This work provides a practical and
   theoretical understanding of optimizing energy generation, emission
   control, and products recovery during the co-pyrolysis process.

AB There have been many difficulties in supplying CO2for the mass
   production of microalgae, which are regarded as a sustainable source of
   various bio-materials and biofuels. Bicarbonate-based microalgae
   cultivation may offer an alternative way, circumventing the exceedingly
   large energy demands for gas compression and the low carbon utilization
   efficiency of the conventional CO2-based cultivation. To realize this
   bicarbonate-based approach, this study first demonstrated the ability of
   nine microalgae to utilize bicarbonate as a carbon source and determined
   their optimal culture conditions with bicarbonate, such as bicarbonate
   concentration, temperature, and light intensity. Furthermore, to make
   this bicarbonate-based cultivation practical, this study proposed a
   potential novel combination of microalgae cultivation and
   electrochemical CO2mineralization process, which can provide sodium
   bicarbonate (NaHCO3) from flue gas in an eco-friendly manner. Besides,
   potential benefits of using NaHCO3as a carbon source were
   assessedviacarbon footprint analysis from the perspective of the entire
   process, ranging from carbon source preparation to microalgae
   cultivation. This analysis, though rough in nature, revealed that
   bicarbonate can be more advantageous than raw flue gas or
   monoethanolamine (MEA)-extracted pure CO2with respect to net
   CO2emissions and algal biomass productivity. These benefits were even
   more pronounced when the transport of carbon sources was considered. A
   low carbon outgassing rate of maximum 9.6 ppm day-1and a substantially
   high carbon utilization efficiency of > 86.7% with bicarbonate were
   found to be the determining factors. All these supported that the
   bicarbonate-based cultivation of microalgae is indeed feasible and
   practical, in particular when integrated with the electrochemical
   CO2mineralization technology.

AB Co-use of coal with biomass does not only help reduce the carbon
   footprint from coal-based energy generating systems but also creates
   opportunities of improving the synthesis of liquid fuels and valuable
   chemicals via simple pyrolysis processes. Co-pyrolysis of a low-grade
   coal and algal biomass was performed in a rotary kiln with the aim of
   assessing the effect of coal/algae blending ratio and kiln temperature
   on the yield and composition of the resultant oils. Current industrial
   continuous pyrolysis units operate at intermediate pyrolysis heating
   rates, as such, the rotary kiln used in this study operated in the
   heating rates range of 100 - 500°C/min. For a given reactor temperature,
   the yield of pyrolysis oil increased with an increase in algae loading.
   For example, at 550°C, the yields from coal, coal/algae (90/10),
   coal/algae (80/20), coal/algae (60/40) and pure algae were 6.9%, 9.6%,
   15.1%, 16.3% and 40%, respectively. The oil synthesised from coal
   contained a high proportion of paraffins. On the other hand, the oil
   synthesised from algal biomass contained a high proportion of fatty acid
   esters (28.8 - 32.6%) and alcohols (17.6 - 20.8%). The oil synthesised
   from coal-algae blends contained compounds found in both coal and algae
   oils with an increased proportion of PAH and PANHs. It was found that
   for pyrolysis of all samples, an increase in the reactor temperature
   resulted in an increase in concentration of PAH and PANHs.

AB Different harvested process can be decreased the costs of microalgae
   growth, to remove nutrients and improve the carbon cycle. Promising
   process for the conversion of biomass to fuel or bio-crude oil has been
   used for the better quality bio-oil. Hydrothermal liquefaction is
   promising process for the aquatic biomass conversion, as it has been
   operated in the presence of high moisture in the biomass. Catalytic
   hydrothermal liquefaction of ozone-air flotation for harvesting
   microalgae grown in wastewater was investigated for bio-crude
   production. The effect different reaction parameters in the catalytic
   HTL on the distribution of bio-crude and hydrocarbons was experimentally
   evaluated using microalgae grown in wastewater, and harvested by
   ozone-air flotation and gravity-sedimentation, respectively.
   Hydrothermal liquefaction was carried out under water solvent at
   temperature range of 300-350°C, reaction times (30-120 min) and ZSM-5
   and MCM-41 catalyst with different catalysts amount. The bio-crude
   yields obtained from non catalytic and catalytic bio-oil yield range of
   17.3-39.7 wt%. Maximum bio-oil yield (39.7 wt%) was found with ZSM-5
   catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction process. Using ZSM-5 catalysts the
   production of hydrocarbon yield was doubled compared to the
   non-catalytic and MCM-41 catalytic HTL reaction. After HTL reaction the
   obtained bio-oil has been utilization was analyzed to understand Net
   Energy Ratio value and the carbon footprint. It has been found that
   harvested microalgae catalytic HTL bio-oil significantly decreased
   greenhouse gas emissions compared to the conventional grow microalgae
   HTL bio-oil. The deamination and deoxygenation reactions were observed
   in the tests without catalyst as the temperature increased and improved
   with ZSM-5 catalyst, resulted decreasing the content of N and O in the
   bio-oil.

AB The environmental sustainability of aquaculture wastewater treatment by
   microalgal bacterial flocs (MaB-flocs) in an outdoor raceway pond was
   analyzed using life cycle assessment. Pikeperch aquaculture wastewater
   treated at pilot scale (Belgium; 28 m2) and industrial scale
   (hypothetical up-scaling; 41 ponds of 245 m2) were compared. The
   integration of the MaB-floc raceway pond in a broader aquaculture waste
   treatment system was studied, comparing the valorisation of MaB-flocs as
   shrimp feed and as biogas. Up-scaling improves the resource footprint of
   the plant (848 MJex,CEENEkg-1MaB-floc TSS at pilot scale and 277
   MJex,CEENEkg-1MaB-floc TSS at industrial scale) as well as its carbon
   footprint and eutrophication potential. At industrial scale, the
   valorisation of MaB-flocs as shrimp feed is overall more sustainable
   than as biogas but improvements should be made to reduce the energy use
   of the MaB-floc raceway pond, especially by improving the
   energy-efficiency of the pond stirring system.

AB Microalgae are source of third generation biofuel having the key
   advantage of high lipid productivity. In recent times, biorefinery is
   seen as promising option to further reduce the production cost of
   microalgae biofuel. However, exact energy balance analysis has not been

   biorefinery routes, all based on lipid based biorefinery route are
   evaluated for economical production of microalgal biofuel and valorised
   products. Biorefinery route 1 involves production of biodiesel,
   pigments, and animal feed. Biorefinery route 2 involves biogas and
   pigments production and two stage fermentation, and third biorefinery
   route involves bio-hydrogen and pigments production. Finally, the
   technoeconomic assessment of three biorefinery routes were reviewed, net
   energy savings, and life-cycle costing approaches to economize
   microalgal biorefinery are suggested.

AB Microalgae are the main source of third-generation biofuels because they
   have a lipid content of 20-70%, can be abundantly produced and do not
   compete in the food market besides other benefits. Biofuel production
   from microalgae is a promising option to contribute for the resolution
   of the eminent crisis of fossil energy and environmental pollution
   specially in the transporting sector. The choice of lipid extraction
   method is of relevance and associated to the algae morphology (i.e.,
   rigid cells). Therefore, it is essential to develop suitable extraction
   technologies for economically viable and environment-friendly lipid
   recovery processes with the aim of achieving a commercial production of
   biofuels from this biomass. This review presents an exhaustive analysis
   and discussion of different methods and processes of lipid extraction
   from microalgae for the subsequent conversion to biodiesel. Physical
   methods based on the use of supercritical fluids, ultrasound and
   microwaves were reviewed. Chemical methods using solvents with different
   polarities, aside from mechanical techniques such as mechanical pressure
   and enzymatic methods, were also analyzed. The advantages, drawbacks,
   challenges and future prospects of lipid extraction methods from
   microalgae have been summarized to provide a wide panorama of this
   relevant topic for the production of economic and sustainable energy
   worldwide.

AB The extensive use of fossil fuels is increasingly recognized as
   unsustainable as a consequence of depletion of supplies and the
   contribution of these fuels to climate change by GHG (greenhouse gas)
   emissions into the atmosphere. Microalgae indicate alternative renewable
   sustainable energy sources as they have a high potential for producing
   large amounts of biomass which in turn can be used for production of
   different third-generation biofuels at large scale. Microalgae transform
   the solar energy into the carbon storage products, leads to lipid
   accumulation, including TAG (triacylglycerols), which then can be
   transformed into biodiesel, bioethanol and biomethanol. This paper
   reviews the selection, production and accumulation of target bioenergy
   carrier's strains and their advantages as well as the technological
   development for oil, biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, biogas production and
   GHG mitigation. The feedstock of promising algal strain exhibits the
   suitable biofuel production. The current progress of hybrid-technologies
   (biomass production, wastewater treatment, GHG mitigation) for
   production of prime-products as biofuels offer atmospheric pollution
   control such as the reduction of GHG (CO2fixation) coupling wastewater
   treatment with microalgae growth. The selection of efficient strain,
   microbial metabolism, cultivation systems, biomass production are key
   parameters of viable technology for microalgae-based
   biodiesel-production.

AB Microalgae have gained interest over the century due to numerous
   intrinsic attributes surpassing higher plants, making them a potential
   feedstock for third-generation biofuel production. The current state of
   art technologies produces biodiesel from microalgal biomass attributed
   to high intrinsic neutral-lipid contents. However, persisting hurdles in
   terms of techno-economic feasibility have impeded commercial-scale
   operations. The latent qualities of microalgae towards the accumulation
   of multiple high-value products ranging from animal feed to
   pharmaceuticals adds up to the economic feasibility. Alternatively, the
   high abundant carbohydrate contents of microalgal strains are used as
   low-cost substrates for the growth of commercially important microbes to
   synthesize biofuels. Novel carbohydrate enhancement strategies such as
   two-stage cultivation, phytohormones, starvation strategies,
   combinatorial stress strategies, etc., are frequently emerging to
   mitigate the challenges. Therefore, this study targets to review the
   recent trends in tuning the microalgal metabolism for increased
   carbohydrates and associated biofuel generation to attain process
   feasibility and sustainability. According to recent reports, nitrogen
   limitation, phosphate limitation, the optimal light intensity with
   reduced dissolved oxygen, limited inorganic carbon, optimal organic
   carbon levels, and indole-3-acetic acid augmented the carbohydrate
   productivity in different microalgal strains. Further analysis on
   different pretreatment methods highlighted electric-based physical
   treatment strategies with high efficiencies and less energy requirements
   of 13.3 kJ to 1.5 MJ per kg biomass. The production cost for
   microalgae-based bioethanol varies from US$ 1.67 to 31.36 per gallon for
   different process scenarios, which needs further attention.

AB Microalgae are considered sustainable resources for the production of
   biofuel, feed, and bioactive compounds. Among various microalgal genera,
   the Tetraselmis genus, containing predominantly marine microalgal
   species with wide tolerance to salinity and temperature, has a high
   potential for large-scale commercialization. Until now,Tetraselmissp.
   are exploited at smaller levels for aquaculture hatcheries and bivalve
   production. However, its prolific growth rate leads to promising areal
   productivity and energy-dense biomass, so it is considered a viable
   source of third-generation biofuel. Also, microbial pathogens and
   contaminants are not generally associated withTetraselmissp. in outdoor
   conditions due to faster growth as well as dominance in the culture.
   Numerous studies revealed that the metabolite compositions
   ofTetraselmiscould be altered favorably by changing the growth
   conditions, taking advantage of its acclimatization or adaptation
   ability in different conditions. Furthermore, the biorefinery approach
   produces multiple fractions that can be successfully upgraded into
   various value-added products along with biofuel. Overall,Tetraselmissp.
   could be considered a potential strain for further algal biorefinery
   development under the circular bioeconomy framework. In this aspect,
   this review discusses the recent advancements in the cultivation and
   harvesting ofTetraselmissp. for wider application in different sectors.
   Furthermore, this review highlights the key challenges associated with
   large-scale cultivation, biomass harvesting, and commercial applications
   forTetraselmissp.

AB Alternative fuel technology of third-generation biofuels in place of
   conventional fossil fuels is currently being witnessed at a global
   level. Due to its sustainability and environmental friendliness, in
   recent years more importance is being given to biodiesel in CI engine
   applications. Recent trends show that microalgae are promoted as a
   bio-fuel due to their inherent advantages of abundant availability of
   oil sources and faster growth rate with ease of cultivation. Particular
   species of algae such asChlorella, Botryococcus braunii, andScenedesmus
   obliquusare conventionally favored for biodiesel production as they have
   a prominent amount of lipids content. This review outlines the current
   state of experimental investigations on the use of different algae
   biodiesel blends with diesel for CI engines. Amongst the different
   algae-based biodiesel, the dualCalophyllum Inophyllummethyl ester blend
   (CIME20) with DEE demonstrated the maximum brake thermal efficiency
   (BTE) and better brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of CI engines.
   In terms of emissions, the CO, UBHC, and smoke levels are significantly
   lower for algae blends in contrast to neat diesel.

AB Biodiesel obtained from microalgae is considered a promising alternative
   to conventional diesel fuel. However, it has been proposed that
   cultivation of algae for the sole purpose of making biodiesel is neither
   economically efficient nor sustainable. Nevertheless, there are several
   ways in which microalgae can be utilized to their full potential. One
   possibility is to view the cultivation and utilization of microalgae as
   a complex process that includes wastewater treatment, carbon dioxide
   sequestration, production of nutritional supplements, biofuels etc. The
   aim of this paper is to review the most promising possibilities of
   combining different cultivation strategies/technologies with the
   coproduction of high value products (e.g. Omega-fatty acids) and
   biofuels (algal diesel, ethanol and biogas).

U2 51
AB The depletion of fossil fuels and their serious environmental concerns
   have made renewable energy sources much more attractive. One of the more
   promising renewable energy alternatives is the use of
   second/third-generation biomass that does not endanger food security, to
   produce bioenergy. The biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain design is a
   challenging issue that has attracted the attention of academic and
   industrial research. In this direction, a multi-objective multi-period
   MILP model is developed to design the second/third-generation biofuel
   supply chain using anaerobic digestion and transesterification
   processes. Three types of biomass (i.e. agricultural residues and
   livestock manure, microalgae and Jatropha) simultaneously are studied as
   feedstock to produce clean energy in all climatic and geographic
   conditions, and even in remote areas. Selection of raw material
   resources, location of production facilities, location of warehouses,
   and optimal material flows are the main decisions made by the proposed
   model to minimize the total cost and maximize the produced energy. The
   performance of this model is evaluated and validated through conducting
   a real case study. The results show that considering the amount of
   produced bioenergy regardless to its type, energy production from
   microalgae and Jatropha is more viable than bio-wastes. The results also
   show that production cost (especially biodiesel production cost from
   Jatropha) and investment cost (especially construction costs of
   microalgae and Jatropha to biodiesel production sites) have the most
   effect on the total cost of the supply chain network, respectively.

AB The present study aims to address the following question: compared with
   first and second-generation biofuels, can microalgae biodiesel
   contribute to addressing the sustainability objectives in the transport
   sector in France? To this end, we deployed the range based Multi-Actor
   Multi-Criteria Analysis (range-based MAMCA) methodology that explicitly
   considers the different and occasionally conflicting values of the
   stakeholders (feedstock producers, biofuel producers, refining industry,
   fuel distributors, end-users, car manufacturers, government, and NGOs).
   By means of a Monte Carlo simulation, the method also provides an
   exploratory scenario approach that enables considering uncertainty
   concerning the context evolution and the biofuel impacts by 2030. In our
   case study, we aimed at fostering co-construction with stakeholders into
   the decision-making process by involving them starting from the very
   beginning of the procedure. Assuming a "weak sustainability" (i.e. the
   substitutability between human and environmental capital) our results
   suggest that microalgae biodiesel can contribute to the achievement of
   the sustainability objectives in the transport sector. Preliminary
   policy measures are finally suggested to speeding up the deployment of
   microalgae biodiesel in France. At the overall level, our study provides
   new insights about the capacity of first, second and third generation
   biofuels in fulfilling the sustainability criteria of the different
   stakeholders.

AB Microalgal biodiesel is technically viable to power diesel engines. This
   third-generation biofuel has great performance of combustion and can
   reduce emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, its
   production is currently very expensive, relative to petrochemical
   diesel. Development and implementation of strategies to optimize
   productivity and quality of biomass and thus ensure this future-proof
   biofuel is economically feasible to fabricate and competitive with
   diesel oil on an industrial scale is challenging. This meta-analytic
   overview documents the diversity of fastest-growing, oil-accumulating
   microalgae; performance of cultures and systems; strategies for inducing
   lipids; and quality and economics of microalgal biodiesel. The
   microalgae,Neochloris oleoabundans,Scenedesmus obliquus,Desmodesmussp.,
   andMicractiniumsp., are hyperaccumulators of lipids. The
   genre,Micractiniumsp., is a thermophile, and thus it can resist
   hydrothermal streams. Complementarily, it is the fastest to grow and the
   most productive in both biomass and biodiesel. This should be of great
   importance to roll-out sustainable, high-performance algal systems in
   marginal lands in tropical zones, where the heat often makes the
   planning and management of projects difficult and expensive. Heat shock,
   nutritional starvation, and photoperiod are the most effective
   algae-specific strategies for inducing mechanisms for lipogenesis
   inAnkistrodesmus dimorphus,Chlorella
   vulgarisandLeptolyngbyasp.,Cylindrotheca closteriumandN. oleoabundans,
   andAmphora subtropicaandDunaliellasp., respectively.Rhodococcussp.
   produces a significant amount of biomass at very low cost, relative to
   diesel oil. The concept of synergistically co-culturing microalgae with
   this photosynthetically active bacterium may be an option to save the
   producer the expenditures and uncertainties of third-generation
   biodiesel.

AB Microalgae are a promising new source of biomass for the production of
   third generation biofuels but, so far, the majority of microalgal
   biomass has been used for high-value applications. New low-cost
   technologies are needed to make the production and processing of
   microalgae economically feasible for low-value applications. A major
   challenge lies in the harvesting of microalgae, which requires a
   cost-efficient separation technology. Flocculation, especially
   bioflocculation, is an attractive low-cost separation technology.
   Various new bioflocculation strategies have been claimed to generate
   major advances in cost-efficient harvesting. Here, we review the recent
   advances in bioflocculation based on algal-bacterial, algal-fungal, or
   algal-algal interactions within the framework of microalgae biomass
   harvesting for biofuel production. We also discuss recent advances using
   infochemicals and genetic engineering for the induction of

AB The energy sector faces significant challenges globally, including
   increasing air pollution, rising energy demands, and fluctuating crude
   oil prices. In response, researchers have turned their attention to
   third-generation biofuels derived from algae due to their numerous
   advantages over first (crop-based) and second-generation (petro
   crop-based) biofuels. Microalgae offer faster growth rates, shorter
   regeneration times, the potential to utilize waste lands for
   cultivation, and scalability. However, challenges such as maintaining
   biomass yield while increasing lipid synthesis persist. To address this
   challenge, researchers are employing metabolomic strategies to target
   the lipid production pathway in microalgae. This review provides a
   comprehensive overview of various metabolomic approaches, including gene
   editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9, RNA interference (RNAi), zinc
   finger nucleases (ZFN), and transcription activator-like effector
   nucleases (TALENs), aimed at enhancing lipid synthesis while maintaining
   biomass yield in microalgae. Additionally, the review discusses major
   challenges and the future potential of microalgal-based biofuels.

   Oleaginous microalgae, named for their ability to produce oil, are
   reported to store 30-70% of lipid content due to its metabolic
   properties under nutrient starvation conditions. This review presents
   the assortment of the research studies focused on biofuel production
   from oleaginous microalgae. The new methods and technologies developed
   for oleaginous microalgae cultivation to improve their biomass content
   and lipid accumulation capacity were reviewed. The production of
   renewable, carbon neutral, bio-based or microalgae-based transport fuels
   are necessary for environmental protection and economic sustainability.
   Microalgae are a significant source of renewable biodiesel because of
   their ability to produce oils in the presence of sunlight more
   efficiently than that of crop oils. This review will provide the
   background to understanding the bottlenecks and the need for improvement
   in the cultivation or harvesting process for oleaginous microalgae.

AB The concern regarding alternate sources of energy is mounting day-by-day
   due to the effect of pollution that is damaging the environment. Algae
   are a diverse group of aquatic organisms have an efficiency and ability
   in mitigating carbon dioxide emissions and produce oil with a high
   productivity which has a lot of potential applications in producing
   biofuel, otherwise known as the third-generation biofuel. These third
   generation biofuels are the best alternative to the present situation
   since they have the perspective to eliminate most of the ecological
   problems created by the use of conventional fossil fuels. These
   organisms are responsible for closely 50% of the photosynthesis process
   taking place on the planet and are distributed predominantly in many of
   the aquatic systems. The huge interest in utilizing these organisms as a
   potential source of energy lies in converting the primary as well as
   secondary metabolites into useful products. Algae are considered to be
   the most prominent resource for the upcoming generations as the most
   suitable and sustainable feedstock. The key process limitations in
   microalgal biofuel production are inexpensive and effective harvesting
   of biomass and extraction of lipids. The major objective of this article
   is to provide a comprehensive review on various methods of both biomass
   harvesting and lipid extraction from microalgae available, so far,
   besides to discuss their advantages and disadvantages. This article also
   deals with various conditions that are favourable for lipid accumulation
   as well as the yield from different species.

AB Microalgae are a promising alternative source of oil for biodiesel
   production. Identification of a species with desirable characteristics
   is a key component towards achieving economic feasibility for the
   process. This has been compromised by a lack of data allowing effective
   interspecies comparison. Eleven species of microalgae, selected on the
   basis of available literature data, were tested for lipid productivity,
   gravity sedimentation and the suitability of their fatty acid profiles
   for biodiesel production. The response to nitrogen limitation was
   species-specific. Lipid yields and productivity were higher at 150 mg
   L-1 nitrate than at 1,500 mg L-1 for all species tested except Spirulina
   platensis. The Chlorophyta, particularly Chlorella vulgaris and
   Scenedesmus, had the highest growth rates and showed the greatest
   increase in lipid content in response to nitrogen limitation.
   Cylindrotheca fusiformis, S. platensis, Scenedesmus and Tetraselmis
   suecica had the fastest settling rates and highest biomass recoveries
   after 24 h of gravity sedimentation. For most species, the fuel would
   need to be blended or culture conditions to be optimised to achieve the
   correct lipid profile in order for microalgal fuel to meet the European
   standards for biodiesel production (EN 14214). The most promising
   species overall were the freshwater algae Scenedesmus and C. vulgaris
   and the marine algae C. fusiformis and Nannochloropsis.

AB Due to diminishing petroleum reserves and deleterious environmental
   consequences of exhaust gases from fossil-based fuels, research on
   renewable and environment friendly fuels has received a lot of impetus
   in the recent years. However, the availability of the non-edible crops
   serve as the sources for biofuel production are limited and economically
   not feasible. Algae are a promising alternative source to the
   conventional feedstocks for the third generation biofuel production.
   There has been a considerable discussion in the recent years about the
   potential of microalgae for the production of biofuels, but there may be
   other more readily exploitable commercial opportunities for macroalgae
   and microalgae. This review, briefly describes the biofuels conversion
   technologies for both macroalgae and microalgae. The gasification
   process produces combustible gases such as H2, CH4, CO2and ammonia,
   whereas, the product of pyrolysis is bio-oil. The fermentation product
   of algae is ethanol, that can be used as a direct fuel or as a gasohol.
   Hydrogen can be obtained from the photobiological process of algal
   biomass. In transesterification process, algae oil is converted into
   biodiesel, which is quite similar to those of conventional diesel and it
   can be blended with the petroleum diesel. This study, also reviewed the
   production of high value byproducts from macroalgae and microalgae and
   their commercial applications. Algae as a potential renewable resource
   is not only used for biofuels but also for human health, animal and
   aquatic nutrition, environmental applications such as CO2mitigation,
   wastewater treatment, biofertilizer, high-value compounds, synthesis of
   pigments and stable isotope biochemicals. This review is mainly an
   attempt, to investigate the biorefinery concept applied on the algal
   technology, for the synthesis of novel bioproducts to improve the algal
   biofuels as even more diversified and economically competitive. The
   employment of a high-value, co-product strategy through the integrated
   biorefinery approach is expected to significantly enhance the overall
   commercial implementation of the biofuel from the algal technology.

AB Reducing CO2emissions using biomass is gaining popularity as an
   environmentally friendly strategy. Due to high growth rates, low
   production costs, and ability to withstand harsh conditions, microalgae
   have become quite popular. Microalgae may also undertake photosynthesis,
   converting CO2and solar energy into sugar before becoming biomass,
   making them an excellent source of renewable and promising biofuels.
   CO2sequestration and biofixation was utilized to compare the synthesis
   of biodiesel as a third-generation biofuel from various types of
   wastewater was also used as a source for the algal cultivation. This
   review article focuses on recent developments, research discoveries in
   the field of microalgal CO2capture modification and the optimization of
   conversion efficiency. This review is intended to serve as a helpful and
   reference for the use of wastewater treatment with microalgae to collect
   CO2. The overarching objective of this study is to assist wastewater

AB Algae (especially microalgae and cyanobacteria) are potentially diverse,
   ubiquitous, and dominant group of photosynthetic organisms in nature.
   The dominance and diversity of algae are commonly observed in small
   puddles, streams, river, to oceans and even in extreme habitats like
   cold springs to hot deserts, which makes them a prominent organism for
   various applications. The past decade has evidenced microalgal research
   in bioenergy production and other vital biomolecules with wide
   industrial applications. Further, the easy availability of microalgae
   and cyanobacteria makes them a suitable candidate for various
   biotechnological applications like food, feed, fodder, and fuel. Algae
   are grouped under the third generation biofuel feedstock offering
   numerous environmental benefits viz., efficient land usage,
   CO2sequestration and utilization and most importantly resolving the food
   vs fuel feud. With this perspective, this review article aims to unravel
   the conventional and novel applications of microalgal and cyanobacterial
   biomass in various enterprises and also the recent trends in their
   exploitation. To understand the overall potential of microalgae, at
   inception, this review article has articulated a detailed account of the
   applicability of various algal biomasses for different biofuels such as
   bioethanol, biodiesel, and biohydrogen. As an environmental benefit,
   bioremediation of wastewater or nutrient removal from municipal and
   industrial sources, and pesticide removal using several microalgal
   strains has been critically appraised and presented comprehensively.
   Also, the enormous biodiversity and difference in the biochemical
   composition of microalgae make them stand as a promising source for
   biologically active compounds with high commercial value. In addition to
   energy products from algae, converting the biomasses into various
   industrially important co-products or high value products is an
   economically sound approach. At this juncture, extraction of secondary
   metabolites, carotenoids, phycobiliproteins, phytosterols and phenolic
   compounds from numerous microalgae and cyanobacteria has been discussed
   in detail. Overall, the present review gives a detailed account of the
   biofuel production from algae, bioproducts extraction, environmental
   applications of microalgae, and cyanobacteria for bioremediation.

AB Biofuels have become an attractive energy source because of the growing
   energy demand and environmental issues faced by fossil fuel consumption.
   Algal biomass, particularly microalgae, has excellent potential as
   feedstock to be converted to bio-oil, biochar, and combustible syngas
   via thermochemical conversion processes. Third-generation biofuels from
   microalgal feedstock are the promising option, followed by the
   first-generation and second-generation biofuels. This paper provides a
   review of the applications of thermochemical conversion techniques for
   biofuel production from algal biomass, comprising pyrolysis,
   gasification, liquefaction, and combustion processes. The progress in
   the thermochemical conversion of algal biomass is summarized,
   emphasizing the application of pyrolysis for its benefits over other
   processes. The review also encompasses the challenges and perspectives
   associated with the valorization of microalgae to biofuels ascertaining
   the potential opportunities and possibilities of extending the research
   into this area.

AB The microalgae have the capacity to mitigate CO2emissions and to produce
   lipids, which are considered with potential to obtain third-generation
   biofuel. This review provides updated information of the influence of
   culture conditions on the lipids production with high productivity and
   profile suitable for the biodiesel production. This document presents a
   compilation of research conclusions over the last 13 years around the
   world. In the literature consulted, the authors conclude that although
   the behavior of microalgae at physiological stress conditions, varies
   between species; the nutrients limitation, especially nitrogen and
   phosphorus, associated with heterotrophic growth or high irradiances in
   phototrophy are considered the most efficient strategies to increase the
   lipid content in microalgae, particularly triglycerides (consisting of
   saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids), which are excellent for the
   production of biodiesel. Also, it is reported that the lipid content
   increase and the number of unsaturated fatty acids decrease with the
   addition of small amounts of CO2 and harvesting the biomass it the
   stationary phase of growth.

AB The burning of fossil fuels is an unsustainable activity, which is
   leading to an increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions and related
   global warming. Among sustainable energy sources, microalgae represent a
   promising alternative to fossil fuel and contribute to the achievement
   of important Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, the
   potential contribution of marine microalgae to sustainable development
   is large as, among other benefits, they represent a carbon negative
   energy source and may be applied in many coastal areas around the world.
   Despite this, significant economic and technological improvements are
   needed in order to make microalgae biofuels viable on a large scale.
   This review aims to explore how and to what extent third-generation
   biofuels (marine microalgae, but also the latest advances in freshwater
   microalgae) can benefit the realization of these SDGs. From this study
   we concluded that the production of large-scale marine microalgae
   biofuels is not yet feasible from the economic perspective at a large
   scale. However, the cultivation of microalgae in seawater holds great
   potential for increasing the small to medium viability of this biofuel
   source. The possibilities for improvement along with the contributions
   to sustainable development lay the groundwork for continuing to study
   and apply the potential of sustainable production of microalgae
   bioenergy.

AB Despite many advantages of third-generation biofuels, there are still
   numerous opportunities to improve their production efficiency and
   streamline their commercialization. The unpredictability of cultivating
   biomass is a major challenge to consistent, efficient production. In
   particular, the cultivation of Spirulina platensis biomass for biofuel
   production is affected by various environmental factors such as light,
   temperature, pH and the nutrient concentration of water. Since
   controlling these factors is energy intensive, a biomass prediction
   model would be helpful in anticipating biomass production and in
   indicating necessary adjustments to the process to improve yield. In
   this case, earlier is clearly better. This study developed a machine
   learning-based early prediction model, which identifies the earliest
   time during cultivation that the process parameters such as optical
   density and pH can accurately be used to predict biomass yield. In the
   case study, the early prediction model predicted the final biomass yield
   (on the 23rd day) by the 8th day of cultivation using ridge regression.
   Furthermore, an application of this model in pH control led to a 54.1%
   average improvement in biomass yield. This model may be used to monitor
   cultivation batches allowing problems (i.e. low yield) to be identified
   early. It can also be applied in process simulation and optimization to
   improve biomass yield. In summary, mathematical modelling can make the
   unpredictable biomass process more predictable and improve production
   efficiency.

AB The depletion of fossil fuel for energy production is one of the major
   problems being faced worldwide. As an alternative to fossil fuels, first
   and second generation biofuel was developed from corn, grains and
   lignocellulosic agricultural residues. These generations are inefficient
   in achieving the desired rate of biofuel production, climate change
   mitigation and economic growth. Therefore, third generation biofuel
   specifically derived from microalgae have proved to be a promising
   unconventional energy source. Microalgae are microscopic organisms that
   grow in salt or fresh water and have been used for producing
   metabolites, cosmetics and for energy production. The conventional
   approaches used for biofuel production include pyrolysis, gasification,
   direct combustion and thermomechanical liquefaction. The search for
   biological and eco-friendly approaches led to the emergence of Microbial
   Fuel Cell (MFC), which provide a new solution to energy crisis.
   Integration of photosynthetic organisms such as microalgae into MFC
   resulted in a new approach i.e. Microbial Solar Cell, which can convert
   solar energy into electrical energy via photosynthesis. Microbial solar
   cells have broad range application in wastewater treatment, biodiesel
   processing and intermediate metabolite production.

AB The discharge of the toxic phenol-polluted petro-industrial effluents
   (PPPIE) has severe environmental negative impacts, thus it is mandatory
   to be treated before its discharge. The objective of this review was to
   discuss the sustainable application of microalgae in phenols
   degradation, with a special emphasis on the enzymes involved in this
   bioprocess and the factors affecting the success of PPPIE
   phycoremediation. Moreover, it confers the microalgae bioenergetic
   strategies to degrade different forms of phenols in PPPIE. It also
   points out the advantages of the latest application of bacteria, fungi
   and microalgae as microbial consortia in phenols biodegradation.
   Briefly, phycoremediation of PPPIE consumes carbon dioxide emitted from
   petro-industries for; valorization of the polluted water to be reused
   and production of algal biomass which can act as a source of energy for
   such integrated bioprocess. Besides, the harvested algal biomass can
   feasibly produce; third-generation biofuels, biorefineries, bioplastics,
   fish and animal feed, food supplements, natural dyes, antioxidants and
   many other valuable products. Consequently, this review precisely
   confirms that the phycoremediation of PPPIE is a win-win process for a
   green environment and a sustainable future. Thus, to achieve the three
   pillars of sustainability; social, environmental and economic; it is
   recommendable to integrate PPPIE treatment with algal cultivation. This
   integrated process would overcome the problem of greenhouse gas
   emissions, global warming and climate change, solve the problem of
   water-scarce, and protect the environment from the harmful negative
   impacts of PPPIE.

AB Microalgae are considered to be the feedstock for third-generation
   biofuels but there are still no commercial applications of microalgae
   biomass. This is due to the costly harvesting process, resulting from
   their specific characteristics such as small cell sizes, negatively
   charged surfaces, and stable dispersion in culture broths. Chitosan
   derived from crustacean shells, as a highly efficient and non-toxic
   flocculant for the harvesting of microalgae, can simultaneously achieve
   value-added recycling of shell wastes and efficient flocculation of
   microalgal biomass. Shell-derived chitosan is a biopolymer with a high
   economic value, which might promote shell waste resource utilization.
   Its application for microalgae harvesting also has no effect on the
   downstream process for biodiesel production. More than 90% of microalgal
   biomass can be harvested under certain conditions using chitosan as the
   flocculant, demonstrating a strong potential for practical application
   in future. The application of chitosan to flocculate microalgae still
   has some limitations, and efforts should be made regarding the
   enhancement of cost-effectiveness, improvement of harvesting processes,
   scalability of practical application, and implementation of supporting
   policies. The contribution of this study lies in the combination of
   chitosan production from crustacean shell wastes and its application in
   microalgae harvesting, which can realize the value-added recycling of
   shell wastes and efficient flocculation of microalgal biomass.

PY 2015
U1 21
U2 566
AB Following first-generation and second-generation biofuels produced from
   food and non-food crops, respectively, algal biomass has become an
   important feedstock for the production of third-generation biofuels.
   Microalgal biomass is characterized by rapid growth and high carbon
   fixing efficiency when they grow. On account of potential of mass
   production and greenhouse gas uptake, microalgae are promising
   feedstocks for biofuels development. Thermochemical conversion is an
   effective process for biofuel production from biomass. The technology
   mainly includes torrefaction, liquefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification.
   Through these conversion technologies, solid, liquid, and gaseous
   biofuels are produced from microalgae for heat and power generation. The
   liquid bio-oils can further be upgraded for chemicals, while the
   synthesis gas can be synthesized into liquid fuels. This paper aims to
   provide a state-of-the-art review of the thermochemical conversion
   technologies of microalgal biomass into fuels. Detailed conversion
   processes and their outcome are also addressed.

AB The sugarcane sector in Brazil has undergone a major modernization in
   the last thirty years. Embracing the biorefinery concept, this sector is
   investigating bioproduct diversification and mostly putting a lot of
   effort and investment on second generation ethanol production. In this
   context, the investigation of the integration of a third generation
   biofuel production using microalgae to the sugarcane biorefinery seems
   an important starting point. This study evaluates the integration of
   microalgae growth and processing to a sugarcane biorefinery producing
   first and second generation ethanol using process simulation tools.
   Microalgae are cultivated using CO2produced during fermentation of
   ethanol and it is processed using supercritical fluid extraction
   technology in order to obtain lipids rich in high added-value compounds,
   carotenoids. The results showed that the integration of microalgae
   biomass processing without previously drying with the sugarcane
   biorefinery is not attractive from the thermo-economic point. When
   considering the extraction of dried microalgae the extraction process
   could be thermal integrated to the sugarcane biorefinery producing
   ethanol without the need of buying external fuel. The amount of CO2used
   as solvent to the supercritical fluid extraction was the main factor
   that influenced the economic viability of the process. When microalgae
   pretreatment by cell disruption or co-solvent extraction was considered,
   it was possible to decrease the amount of CO2used in the process and an
   increase in process yields was consequently achieved. The use of a
   co-solvent in the extraction increased in 1.4 and 2.4 times lipids and
   carotenoids extraction, respectively, and presented a lower investment
   when comparing with microalgae extraction without cell disruption.

SO Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
VL 133
PY 2020
U1 5
U2 44
AB The current energy demands continuously lead us to the quest of
   developing alternative energy sources to compete with the depleting
   fossil fuel reserves. In the recent years algae have garnered attention
   as third generation biofuel. However, low biomass concentration and
   metabolite accumulation results in low biofuel yield, thereby limiting
   its application. The present study reviews three possible approaches for
   enhancing biofuel production from algae: biochemical engineering,
   genetic engineering and application of omics/metabolic flux. Biochemical
   engineering depends on changing different physiological conditions such
   as increasing cultivation temperature or applying nitrogen stress to
   route the carbon flux towards metabolite accumulation. Genetic
   engineering exploits the knowledge of the major molecules for metabolite
   accumulation to create recombinant microalgal strains, which
   overexpresses specific enzymes or blocks certain pathways to improve
   metabolism of targeted biomolecules. Omics and flux analysis helps to
   mathematically analyze these manipulations and interpret different
   possible responsesin silico, based on which experiments can be conducted
   in-vivo. Currently biochemical engineering is the most recognized
   technique for metabolite improvement in algae. However, these approaches
   have inhibitions which can be reduced by genetic engineering, metabolic
   flux or omics strategies. It was analyzed that integration of these
   approaches may help us to overcome the current limitations of algal
   biofuel production. The present paper discusses the merits, success
   rates and constraints of each of these approaches. The article
   explicitly discusses how combining these engineering techniques may help
   us to enhance the starch/carbohydrate and the lipid content in algae for
   establishing it as a promising energy feedstock for the future.

AB Background: In recent times, when energy crisis compounded by global
   warming and climate change is receiving worldwide attention, the
   emergence of algae, as a better feedstock for third-generation biofuels
   than energy crops or plants, holds great promise. As compared to
   conventional biofuels feedstocks, algae offer several advantages and can
   alone produce a significant amount of biofuels sustainably in a shorter
   period to fulfill the rising demand for energy. Objective: Towards
   commercialisation, there have been numerous efforts put forward for the
   development of algae-derived biofuel. This article reviews and
   summarizes the recent inventions and the current trends that are
   reported and captured in relevant patents pertaining to the novel
   methods of algae biomass cultivation and processing for biofuels and
   value-added products. In addition, the recent advancement in techniques
   and technologies for microalgal biofuel production has been highlighted.
   Methods: Various steps involved in the production of algal biofuels have
   been considered in this article. Moreover, the work that advances to
   improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the processes for the
   manufacture of biofuels has been presented. Our survey was conducted in
   the patent databases: WIPO, Spacenet and USPTO. Results: There are still
   some technological bottlenecks that could be overcome by designing
   advanced photobioreactor and raceway ponds, developing new and low cost
   technologies for biomass cultivation, harvesting, drying and extraction.
   Conclusion: Recent advancement in algae biofuels methods is directed
   toward developing efficient and integrated systems to produce biofuels
   by overcoming the current challenges. However, further research effort
   is required to scale-up and improve the efficiency of these methods in
   the upstream and downstream technologies to make the cost of biofuels
   competitive with petroleum fuels.

AB Third-generation biofuels that are derived from microalgal biomass have
   gained momentum as a way forward in the sustainable production of
   biodiesel. Such efforts are propelled by the intention to reduce our
   dependence on fossil fuels as the primary source of energy. Accordingly,
   growing microalgal biomass in the form of suspended cultivation has been
   a conventional technique for the past few decades. To overcome the
   inevitable harvesting shortcomings arising from the excessive energy and
   time needed to separate the planktonic microalgal cells from water
   medium, researchers have started to explore attached microalgal
   cultivation systems. This cultivation mode permits the ease of
   harvesting mature microalgal biomass, circumventing the need to employ
   complex harvesting techniques to single out the cells, and is
   economically attractive. However, the main bottleneck associated with
   attached microalgal growth is low biomass production due to the
   difficulties the microalgal cells have in forming attachment and
   populating thereafter. In this regard, the current review encompasses
   the novel techniques adopted to promote attached microalgal growth. The
   physicochemical effects such as the pH of the culture medium,
   hydrophobicity, as well as the substratum surface properties and abiotic
   factors that can determine the fate of exponential growth of attached
   microalgal cells, are critically reviewed. This review aims to unveil
   the benefits of an attached microalgal cultivation system as a promising
   harvesting technique to produce sustainable biodiesel for lasting
   applications.

AB Following the diminishing hopes from the first and second generation
   biofuels, mainly due to the limitations of land availability, feed stock
   requirements, and complicated pre-treatments, third generation biofuels
   from microalgae are becoming a priority in the current scenario. The
   present study focuses on comparison and optimization of lipid
   accumulation efficiency in algal strain Chlorella minutissima grown
   under autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic modes of nutrition,
   employing various carbon sources obtained from cheap industrial wastes
   such as glucose, acetate, and glycerol. Other pertinent factors such as
   the effect of various nitrogen sources, effect of salinity on the cell
   growth, and lipid accumulations in the algal cells were also studied.
   The results suggested that C. minutissima can grow efficiently under
   autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic modes of nutrition. C.
   minutissima cells were capable of utilizing other non-popular carbon
   sources such as glycerol and acetate collected as waste products from
   different industries along with commonly used glucose. The maximum
   biomass concentration (8.9 g/L) and lipid content (36.19%) were found in
   heterotrophic mode of nutrition. Our findings indicated that C.
   minutissima can efficiently utilize these cheaper carbon sources from
   industrial waste products for its growth and the production cost of
   various bioenergy sources can be reduced significantly.

AB Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable resource, a major plant nutrient that
   is essential for modern agriculture. Currently, global food and feed
   production depends on P extracted from finite phosphate rock reserves
   mainly confined to a small number of countries. P limitation and its
   potential socio-economic impact may well exceed the potential effects of
   fossil fuel scarcity. The efficiency of P usage today barely reaches
   20%, with the remaining 80% ending up in wastewater or in surface waters
   as runoff from fields. When recovered from wastewater, either chemically
   or biologically, P is often present in a form that does not meet
   specifications for agricultural use. As an alternative, the potential of
   microalgae to accumulate large quantities of P can be a way to direct
   this resource back to crop plants. Algae can acquire and store P through
   luxury uptake, and the P enriched algal biomass can be used as
   bio-fertilizer. Technology of large-scale algae cultivation has made
   tremendous progress in the last decades, stimulated by perspectives of
   obtaining third generation biofuels without requiring arable land or
   fresh water. These new cultivation technologies can be used for
   solar-driven recycling of P and other nutrients from wastewater into
   algae-based bio-fertilizers. In this paper, we review the specifics of P
   uptake from nutrient-rich waste streams, paying special attention to
   luxury uptake by microalgal cells and the potential application of
   P-enriched algal biomass to fertilize crop soils.

AB The cultivation of microalgae gained high attention within the last
   years because of their potential to substitute conventional bioenergy
   crops. To evaluate algal bioenergy production pathways already at an
   early stage, several life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have been
   performed, but their results and conclusions vary drastically. Against
   this background, this review gives a comparative analysis of 16 recent
   studies. To allow for a comparison, a meta-approach served to uniform
   the considered systems. System boundaries have been equalized and the
   energy return on investment (EROI) has been calculated for each study.
   Depending on the assumptions made on biomass productivity, lipid
   content, required energy, and the output of the system, the energetic
   performance was assessed. Large variations from 0.01 to 3.35 for the
   EROI could be derived.

AB Background: Algal harvesting is a major cost which increases biofuel
   production cost. Algal biofuels are widely studied as third-generation
   biofuel. However, they are yet not viable because of its high production
   cost which is majorly contributed by energy-intensive biomass harvesting
   techniques. Biological harvesting method like fungal-assisted harvesting
   of microalgae is highly efficient but poses a challenge due to its slow
   kinetics and poorly understood mechanism. Results: In this study, we
   investigateAspergillus fumigatus-Chlorella pyrenoidosaattachment
   resulting in a harvesting efficiency of 90% within 4 h. To pinpoint the
   role of extracellular metabolite, several experiments were performed by
   eliminating theC. pyrenoidosaorA. fumigatusspent medium from theC.
   pyrenoidosa-A. fumigatusmixture. In the absence ofA. fumigatusspent
   medium, the harvesting efficiency dropped to 20% compared to >90% in the
   control, which was regained after addition ofA. fumigatusspent medium.
   Different treatments ofA. fumigatusspent medium showed drop in
   harvesting efficiency after periodate treatment (≤20%) and
   methanol-chloroform extraction (≤20%), indicating the role of sugar-like
   moiety. HR-LC-MS (high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry) results confirmed the presence ofN-acetyl-d-glucosamine
   (GlcNAc) and glucose in the spent medium. When GlcNAc was used as a
   replacement ofA. fumigatusspent medium for harvesting studies, the
   harvesting process was significantly faster (p<0.05) till 4 h compared
   to that with glucose. Further experiments indicated that metabolically
   activeA. fumigatusproduced GlcNAc from glucose. Concanavalin A staining
   and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) analysis ofA.
   fumigatusspent medium- as well as GlcNAc-incubatedC. pyrenoidosacells
   suggested the presence of GlcNAc on its cell surface indicated by dark
   red dots and GlcNAc-specific peaks, while no such characteristic dots or
   peaks were observed in normalC. pyrenoidosacells. HR-TEM
   (High-resolution Transmission electron microscopy) showed the formation
   of serrated edges on theC. pyrenoidosacell surface after treatment
   withA. fumigatusspent medium or GlcNAc, while Atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) showed an increase in roughness of theC. pyrenoidosacells surface
   upon incubation withA. fumigatusspent medium. Conclusions: Results
   strongly suggest that GlcNAc present inA. fumigatusspent medium induces
   surface changes inC. pyrenoidosacells that mediate the attachment toA.
   fumigatushyphae. Thus, this study provides a better understanding of
   theA. fumigatus-assistedC. pyrenoidosaharvesting process.

U2 42
AB Fossil fuel limitations and their influence on climate change through
   atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions have made the excessive use of
   fossil fuels widely recognized as unsustainable. The high lipid content,
   carbon-neutral nature and potential as a biofuel source have made
   microalgae a subject of global study. Microalgae are a promising supply
   of biomass for third-generation biofuels production since they are
   renewable. They have the potential to produce significant amounts of
   biofuel and are considered a sustainable alternative to non-renewable
   energy sources. Microalgae are currently incapable to synthesize algal
   biofuel on an extensive basis in a sustainable manner, despite their
   significance in the global production of biofuels. Wastewater contains
   nutrients (both organic and inorganic) which is essential for the
   development of microalgae. Microalgae and wastewater can be combined to
   remediate waste effectively. Wastewater of various kinds such as
   industrial, agricultural, domestic, and municipal can be used as a
   substrate for microalgal growth. This process helps reduce carbon
   dioxide emissions and makes the production of biofuels more
   cost-effective. This critical review provides a detailed analysis of the
   utilization of wastewater as a growth medium for microalgal - biofuel
   production. The review also highlights potential future strategies to
   improve the commercial production of biofuels from microalgae.

U1 0
U2 1
AB Microalgae as a third-generation biofuel source with various advantages
   is a potential part of renewable energy resources. Various studies on
   the conversion process of microalgae into biofuels have been carried
   out, one of which is the thermochemical process. The thermochemical
   conversion process is considered better than the biochemical process
   which has a low conversion rate and higher production costs. Recent
   researches state that to obtain bio-crude oil from microalgae through a
   thermochemical process, there are two alternative technologies that can
   be used, which are pyrolysis and liquefaction. In this research, a
   selection was made to determine which technology was better using
   decision making tools of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The
   evaluation criteria that have been used are technological (readiness
   level, energy efficiency, pre-treatment process, and product output),
   operational complexity, environment, and economy (investment cost and
   operation cost). The alternative technologies evaluated were pyrolysis
   with bubbling fluidized bed reactor, pyrolysis with circulating
   fluidized bed reactor, and hydrothermal liquefaction. From the results
   of pairwise comparisons, the technological criteria had the highest
   weight (0.343) and hydrothermal liquefaction technology was the best
   alternative technology among other alternatives (0.420).

AB Even though microalgal biomass is leading the third generation biofuel
   research, significant effort is required to establish an economically
   viable commercial-scale microalgal biofuel production system. Whilst a
   significant amount of work has been reported on large-scale cultivation
   of microalgae using photo-bioreactors and pond systems, research focus
   on establishing high performance downstream dewatering operations for
   large-scale processing under optimal economy is limited. The enormous
   amount of energy and associated cost required for dewatering
   large-volume microalgal cultures has been the primary hindrance to the
   development of the needed biomass quantity for industrial-scale
   microalgal biofuels production. The extremely dilute nature of
   large-volume microalgal suspension and the small size of microalgae
   cells in suspension create a significant processing cost during
   dewatering and this has raised major concerns towards the economic
   success of commercial-scale microalgal biofuel production as an
   alternative to conventional petroleum fuels. This article reports an
   effective framework to assess the performance of different dewatering
   technologies as the basis to establish an effective two-stage dewatering
   system. Bioflocculation coupled with tangential flow filtration (TFF)
   emerged a promising technique with total energy input of 0.041 kWh, 0.05
   kg CO2 emissions and a cost of $ 0.0043 for producing 1 kg of microalgae
   biomass. A streamlined process for operational analysis of two-stage
   microalgae dewatering technique, encompassing energy input, carbon
   dioxide emission, and process cost, is presented.

AB Production of microalgae as feedstock for biofuels must deal with a
   number of challenges including constraints imposed by local conditions.
   One solution is to use indigenous strains adapted to local climatic
   conditions. The present report describes the isolation, identification,
   and characterization of 32 microalgal strains from different ecological
   habitats: desert freshwater channels, northern region, and saline
   regions of Pakistan. The effects of temperature on algal growth rates,
   biomass productivity, and lipid content were determined through growth
   at 12, 20, and 35°C for 15 days under 2% CO2Responses to temperature
   varied among species with 20°C being the optimum temperature in general,
   although, exceptionally, the best overall growth rate was found for
   strain S29 (0.311 d-1) at 12°C. In some cases high biomass productivity
   was observed at 35°C, and, depending upon the strain, the maximum lipid
   content was obtained at different temperatures, including 12°C. Fatty
   acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis showed that the major fatty acids
   present were palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic. Oleic
   acid (C18:1) was the predominant fatty acid, with the specific FAME
   profile varying with strain. Thus, there is a rich diversity of
   microalgal strains native to Pakistan, some of which, characterized
   here, could be suitable for biodiesel production or other
   biotechnological applications.

AB The environmental sustainability of microalgae-to-biodiesel production
   systems was examined at open (outdoor) and closed (indoor, using
   artificial light and temperature control) raceway ponds in a
   Mediterranean climate (southern Greece).Spirulina
   platensisandNannochloropsissp. species were considered, with the latter
   having a slightly better environmental performance. In terms of energy
   efficiency, large cumulative energy demand (CED) values were observed,
   while the energy return-on-investment (EROI) ratio was well below 3 in
   all cases, indicating that, with current technology, algae-to-biodiesel
   systems have not reached sustainability yet. The impact on land use was
   minimal, as nonarable land was used. Shallow-pond cultivation systems
   are energy intensive, especially the closed ones, and therefore were
   found to be associated with high environmental footprints. In all cases,
   the main environmental hotspot was, by and large, the electricity
   consumption from the Greek fossil-fuel depended energy mix (90%).
   Pellet, a process co-product, largely reduced the total environmental
   footprint by up to 47%, which highlights the importance of co-product
   valorization. Closed systems exhibited significantly higher
   environmental footprints compared to open ones, due to the large energy
   inputs for artificial solar irradiation and for indoor temperature
   control. In all the cases examined, the microalgae-to-biodiesel
   production system's environmental footprint was higher than that of
   fossil diesel (i.e. petrodiesel), indicating that ample room exists to
   improve their environmental performance. A sensitivity analysis revealed
   that the introduction of renewable energy solely to cover for
   electricity needs substantially improves environmental sustainability
   and could render microalgae-to-biodiesel systems an environmentally
   friendlier solution than petrodiesel.

AB Algae are fast growing biomass and can be converted to Biodiesel fuel.
   The demand of biodiesel is growing worldwide. Microalgae need a

   Spirogyra, Chlamydomonas, Botryococcus, Scenedesmus, Neochloris,
   Haematococcus, Nannochloropsis, Ulva species and few species of brown
   algae, red algae, blue green algae were chosen to study the effect of
   temperature and light intensity on their growth. Optimum temperature
   range 20°C to 30°C was observed for growth of different algae species.
   Light irradiance varies between 33 mol m-2 s-1 to 400 mol m-2 s-1.
   Maximum growth rate was found 1.73 d-1 for Selenastrum minutum at 35°C
   and 420 mol m-2 s-1 irradiance. Minimum growth rate (0.10 d-1) was

AB Microalgae produce a variety of compounds that can be used for
   aquaculture, nutraceutical purposes, and third-generation biofuel
   sectors. Moreover, they have been considered for the production of
   fortified food and beverages claiming to be healthier than other foods.
   Using microalgal oil or incorporating microalgae biomass or their
   metabolites in food and beverages provides health benefits due to
   properties such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune-enhancing, and
   to their role against various diseases such as cardiovascular metabolic,
   atherosclerosis, and hypertension. This review focuses on the worldwide
   research carried out about the incorporation of microalgae - either
   biomass or their high-value compounds - in food and beverages, and on
   the microalgal fortified/based food and beverages currently present
   worldwide on the market. The metabolites bioavailability aspect and the
   current legislation are considered. There is an ever-growing interest in
   this field but the volume of production is still limited. Various
   challenges, one of which is the cost of producing biomass, need to be
   overcome for a profitable market. More effort, involving different
   expertise, is needed to improve the microalgal production system, from
   cultivation to harvesting and biorefinery, to produce improved novel
   products.

AB The unicellular, nitrogen fixing cyanobacteriumCyanothecesp. ATCC 51142
   is of a remarkable potential for production of third-generation
   biofuels. As the biotechnological potential ofCyanothece51142 varies
   with the time of the day, we argue that it will, similarly, depend on
   the phase of the culture growth. Here, we study the batch culture
   dynamics to discover the dominant constraints in the individual growth
   phases and identify potential for inducing or delaying transitions
   between culture growth phases inCyanothece51142. We found that specific
   growth rate in the exponential phase of the culture is much less
   dependent on incident irradiance than the photosynthetic activity. We
   propose that surplus electrons that are released by water splitting are
   used in futile processes providing photoprotection additional to
   non-photochemical quenching. We confirm that the transition from
   exponential to linear phase is caused by a light limitation and the
   transition from linear to stationary phase by nitrogen limitation. We
   observe spontaneous diurnal metabolic oscillations in stationary phase
   culture that are synchronized over the entire culture without an
   external clue. We tentatively propose that the self-synchronization of
   the metabolic oscillations is due to a cell-to-cell communication of the
   cyanobacteria that is necessary for nitrogenase activity in nitrate
   depleted medium.

AB Naturally synthesized compounds have an evolving market demand as
   bioactive metabolites with numerous health benefits. In this context,
   microalgae-based bioactive compounds such as pigments and nutraceuticals
   are commercially available, and it is foreseen that the market demand
   would continue to grow due to the recent requirement for natural
   products in the food industry. In particular, the global market for
   microalgae-based proteins is foreseen to reach $ 0.84 billion by 2023,
   whereas the natural blue pigment (c-phycocyanin) is expected to reach a
   market value of $ 409.8 million by 2030. Being a protein-rich
   cyanobacterium (60-70% (w/w)) and a promising source for c-phycocyanin
   (47% of the total proteins), Spirulina has gained attention as a
   promising feedstock for the large-scale production of high-value
   proteins and c-phycocyanin. Even though Spirulina is commercially
   cultivated in many countries, the exclusive production of proteins and
   c-phycocyanin is still emerging. Besides, Spirulina-based biorefinery is
   a promising strategy to enhance the economic viability of the
   large-scale production of proteins and c-phycocyanin. In addition,
   utilization of waste resources in Spirulina-based biorefineries is a
   beneficial strategy in terms of increasing economic feasibility and
   environmental sustainability. The current review focuses on promoting a
   circular bioeconomy via the biorefining of Spirulina to produce protein
   and c-phycocyanin while analyzing the challenges and future perspectives
   associated with the overall process.

AB Microalgae's potential as a third generation biofuel has attracted
   recent attention. Two key methods for obtaining biofuel from microalgae
   are compared and contrasted, namely solvent extraction followed by
   transesterification, producing Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME)
   biodiesel, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to producing biocrude.
   The resulting differences in physicochemical characteristics affect
   engine performance and emissions as well as engine selection. Most
   microalgae engine research has been conducted on high speed diesel
   engines to investigate the performance and exhaust emissions of FAME
   whereas the HTL literature has mostly presumed biocrude would be
   upgraded for similar engines. However, growing awareness of the
   significant contribution of shipping emissions to public health brings
   into focus alternatives to heavy fuel oil (HFO) for low speed diesel
   (marine) engines. Such engines are thermodynamically very similar to
   high speed diesel engines but have the economic advantage that they can
   use low cost, high density fuels such as HFO/HTL. Microalgae FAME
   contains 10.5-11% (wt) oxygen and 36.2-39.2 MJ/kg calorific value,
   (10-15% lower than for petroleum diesel). High speed diesel engines
   tests using microalgae FAME generally decrease particulate emissions
   with a small penalty in engine power owing to the high oxygen content
   and lower Higher Heating Value (HHV). Conversely, biocrude obtained by
   HTL from green freshwater microalgae contained 10-11% (wt) oxygen, 4-8%
   (wt) nitrogen and 32-35 MJ/kg calorific value (20-27% lower than for
   petroleum diesel). HTL biocrude would be expected to reduce emissions
   for low speed marine diesel engines compared to HFO, especially soot
   emissions due to their very low sulphur content, although NOxemissions
   may increase. HTL biocrude may reduce the engine performance (output
   power) compared to HFO due to the higher oxygen content and lower HHV.
   This review' aim is to compare microalgae FAME and HTL biocrude and
   their suitability for diesel engines regarding engine performance and
   emissions.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) of indigenous freshwater microalgae,
   Scenedesmus dimorphus, cultivation in open raceway pond and its
   conversion to biodiesel and biogas were carried out. The LCA inventory
   inputs for the biogas scenario was entirely based on primary data
   obtained from algal cultivation (in pilot scale raceway pond),
   harvesting, and biogas production; while only the downstream processing
   involved in biodiesel production namely drying, reaction and
   purification were based on secondary data. Overall, eight scenarios were
   modeled for the integrated process involving: algae-based CO2 capture
   and downstream processing scenarios for biodiesel and biogas along with
   impact assessment of nutrient addition and extent of recycling in a life
   cycle perspective. The LCA results indicated a huge energy deficit and
   net CO2 negative in terms of CO2 capture for both the biodiesel and
   biogas scenarios, majorly due to lower algal biomass productivity and
   higher energy requirements for culture mixing. The sensitivity analysis
   indicated that variability in the biomass productivity has predominant
   effect on the primary energy demand and global warming potential (GWP,
   kg CO2 eq.) followed by specific energy consumption for mixing algal
   culture. Furthermore, the LCA results indicated that biogas conversion
   route from microalgae was more energy efficient and sustainable than the
   biodiesel route. The overall findings of the study suggested that
   microalgae-mediated CO2 capture and conversion to biodiesel and biogas
   production can be energy efficient at higher biomass productivity (> 10
   g m-2 day-1) and via employing energy-efficient systems for culture
   mixing (< 2 W m-3).

AB Microalgae are promising and sustainable candidates for developing
   biorefineries to obtain valuable bioproducts and bioenergy. However, key
   challenges, such as low biomass production, high-cost harvesting, and
   non-efficient extractions, are restricting its large-scale production.
   Symbiotic relationships between microalgae and cyanobacteria can
   simultaneously mitigate these technical and economic restrictions. This
   research aims to develop sustainable and cost-effective biorefineries
   from two microalgae-cyanobacteria consortia to produce valuable
   ingredients for the cosmetic field (chlorophylls) and bioenergy
   (biogas). Solvent screening and cell disruption experiments were carried
   out to optimise the chlorophyll extraction protocols. Green solvents
   were chosen for both consortia. The mildness method (vortexing) was
   enough to achieve the maximum extraction level of chlorophylls (4.8  0.2
   mg/g) using 96% ethanol from a consortium composed of Chlorella
   vulgaris, Tetraselmis sp., and Kamptonema sp. The use of bead-beating
   was even more effective using water in the case of the consortium of C.
   vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis (13.5  1.1 mg/g). High-potential
   antioxidant chlorophyll extracts were obtained for the cosmetic sector.
   As ethanol traces were found in the residual biomass of the C. vulgaris,
   Tetraselmis sp., and Kamptonema sp. consortium, the highest cumulative
   biomethane production (472  32 mLCH4/gVS) was achieved with this
   residual biomass, the corresponding value for the initial consortium
   being significantly lower (239  32 mLCH4/gVS). The study concludes
   through the overall mass balances of the best biorefineries that it is
   possible to recover up to 100% of both consortia weight as cosmetic
   ingredients, biogas, and fertilisers or cultivation media.

AB While the potential of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae to
   produce biocrude regardless of the types of microalgae
   (biomass-agnostic) has been noted, the quality of biocrude and the
   Energy Return On Investment (EROI) of HTL of various microalgal species
   have not been compared in detail. Here we report that the quality of
   biocrude and the EROI of microalgal HTL are directly dependent on the
   lipid contents of microalgae. WhenNannochloropsis oceanica(30.2% lipid
   content) andGolenkiniasp. (17.3% lipid content) were compared for the
   quality of HTL in terms of the total yield, asphaltene/non-asphaltene
   contents, heteroatom (O, N, and S) concentrations, and the effective
   hydrogen-to-carbon ratios (H/Ceff) of the biocrudes,N. oceanicawith high
   lipid content produced biocrude that can be more suitable for catalytic
   upgrading to transportation fuels than the biocrude fromGolenkiniasp.
   with low lipid content. HTL ofN. oceanicaat low temperature (200°C) in
   particular produced the biocrude with EROI that was better than that
   ofGolenkiniasp. These results strongly support that the choice of
   microalgae with high lipid content is still a key factor that must be
   considered for biocrude production as much as it is regarded important
   for biodiesel production using microalgal biomass.

AB In this work, a solvent-based extraction procedure and a procedure using
   supercritical CO2 to obtain beta-carotene from Dunaliella salina were
   compared from environmental and economic perspectives. Both processes
   were simulated using a biorefinery scheme in which beta-carotene was
   obtained and the waste biomass was used to produce energy. The results
   were used to carry out a life-cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA results
   showed that a supercritical process was better in terms of energy
   consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the low extraction
   yield of this technology makes it necessary to use large amounts of
   nutrients, whose production increases toxicity-related impacts related
   to organic solvent extraction. This also affects the beta-carotene
   price, which is twofold higher in the case of a supercritical extraction
   process-based biorefinery. The results therefore indicate that the
   potential benefits of the supercritical process in terms of
   environmental issues do not balance the drawbacks related to its low
   extraction yield.

AB Studies have reported enhancements in methane yield from pretreatment
   methods that benefit the anaerobic digestion (AD) of microalgae.
   However, energy return on investment (EROI), i.e., methane production
   enhancement achieved over energy input, may be unfavorable. Aiming to
   quantify EROI of AD microalgae pretreatment, about 180 experiments
   applied to 30 microalgae biomasses were compiled through an extensive
   literature survey, classified into 4 pretreatments (physical, enzymatic,
   chemical, and hybrid), and analyzed. Most of these pretreatments
   enhanced methane yield, especially the enzymatic alternative. EROI was
   evaluated for the most efficient pretreatments. Only in one thermal
   pretreatment the energy resulting from the increase in methane
   production exceeded the energy demanded by the biomass pretreatment
   (EROI 6.8) and other two thermal pretreatments presented EROI 1. The
   other pretreatments presented EROI <1, concluding that none of the
   evaluated methods was energy-efficient. Feasibility of pretreatment
   requires advancements in low energy-demanding strategies and outstanding
   biomass densification.

AB Bioethanol is produced from different source, they have their own

   process. In this era ethanol production is not a big approach, but when
   using some renewable source, it may affect in fuel world. This type of

   from algae feedstock are the "third generation" of biofuel to be known
   as one of the most important renewable energy source. Today, global
   demand of ethanol generate the opportunity to explore new renewable
   biomass sources. Microalgae are a promising alternative source of lipid
   for biodiesel production but certain algae are rich in carbohydrates of
   various forms. They provide viable feedstock for fermentation to
   ethanol. Algae have shorter growth cycle as compared to other plant,
   hence the algae is a very promising source of biomass for the production
   of biofuels and also reduce in climate change effects. The review mainly
   focus on research related to the bioethanol production, where the algae
   have acted as a most fast growing supporter of bioethanol and also
   define the bioethanol production potentially higher than other crops.

   obliquusis one of the most potential sources for biodiesel as it has
   adequate fatty acid (linolenic acid) and other polyunsaturated fatty
   acids. Bio-ethanol is already in the market of United States of America

AB In the light of microalgae rich in proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids,
   development of multi-product biorefinery from microalgae has become a
   promising approach towards commercialization of microalgae-based
   products. This review discusses an integrated algal biorefinery (IABR)
   based on a combination of four microalgae-to-products chains for the
   production of biofuels, biopower, and byproducts. Two systematic
   analytical approaches by life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic
   assessment (TEA) are used to quantify the economic and environmental
   benefits. From process systems engineering (PSE) aspects, the approach
   procedures include that (i) the engineering process model serves as the
   foundation for assessment, (ii) an IABR is generated via process design,
   simulation, and integration, and (iii) the multi-objective optimization
   of an IABR with respect to economic and environmental issues is
   addressed.

AB Botryococcus terribilisis a peculiar species that directs a higher
   portion of the consumed CO2to metabolite biosynthesis. It results in a
   low growth rate associated with high oil productivity - compared to
   other species. In addition to its oils (mainly composed of lipids and
   hydrocarbons), this microalgae is also a promising source of proteins,
   carbohydrates, and pigments. The biosynthesis of these products depends
   on the cultivation conditions. Moreover, the extraction method applied
   has a direct influence on the quality of the products and their possible
   applications.Botryococcus terribilismetabolites can be used as
   fertilizers, biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food supply, and
   in a range of biofuels (biodiesel, bioethanol, and biogas). However,
   biorefinery with this microalgae still needs to overcome economic and
   technical hurdles to reach a competitive market value. This work
   analyzed the evolution of the studies with theBotryococcus terribilis,
   approaching it main metabolites and relating it to the cultivation
   conditions, extraction methods, and the final products that can be
   obtained. For the first time, the studies withBotryococcus
   terribiliswere summarized, creating a guide for further research on this
   microalgae by presenting the recommended conditions for its cultivation
   and extraction, its possible applications, the information missing in
   the literature, and the prospects for scale-up.

AB Microalgae biomass has garnered significant attention as a renewable
   energy feedstock and alternative to petroleum-based fuels. The diverse
   metabolism of green microalgae species additionally provides
   opportunities for recovery of products for feed, food, nutraceutical,
   cosmetic, and biopharmaceutical industries. Recently, the concept of
   using microalgae as part of a biorefinery model has been adopted in
   place of refinery methods focused on recovering one target product. This
   has led to producers exploring co-production of high value and high
   volume products in an effort to improve process economics. With numerous
   potential products and applications, the biomass source or specific
   strain must be carefully selected to accumulate extractable levels of
   the target molecule(s). It is additionally imperative to understand the
   morphology and metabolism of the selected strain to cost-effectively
   manage all stages of commercial production. This review will focus
   specifically on microalgae in the division of Chlorophyta, or green
   algae and their extracellular matrices (ECM), potential for commercial
   products, and finally describe a holistic approach for biomolecule
   extraction and recovery. Additionally, cell disruption and fractionation
   methods for recovery of biomolecules for commercial products are
   highlighted along with an alternative method, aqueous enzymatic
   processing for multiple biomolecule extraction and recovery from green
   microalgae. An emphasis is placed on connecting the morphological
   characteristics of microalgae ECM or organelle membranes to implications
   on separation and purification technologies.

   of agricultural crops. We developed standard protocols for the isolation
   and cultivation for a range of marine and brackish microalgae. By
   comparing growth rates and lipid productivity, we assessed the potential
   of subtropical coastal and brackish microalgae for the production of
   biodiesel and other oil-based bioproducts. This study identified
   Nannochloropsis sp., Dunaniella salina and new isolates of Chlorella sp.
   and Tetraselmis sp. as suitable candidates for a multiple-product algae
   crop. We conclude that subtropical coastal microalgae display a variety
   of fatty acid profiles that offer a wide scope for several oil-based
   bioproducts, including biodiesel and omega-3 fatty acids. A biorefinery
   approach for microalgae would make economical production more feasible
   but challenges remain for efficient harvesting and extraction processes
   for some species.

AB Produced water (PW) is the largest effluent generated by the oil
   exploration and production industries worldwide. In recent years,
   microalgae-based biorefineries (MBBs) have emerged as a technological
   solution for biologically treating this effluent while concomitantly
   generating high-value-added products. Nevertheless, while demonstrating
   promising bioremediation results, this developing technology is still in
   the shadow of doubts. Many questions remain regarding the cultivation of
   microalgae in PW. This review critically explores the latest development
   of MBBs that use PW to justify and expand their potential economic,
   sustainable, and social benefits. We comprehensively discuss the
   identification of the main barriers inherent to PW that impair algal
   growth, the effect on the wastewater of carrying out pretreatments
   coupled with biological treatments, the meritorious supplementation with
   agro-industrial effluents, and the promising genera of algae so far
   utilized. To date, Chlorella, Scenedesmus, and Nannochloropsis are the
   most studied microalgal genera. Few studies have focused on the
   synthesis of market bioproducts, where biodiesel is preferred. We
   categorize future challenges and directions into five categories,
   providing insights to enhance MBBs productivity and how oil companies
   can compete sustainably.

   of the residual biomass at 121°C for 15 min produced reducing sugars
   with a yield of 29.5% (w/w) based on the residual biomass dry weight.
   Various enzymes were evaluated for their ability to saccharify the

   enzymatic saccharification products without additional pretreatment
   bySaccharomyces cerevisiaewith yields of 0.14 g ethanol/g residual
   biomass and 0.44 g ethanol/g glucose produced from the residual biomass.
   The waste residual biomass generated during microalgal biodiesel

AB Due to resource depletion and climate change, lipid-based algal biofuel
   has been pointed out as an interesting alternative because of the high
   productivity of algae per hectare and per year and its ability to
   recycle CO2 from flue gas. Another option for taking advantage of the
   energy content of the microalgae is to directly carry out anaerobic
   digestion of raw algae in order to produce methane and recycle nutrients
   (N, P and K). In this study, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of biogas
   production from the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris is performed and the
   results are compared to algal biodiesel and to first generation
   biodiesels. These results suggest that the impacts generated by the
   production of methane from microalgae are strongly correlated with the
   electric consumption. Progresses can be achieved by decreasing the
   mixing costs and circulation between different production steps, or by
   improving the efficiency of the anaerobic process under controlled
   conditions. This new bioenergy generating process strongly competes with
   others biofuel productions.

AB Selection of indigenous and potential algal strain with high lipid
   content is paramount challenge in the avenues of microalgal biodiesel
   production. Particularly, hyper lipid producing algae with maximal
   triacyglycerols (TAGs) content and preferable fatty acid composition is
   of interest for sustainable biodiesel. Hence, the present study on
   comparative assessment of Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus sp. and
   Synechococcus sp. was done in terms of cell density, lipid, TAGs and
   fatty acid. Higher biomass yield was obtained in Chlorella vulgaris
   (0.54 g L-1) on 13th day while maximal lipid content of 36% was observed
   in Scenedesmus sp. followed by Chlorella vulgaris (33%). Lipidomic
   analysis revealed higher non-polar lipids in Chlorella vulgaris (57%)
   and Scenedesmus sp. (54%), whereas in Synechococcus sp. 69% polar lipids
   were present. In fatty acid profile, C24:0 (22.11%) was predominant in
   Chlorella vulgaris, while C20:0 (31.72%) and C18:2 (22.26%) was
   prevalent in Scenedesmus sp. and Synechococcus sp. respectively.

AB Cyanobacteria-derived biofuels can be helpful in achieving a circular

   cyanobacterium, Pseudanabaena mucicola GO0704, mixotrophic cultivation
   using volatile fatty acid (VFA), a cheap organic carbon source, was
   performed. The treatment of butyric acid or acetic acid enhanced the
   cell growth, particularly, the dry weight of the butyric acid-treated
   cells was 2.30-fold higher than the control. The enhancement of the
   growth led to the increase of metabolite (i.e., lipid and carbohydrate)
   productions, resulting in high amount of biodiesel and bioethanol to be
   produced. Butyric acid was more effective compared to acetic acid and
   the productions of biodiesel (52.2 mg/L) and bioethanol (132.6 mg/L)
   from the butyric acid-treated P. mucicola GO0704 were 2.34- and
   2.17-fold higher compared to the control, respectively. This study will
   provide a foundation to commercialize the cyanobacteria-based

AB Microalgal biorefineries represent an opportunity to economically and
   environmentally justify the production of bioproducts. The generation of
   bioproducts within a biorefinery system must quantitatively demonstrate
   its viability in displacing traditional fossil-based refineries. To this
   end, several works have conducted life cycle analyses on microalgal
   biorefineries and have shown technological bottlenecks due to
   energy-intensive processes. This state-of-the-art review covers
   different studies that examined microalgal biorefineries through life
   cycle assessments and has identified strategic technologies for the
   sustainable production of microalgal biofuels through biorefineries.
   Different metrics were introduced to supplement life cycle assessment
   studies for the sustainable production of microalgal biofuel. Challenges
   in the comparison of various life cycle assessment studies were
   identified, and the future design choices for microalgal biorefineries
   were established.

AB Nanoparticle application in microalgae for enhanced lipid production is
   an ongoing work that leads towards the contribution in biodiesel
   production. During this decade, metal nanoparticles are constantly being
   reported to have numerous applications in diverse fields, because of
   their unique optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. They can
   interact with the biomolecules of cells and thereby alters cellular
   metabolisms, which in turn reflects their ability to regulate some
   primary or secondary metabolic pathways. Nanoparticles derived from
   metals like Fe, Cu, and Se are taking part in redox processes and their
   presence in many enzymes may modulate algal metabolisms. Besides by
   upregulating or downregulating the expression of several genes,
   nanoparticle exposure can alter gene expressions in many organisms. In
   microalgae such as Chlorella vulgaris, C. pyrenoidosa, Scenedesmus
   obliquus, S. rubescens, Trachydiscus minutus, Parachlorella kessleri,
   and Tetraselmis suecica; metal nanoparticle exposure in different
   environmental conditions have impacts on various physiological or
   molecular changes, thereby increasing the growth rate, biomass and lipid
   production. The present mini-review gives an insight into the various
   advantages and a future outlook on the application of nanoparticles in
   microalgae for biofuel production. Also, it can be proposed that
   nanoparticles could be useful in blocking or deactivating the AGPase
   enzyme (involved in the glucose to starch conversion pathway), binding
   to its active site, thereby increasing lipid production in microalgae
   that could be utilized for enhanced biodiesel production.

AB In this study, we aimed to explore the commercial potential of various
   microalgae variants found in Al-Asfar Lake, Saudi Arabia, which have not
   been extensively investigated previously. We conducted a comprehensive
   analysis of the metabolic profiles of algae isolated from Al-Asfar Lake.
   The isolated algae were subjected to molecular analysis using specific
   primers for the Chlorophyceae class to confirm their identity.
   Subsequently, we compared the concentration of metabolites in the
   locally isolatedChlorella vulgarisfrom Al-Asfar Lake with five
   commercially available algae (Tetraselmis,Nannochloropsis,Chlorella
   vulgaris,Spirulina, andIsochrysis). To perform the metabolomics
   analysis, we employed untargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography
   (UPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, which yielded a
   total of 168 metabolites from the microalgae samples. The data were
   further analyzed using MetaboAnalyst. The results revealed two distinct
   clusters of microalgae: the first cluster comprisedChlorella vulgarisand
   the microalgae isolated from the lake, while the second cluster
   consisted of two sub-clusters, withIsochrysisgrouped withTetraselmis,
   andNannochloropsisclustered withSpirulina. Notably, the metabolites of
   Al-Asfar Lake algae showed a remarkable similarity toChlorella vulgaris.
   These findings have significant implications for the environmental
   aspect of Al-Asfar Lake, shedding light on critical insights into the
   metabolites and commercial potential of the lake's microalgae. The
   valuable insights gained from this research can be utilized to
   investigate the impact of nutrient abundance on the lake's biodiversity,
   enhance microalgal biomass production for biofuel applications, and
   explore the reuse of lake water in agriculture and environmental
   restoration projects. Overall, our study provides important groundwork
   for understanding the potential of Al-Asfar Lake microalgae and their
   application in various industries, contributing to the sustainable
   development and environmental health of the region.

AB The microalgae-based biorefinement process has attracted much attention
   from academic and industrial researchers attracted to its biofuel, food
   and nutraceutical applications. In this paper, recent developments in
   cell-disruption and lipid-extraction methods, focusing on four
   biotechnologically important microalgal species (namely, Chlamydomonas,
   Haematococcus, Chlorella, and Nannochloropsis spp.), are reviewed. The
   structural diversity and rigidity of microalgal cell walls complicate
   the development of efficient downstream processing methods for
   cell-disruption and subsequent recovery of intracellular lipid and
   pigment components. Various mechanical, chemical and biological
   cell-disruption methods are discussed in detail and compared based on
   microalgal species and status (wet/dried), scale, energy consumption,
   efficiency, solvent extraction, and synergistic combinations. The
   challenges and prospects of the downstream processes for the future
   development of eco-friendly and economical microalgal biorefineries also
   are outlined herein.

   limitation.
SO PLoS ONE
VL 15
IS 7
PY 2020
U1 1
U2 19
AB Microalgae and cyanobacteria are considered as important model organisms
   to investigate the biology of photosynthesis; moreover, they are
   valuable sources of biomolecules for several biotechnological
   applications. Understanding the species-specific traits of
   photosynthetic electron transport is extremely important, because it
   contributes to the regulation of ATP/NADPH ratio, which has
   direct/indirect links to carbon fixation and other metabolic pathways
   and thus overall growth and biomass production. In the present work, a
   cuvette-based setup is developed, in which a combination of measurements
   of dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll fluorescence and NADPH kinetics can
   be performed without disturbing the physiological status of the sample.
   The suitability of the system is demonstrated using a model
   cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, as well as biofuel-candidate
   microalgae species, such as Chlorella sorokiniana, Dunaliella salina and
   Nannochloropsis limnetica undergoing inorganic carbon (Ci) limitation.
   Inorganic carbon limitation, induced by photosynthetic Ci uptake under
   continuous illumination, caused a decrease in the effective quantum
   yield of PSII (Y(II)) and loss of oxygen-evolving capacity in all
   species investigated here; these effects were largely recovered by the
   addition of NaHCO3. Detailed analysis of the dark-light and light-dark
   transitions of NADPH production/uptake and changes in chlorophyll
   fluorescence kinetics revealed species- and condition-specific
   responses. These responses indicate that the impact of decreased
   Calvin-Benson cycle activity on photosynthetic electron transport
   pathways involving several sections of the electron transport chain
   (such as electron transfer via the QA-QB-plastoquinone pool, the redox
   state of the plastoquinone pool) can be analyzed with high sensitivity
   in a comparative manner. Therefore, the integrated system presented here
   can be applied for screening for specific traits in several significant
   species at different stages of inorganic carbon limitation, a condition
   that strongly impacts primary productivity.

TI Cyanobacterial biorefinery: towards economic feasibility through the
   maximum valorization of biomass.
SO Science of the Total Environment
VL 814
PY 2022
U1 1
U2 50
AB Cyanobacteria are well known for their plethora of applications in the
   fields of food industry, pharmaceuticals and bioenergy. Their simple
   growth requirements, remarkable growth rate and the ability to produce a
   wide range of bio-active compounds enable them to act as an efficient
   biorefinery for the production of valuable metabolites. Most of the
   cyanobacteria based biorefineries are targeting single products and thus
   fails to meet the efficient valorization of biomass. On the other hand,
   multiple products recovering cyanobacterial biorefineries can
   efficiently valorize the biomass with minimum to zero waste generation.
   But there are plenty of bottlenecks and challenges allied with
   cyanobacterial biorefineries. Most of them are being associated with the
   production processes and downstream strategies, which are difficult to
   manage economically. There is a need to propose new solutions to
   eliminate these tailbacks so on to elevate the cyanobacterial
   biorefinery to be an economically feasible, minimum waste generating
   multiproduct biorefinery. Cost-effective approaches implemented from
   production to downstream processing without affecting the quality of
   products will be beneficial for attaining economic viability. The
   integrated approaches in cultivation systems as well as downstream
   processing, by simplifying individual processes to unit operation
   systems can obviously increase the economic feasibility to a certain
   extent. Low cost approaches for biomass production, multiparameter
   optimization and successive sequential retrieval of multiple value-added
   products according to their high to low market value from a biorefinery
   is possible. The nanotechnological approaches in cyanobacterial
   biorefineries make it one step closer to the goal. The current review
   gives an overview of strategies used for constructing self-sustainable-
   economically feasible- minimum waste generating; multiple products based
   cyanobacterial biorefineries by the efficient valorization of biomass.
   Also the possibility of uplifting new cyanobacterial strains for
   biorefineries is discussed.

AB The rise in energy consumption would quadruple in the coming century and
   the, existing energy resources might be insufficient to meet the demand
   of the growing population. An alternative and sustainable energy
   resource is therefore needed to address the fossil fuel deficiency. The
   utility of microalgae strains in the aspect of biorefinery has been in

   renewable energy however even after decades of research it still suffers
   from commercialization bottlenecks. The current manuscript reviews the
   scenarios where the innovation needs an ignition for its
   commercialization. This review discusses the prospects of up-scale
   cultivation, and harvesting algal biomass for biorefineries. It narrates
   algal biorefinery hurdles that can be solved using integrated technology
   approach, life cycle assessment and applications of nanotechnology. The
   review also sheds light upon the ties of algal biorefineries with its

AB Commercialization of microalgal biofuels is not yet attained even after
   plentiful of research and extensive scientific projects. Expending the
   cost and energy for producing single microalgal product proven to be
   unviable, and hence integrating multiple product generation from single
   batch of biomass was considered as effective. This review focusses on
   delineating the challenges associated with individual fuel production
   pathways and merits of integrating different fuel production pathways.
   The advantages of integrated microalgal biorefinery have been summarized
   along with energy output and economic impact. Integrated production of
   different biofuels enhances the energy output significantly (biodiesel +
   biocrude oil - 18.8 MJ kg-1, biodiesel + bioethanol - 15.4 MJ kg-1,
   biodiesel + biogas - 13.4 MJ kg-1) and reduced the cost of biomass
   production by about 60% and 40% for biodiesel and other fuel
   productions, respectively. In addition, the integrated production of
   bioproducts with fuels also emphasized in the present study.

TI Turning waste CO2into value-added biorefinery co-products using

AB Currently, there has been an increase in greenhouse gases, primarily
   atmospheric CO2content, from both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic
   sources, leading to global warming and climate change. To achieve the
   goal of climate recovery, biochemically mediated CO2capture and
   utilization have been shown to be particularly promising, with the added
   benefit of repurposing the biomass created by the process. In this
   study, a promising and feasible approach to mitigate waste CO2from the
   atmosphere, flue gas, and biogas was proposed using the
   cyanobacteriumLeptolyngbyasp. KC45 as a highly efficient living
   photocatalyst. Through photoautotrophically cultivatedLeptolyngbya, >
   1875 kg-CO2were photocatalytically transformed into one ton
   ofLeptolyngbyabiomass with its huge amounts of fluorescent pigments
   (9.3-40.2% w/w) and lipids (2.6-11.5% w/w). With the biorefinery
   co-products processing, the antioxidative and anticancer fluorescent
   pigment was firstly extracted, yielding 93-402 kg/ton-biomass. After
   fluorescent pigment extraction,Leptolyngbyalipids from fluorescent
   pigment-free cyanobacterial biomass residues were recovered and then
   transesterified to high-quality green biodiesel, providing 25-112
   kg-biodiesel/ton-biomass. The majority of the recovered lipids (> 93%)
   were made up of C16-C18 fatty acids, and their fuel characteristics were
   acceptable in accordance with the worldwide specifications for
   biodiesel. Therefore, cyanobacteriumLeptolyngbyasp. KC45 has the
   potential to function as a living photocatalyst for the efficient
   conversion of waste CO2of varying concentrations into value-added
   biorefinery co-products. This proved that cyanobacteria-mediated
   CO2capture and biorefinery could greatly contribute to sustainable
   development goals, leading to a sustainable and happy society.

AB Identifying and addressing critical improvements in biomass, bioproduct
   and biofuel productivity is a priority for the nascent algae-based
   bioeconomy. Economic and sustainability principles should guide these
   developing improvements and help to unravel the contentious
   water-food-energy-environment nexus that algae inhabit. Understanding
   the biochemistry of the storage carbon metabolism of algae to produce
   biofuels and bioproducts can bring to light the key barriers that
   currently limit the overall carbon efficiency and the photosynthetic
   efficiency, and ultimately guide productivity and commercial viability
   in the context of limiting resources. In the analysis reported here, we
   present different potential pathways for a conceptual algae biorefinery
   framework, with each pathway addressing one of the main identified
   barriers to future deployment. We highlight the molecular
   identification, in the form of an extensive literature review, of
   potential bioproducts that may be derived directly from both biomass and
   fractions produced through a conversion pathway, for three important
   commercially-relevant genera of
   algae,Scenedesmus,ChlorellaandNannochloropsis. We establish a
   relationship between each of the potential bioproducts, describe
   relevant conversion and extraction processes, and discuss market
   opportunities with values and sizes as they relate to commercial
   development of the products.

AB Social and economic indicators can be used to support design of
   sustainable energy systems. Indicators representing categories of social
   well-being, energy security, external trade, profitability, resource
   conservation, and social acceptability have not yet been measured in
   published sustainability assessments for commercial algal biofuel
   facilities. We review socioeconomic indicators that have been modeled at
   the commercial scale or measured at the pilot or laboratory scale, as
   well as factors that affect them, and discuss additional indicators that
   should be measured during commercialization to form a more complete
   picture of socioeconomic sustainability of algal biofuels. Indicators
   estimated in the scientific literature include the profitability
   indicators, return on investment (ROI) and net present value (NPV), and
   the resource conservation indicator, fossil energy return on investment
   (EROI). These modeled indicators have clear sustainability targets and
   have been used to design sustainable algal biofuel systems. Factors
   affecting ROI, NPV, and EROI include infrastructure, process choices,
   and financial assumptions. The food security indicator, percent change
   in food price volatility, is probably zero where agricultural lands are
   not used for production of algae-based biofuels; however, food-related
   coproducts from algae could enhance food security. The energy security
   indicators energy security premium and fuel price volatility and
   external trade indicators terms of trade and trade volume cannot be
   projected into the future with accuracy prior to commercialization.
   Together with environmental sustainability indicators, the use of a
   suite of socioeconomic sustainability indicators should contribute to
   progress toward sustainability of algal biofuels.

AB As the global demand for sustainable, nutrient-rich protein sources
   intensifies, microalgae have emerged as a promising alternative due to
   their unique biochemical, environmental, and functional properties. This
   narrative review synthesises the nutritional value, protein composition,
   functional behaviour, processing technologies, and food applications of
   microalgae proteins. A literature search was conducted using PubMed,
   Scopus, and Web of Science, with keywords including "microalgae
   proteins", "nutritional value", "functional properties", and
   "alternative protein sources". Priority was given to peer-reviewed
   articles from the past decade that addressed nutritional quality,
   extraction methods, and food applications. Key species, Spirulina,
   Chlorella, Nannochloropsis, and Haematococcus, are highlighted for their
   high protein content (up to 70% dry weight), complete amino acid
   profiles, and rich bioactive compound content. Microalgae proteins show
   excellent solubility, emulsification, gelation, and foaming abilities,
   enabling use in dairy alternatives, baked goods, snacks, and 3D-printed
   foods. Advances in extraction, purification, and protein modification
   have improved their functionality, while cultivation on non-arable land
   and integration into circular biorefineries enhance sustainability.
   Remaining challenges include scalability, sensory optimisation, and
   regulatory clarity. Future studies should focus on improving sensory
   acceptance, optimising cost-effective processing, and expanding consumer
   awareness. Overall, microalgae proteins offer a robust and eco-efficient
   solution to meet global nutrition and sustainability goals.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely used to analyze various
   pathways of biofuel preparation from "cradle to grave." Effects of
   nitrogen supply for algae cultivation and technology of algal oil
   extraction on life cycle fossil energy ratio of biodiesel are assessed
   in this study. Life cycle fossil energy ratio of Chlorella vulgaris
   based biodiesel is improved by growing algae under nitrogen-limited
   conditions, while the life cycle fossil energy ratio of biodiesel
   production from Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown with nitrogen
   deprivation decreases. Compared to extraction of oil from dried algae,
   extraction of lipid from wet algae with subcritical cosolvents achieves
   a 43.83% improvement in fossil energy ratio of algal biodiesel when
   oilcake drying is not considered. The outcome for sensitivity analysis
   indicates that the algal oil conversion rate and energy content of algae
   are found to have the greatest effects on the LCA results of algal
   biodiesel production, followed by utilization ratio of algal residue,
   energy demand for algae drying, capacity of water mixing, and
   productivity of algae.

   the current study evaluated the potential ofDunaliella
   salina,Nannochloropsis oculata,Oocystis minuta, andNeochloris
   conjunctato accumulate biomass, pigments, lipid, carbohydrate, and
   protein under different mechanical agitation conditions of the culture
   systems. The results show that the maximum biomass concentration (2423
   mg/L) and productivity (544 mg/L/d) were observed inD. salinaat a
   stirring speed of 1400 rpm and an aeration rate of 0.15 vvm. Also, the
   maximum total lipid content (23%) was recorded forN. oculataat a shaking
   speed of 200 rpm. The highest protein (49%) and carbohydrate (45%)
   contents were recorded forD salinaandO. minutaat shaking speeds of 125
   and 200 rpm, respectively. The higher proportions of protein and
   carbohydrate over lipid in all of the cultured microalgae species under
   the evaluated mechanical agitation conditions indicate that the
   microalgae species are better candidates for bioethanol production, and
   use as a protein source for animal feed, compared with biodiesel
   production.

AB Excess greenhouse gas emissions and the concomitant effect on global
   warming have become significant environmental, social and economic
   threats. In this context, the development of renewable, carbon-neutral
   and economically feasible biofuels is a driving force for innovation
   worldwide. A lot of effort has been put into developing biodiesel from
   microalgae. However, there are still a number of technological, market
   and policy barriers that are serious obstacles to the economic
   feasibility and competitiveness of such biofuels. Conversely, there are
   also a number of business opportunities if the production of such
   alternative biofuel becomes part of a larger integrated system following
   the Biorefinery strategy. In this case, other biofuels and chemical
   products of high added value are produced, contributing to an overall
   enhancement of the economic viability of the whole integrated system.
   Additionally, dual purpose microalgae-bacteria-based systems for
   treating wastewater and production of biofuels and chemical products
   significantly contribute to a substantial saving in the overall cost of
   microalgae biomass production. These types of systems could help to
   improve the competitiveness of biodiesel production from microalgae,
   according to some recent Life Cycle Analysis studies. Furthermore, they
   do not compete for fresh water resources for agricultural purposes and
   add value to treating the wastewater itself. This work reviews the most
   recent and relevant information about these types of dual purpose
   systems. Several aspects related to the treatment of municipal and
   animal wastewater with simultaneous recovery of microalgae with
   potential for biodiesel production are discussed. The use of pre-treated
   waste or anaerobic effluents from digested waste as nutrient additives
   for weak wastewater is reviewed. Isolation and screening of
   microalgae/cyanobacteria or their consortia from various wastewater
   streams, and studies related to population dynamics in mixed cultures,
   are highlighted as very relevant fields of research. The species
   selection may depend on various factors, such as the biomass and lipid
   productivity of each strain, the characteristics of the wastewater, the
   original habitat of the strain and the climatic conditions in the
   treatment plant, among others. Some alternative technologies aimed at
   harvesting biomass at a low cost, such as cell immobilization, biofilm
   formation, flocculation and bio-flocculation, are also reviewed.
   Finally, a Biorefinery design is presented that integrates the treatment
   of municipal wastewater with the recovery of oleaginous microalgae,
   together with the use of seawater supplemented with anaerobically
   digested piggery waste for cultivatingArthrospira(Spirulina) and
   producing biogas, biodiesel, hydrogen and other high added value
   products. Such strategies offer new opportunities for the cost-effective
   and competitive production of biofuels along with valuable non-fuel
   products.

AB As a result of algae's promise as a renewable energy feedstock, numerous
   studies have used Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify the
   environmental performance of algal biofuels, yet there is no consensus
   of results among them. Our work, motivated by the lack of comprehensive
   uncertainty analysis in previous studies, uses a Monte Carlo approach to
   estimate ranges of expected values of LCA metrics by incorporating
   parameter variability with empirically specified distribution functions.
   Results show that large uncertainties exist at virtually all steps of
   the biofuel production process. Although our findings agree with a
   number of earlier studies on matters such as the need for wet lipid
   extraction, nutrients recovered from waste streams, and high energy
   coproducts, the ranges of reported LCA metrics show that uncertainty
   analysis is crucial for developing technologies, such as algal biofuels.
   In addition, the ranges of energy return on (energy) invested (EROI)
   values resulting from our analysis help explain the high variability in
   EROI values from earlier studies. Reporting results from LCA models as
   ranges, and not single values, will more reliably inform industry and
   policy makers on expected energetic and environmental performance of
   biofuels produced from microalgae.

AB Increased population, shortage of fossil fuels and climatic changes
   constitute global challenges demanding actions and strategic planning
   for securing access of food, feed, biochemicals and other
   biotechnological potentials in future. Therefore, alternative sources
   demand innovative thinking and microalgal biomass offers a great
   potential for meeting future challenges. These do not need agricultural
   soil for growth and their cultivation requires 99% less fresh water than
   conventional agriculture. They exhibit high biomass yields per unit area
   and there is no CO2emissions compared to fossil fuels. Microalgae can be
   used to enhance the nutritional value of food and animal feed owing to
   their chemical composition. They play a crucial role in aquaculture and
   fish feeding and can be incorporated in cosmetics. Although these offer
   the potential to produce high yields of proteins, however, only few
   likeSpirulinahave been exploited commercially. Potential for the
   pigments namely chlorophyll, carotenoids and phycobilins and enzymes
   like lactamase, protease and lipase are being assessed by the
   researchers. Additionally, utilization of algal biomass for vitamins,
   toxins, enzymes and biochemicals of therapeutic significance is being
   studied. Many are used in nutritional supplements and cosmetics
   utilizingDunaliella,Spirulina,Chlorella,Haematococcusetc. The production
   of &beta; carotene fromDunaliellain open raceway ponds was possible by
   the organism's ability to withstand high salinity. The fresh water
   algaHaematococcusproduces astaxanthin which has found use in fish
   aquaculture (red colour of Salmon fish) as well as innovative
   anti-inflammatory and antioxidant applications in human nutrition. The
   lipids ofNannochloropsisare used in cosmoceutical and skin care
   applications and efforts are underway to move into nutrition
   applications. The more specific components of some algae known as
   omega-3 fatty acids are very important in products directed at
   maintaining heart health. Research in such directions can bring about
   potential economic benefits in the form of commercial opportunities,
   start up of new companies and jobs as well as environmental benefits,
   reduced used of agricultural land, carbon dioxide reduction and increase
   of oxygen release to the atmosphere.

AB Overuse of petroleum and ongoing carbon-di-oxide (CO2) rise in the air
   of Brunei Darussalam has been emerged as a major environmental concern
   in this country. To resolve this issue, a comprehensive life cycle
   assessment (LCA) of alternative biofuel, bioethanol production from
   microalgae was demanded for realistic implementation. Therefore, LCA of
   bioethanol production from microalgae in terms of CO2 emission and
   energy balance was investigated based on the scenario of
   industrial-scale in Brunei Darussalam. This study demonstrated that 220
   tons microalgae biomass was cultivated on 6 ha offshore lands for
   commercial bioethanol generation. The annual outcome of this commercial
   bioethanol plant has revealed net CO2 balance 218.86 ton. From the
   energy perspective, this study manifested itself as favourable with net
   energy ratio, 0.45 and net energy balance, -2749.6 GJ y-1. Apart from
   CO2 balance and energy generation aspect, the project demanded low water
   and land footprints. For photobioreactor cultivation, water and land
   footprints were 2 m3 GJ-1 and 2 m2 GJ-1, respectively as well as for
   open pond approach, they were 87 m3 GJ-1 and 13 m2 GJ-1, respectively.
   The project also presented microalgae growth supplements (phosphorus and
   nitrogen) accumulation possibilities from wastewater of manure and
   industries which is another positive aspect for benign environment.
   Overall, the commercial plant presented low CO2 emission, low land and
   water demand for microalgae cultivation, alternative eco-friendly and
   cheaper nutrients sources, quite high energy generation with main
   product and by-products. Thus, this study projected positive impact on
   energy and environmental aspects of microalgae-to-bioethanol conversion.

AB Depleting fossil fuels and net carbon emissions associated with their
   burning have driven the need to find alternative energy sources.
   Biofuels are near-perfect candidates for alternative energy sources as
   they are renewable and account for no net CO2emissions. However, biofuel
   production must overcome various challenges to compete with conventional
   fuels. Conventional methods for bioconversion of biomass to biofuel
   include chemical, thermochemical, and biological processes. Substrate
   selection and processing, low yield, and total cost of production are
   some of the main issues associated with biofuel generation. Recently,
   the uses of nanotechnology and nanoparticles have been explored to
   improve the biofuel production processes because of their high
   adsorption, high reactivity, and catalytic properties. The role of these
   nanoscale particles and nanocatalysts in biomass conversion and their
   effect on biofuel production processes and yield are discussed in the
   present article. The applicability of nanotechnology in production
   processes of biobutanol, bioethanol, biodiesel, biohydrogen, and biogas
   under biorefinery approach are presented. Different types of
   nanoparticles, and their function in the bioprocess, such as electron
   transfer, pretreatment, hydrolysis, microalgae cultivation, lipid
   extraction, dark and photo fermentation, immobilization, and suppression
   of inhibitory compounds, are also highlighted. Finally, the current and
   potential applications of nanotechnology in biorefineries are also
   discussed.

AB Algae are considered promising renewable feedstocks for the production
   of alternative fuels. In this study, an indigenous strain of Scenedesmus
   bijugatus found commonly in the fresh water bodies was isolated and
   evaluated for biofuels production. The alga was successfully mass
   cultivated in the custom made vertical tubular photobioreactor (250 L
   capacity) at semi-continuous mode. During the cultivation period, the
   volumetric biomass and lipid productivity were assessed. The alga S.
   bijugatus produced 0.26 g L-1 d-1 of dry biomass and 63 mg L-1 d-1 of
   lipids, respectively. Algal biomass was harvested by a combined
   harvesting process involving coagulation and flocculation using Iron
   (III) sulfate and an organic polymer which resulted in 98% harvesting
   efficiency. Lipid extraction using hexane:diethyl ether (1:2 ratio)
   resulted in maximum extraction of lipids. This study also examined
   sequential stages of esterification and transesterification to convert
   lipids to biodiesel. The maximum biodiesel yield of 0.21 g/g of dry
   biomass was obtained through the acid base catalytic process. The
   biodiesel fuel properties were tested and observed that most of the
   properties complying with ASTM D6751 specifications. The lipid extracted
   residual biomass recorded a yield of 0.158 g of bioethanol per g. This
   study confirmed the potential of lipid extracted biomass for the
   production of bioethanol to improve the economic feasibility of
   microalgal biorefinery.

AB Over the years, microalgae have been identified to be a potential source
   of commercially important products such as pigments, polysaccharides,
   polyunsaturated fatty acids and in particular, biofuels. Current demands
   for sustainable fuel sources and bioproducts has led to an extensive
   search for promising strains of microalgae for large scale cultivation.
   Prospective strains identified for these purposes were among others,
   mainly from the
   generaHematococcus,Dunaliella,Botryococcus,Chlorella,ScenedesmusandNanno
   chloropsis. Recently, microalgae from the Selenastraceae emerged as
   potential candidates for biodiesel production. Strains from the
   Selenastraceae such asMonoraphidiumsp. FXY-10,M. contortumSAG
   47.80,Ankistrodesmussp. SP2-15 andM. minutumwere high biomass and lipid
   producers when cultivated under optimal conditions. A number of
   Selenastraceae strains were also reported to be suitable for cultivation
   in wastewater. This review highlights recent reports on potential
   strains from the Selenastraceae for biodiesel production and contrasts
   their biomass productivity, lipid productivity as well as fatty acid
   profile. Cultivation strategies employed to enhance their biomass and
   lipid productivity as well as to reduce feedstock cost are also
   discussed in this paper.

AB Microalgae are getting more interests from industry and science
   communities. Applications of these small, unicellular microorganisms are
   countless: from fourth generation biofuels, through fish feed to
   pharmaceuticals. Ordinary methods of cultivation may be associated with
   many problems such as high costs, high energy consumption, and low
   product yield. It is difficult to control contaminations in open ponds
   while photobioreactors are mainly at laboratory scale and expensive to
   scale-up. Scientists are investigating various methods of microalgae
   cultivation and processing to overcome those problems. One of the novel
   approaches is the non-suspended method for microalgae culturing, where
   microalgae are grown on attached surfaces. Growing microalgae on
   surfaces is an attractive option and showing promising results. In
   comparison with ordinary suspended photobioreactors, the attached
   systems offer higher biomass yields, easy to scale-up with better light
   distribution within the reactor and better control of contamination.
   Moreover, the consumption of water can be drastically reduced. So far,
   there is not enough research for this method. Limited studies have been
   reported on enclosure mode of this approach with algae encapsulation
   into matrix. It is found that this mode would be difficult to scale up
   due to high costs of the enclosure material and difficulty of separating
   microalgae from matrix. Non-enclosure mode is more promising way of
   non-suspended cultivation. So far, no work has been carried out to
   conduct non-suspended culturing with the use of aeroterrestrial
   microalgae. They are species growing on the surfaces at highly humid
   environments. Using them in attached cultivation systems could
   potentially lower the water consumption to minimum. Studies have shown
   that the biomass of lower water content can be produced if compared to
   non-suspended cultivation methods. In addition, mechanization of the
   cultivation and harvesting processes would be less complex, as the
   product will not be immersed in the liquid. There would be no need for
   glass reactors, as lights can be placed in the spaces between surfaces.
   The light distribution is predicted to be the highest among all existing
   methods, as there would be no free floating particles absorbing and
   reflecting light. It will only need humid conditions, rich in CO2between
   attachment surfaces. To evaluate potential advantages for non-suspended
   culturing of aeroterrestrial microalgae in non-enclosure way, proper
   experiments need to be conducted. In this review, basic concepts of
   attached cultivation system are discussed, focusing on the studies of
   biofilm formation including factors affecting deposition and systems.
   The detailed description of aeroterrestrial microalgae is included to
   give insight into potential applications of the species into attached
   cultivation systems.

AB Global environmental policies to reduce the emissions of greenhouse
   gases and to increase the use of renewable energy have created premises
   for identification and exploitation of new, economic and non-polluting
   resources. Algae biomass has gained interest in the production of
   bioethanol because it is renewable, carbonneutral, sustainable and can
   be cultivated in non-productive, non-arable land (without competing with
   production of food crops) or in fresh and grey water. Algae can grow in
   wastewater (in open ponds and photobioreactors), contributing to
   wastewater treatment, reducing nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous),
   chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids,
   heavy metals and coliforms. Algal biomass has fast growth-rate (12 days)
   and the doubling time during exponential growth is only 3.5 hours.
   Macroalgae contains carbohydrates (starch, cellulose and hemicellulose)
   and undergoes pretreatments (acidic, alkaline, or enzymatic hydrolysis)
   to obtain reducing sugars, which are fermented with yeast to obtain
   bioethanol. Many strains of algae grown in wastewater,
   includingChlorella,Chlamydomonas,Dunaliella,Porphyridium,SpirogyraandSpi
   rulinacontain up to 50% of their dry weight carbohydrates (starch and
   glycogen) and are converted into bioethanol. Global production and
   consumption of bioethanol are expected to increase to 134.5 billion
   liters by 2024. This paper presents the importance of cultivating algae
   in wastewater, and reviews the most recent achievements in the
   production of third generation bioethanol from algae strains using acid,
   alkali and enzymatic pretreatments, respectively the importance
   ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaefor the fermentation of sugars extracted from
   algae.

AB Microalgae present some advantageous qualities for reducing carbon
   dioxide (CO2) emissions from ethanol biorefineries. As photosynthetic
   organisms, microalgae utilize sunlight and CO2 to generate biomass. By
   integrating large-scale microalgal cultivation with ethanol
   biorefineries, CO2 sequestration can be coupled with the growth of
   algae, which can then be used as feedstock for biodiesel production. In
   this case study, a 50-mgy ethanol biorefinery in Iowa was evaluated as a
   candidate for this process. Theoretical projections for the amount of
   land needed to grow algae in raceway ponds and the oil yields of this
   operation were based on the amount of CO2 from the ethanol plant. A
   practical algal productivity of 20 g m-2 d-1 would require over 2,000
   acres of ponds for complete CO2 abatement, but with an aggressive
   productivity of 40-60 g m-2 d-1, a significant portion of the CO2 could
   be consumed using less than 1,000 acres. Due to the cold temperatures in
   Iowa, a greenhouse covering and a method to recover waste heat from the
   biorefinery were devised. While an algal strain, such as Chlorella
   vulgaris, would be able to withstand some temperature fluctuations, it
   was concluded that this process is limited by the amount of available
   heat, which could maintain only 41 acres at 73°F. Additional heating
   requirements result in a cost of 10-40 USD per gallon of algal oil,
   which is prohibitively expensive for biodiesel production, but could be
   profitable with the incorporation of high-value algal coproducts.

AB Microalgae-based carbon dioxide (CO2) biofixation and biorefinery are
   the most efficient methods of biological CO2reduction and reutilization.
   The diversification and high-value byproducts of microalgal biomass,
   known as microalgae-based biorefinery, are considered the most promising
   platforms for the sustainable development of energy and the environment,
   in addition to the improvement and integration of microalgal
   cultivation, scale-up, harvest, and extraction technologies. In this
   review, the factors influencing CO2biofixation by microalgae, including
   microalgal strains, flue gas, wastewater, light, pH, temperature, and
   microalgae cultivation systems are summarized. Moreover, the biorefinery
   of Chlorella biomass for producing biofuels and its byproducts, such as
   fine chemicals, feed additives, and high-value products, are also
   discussed. The technical and economic assessments (TEAs) and life cycle
   assessments (LCAs) are introduced to evaluate the sustainability of
   microalgae CO2fixation technology. This review provides detailed
   insights on the adjusted factors of microalgal cultivation to establish
   sustainable biological CO2fixation technology, and the diversified
   applications of microalgal biomass in biorefinery. The economic and
   environmental sustainability, and the limitations and needs of
   microalgal CO2fixation, are discussed. Finally, future research
   directions are provided for CO2reduction by microalgae.

AB The article considers the opportunities for reduction of energy
   consumption in the life cycle of biodiesel obtained from microalgae oil.
   Results show that by introducing technical glycerol and substrate
   leftover after production of biogas into the microalgae growth media
   energy consumption can be significantly reduced. Production of biogas
   from de-oiled microalgae improves the energy balance of the life cycle
   of biodiesel obtained from microalgae oil. It is impossible to obtain
   fuel containing more energy than would be used in the process of
   production if microalgae for biodiesel production are cultivated in
   conventional growth media. Only by subjecting microalgal biomass for
   production of gaseous and liquid biofuel (biodiesel and biogas) the
   total energy consumption is lower and equals to 65802.03 MJt-1than
   energy value of biofuel, i.e. 79083.32 MJt-1. In this case the fossil
   energy ratio (FER) for biodiesel reaches 1.2.

VL 10

U1 12
U2 31
AB Lutein, a yellow xanthophyll carotenoid, is increasingly recognized for
   its nutraceutical benefits, particularly in protecting the retina's
   macula from age-related degeneration. Microalgae are a promising source
   of lutein, which can be a primary product or a coproduct in
   biorefineries. Certain microalgae exhibit lutein levels (up to 1.7%)
   surpassing those of common dietary sources like kale, spinach, and egg
   yolk (approximately 0.7-0.9%). Predominantly associated with photosystem
   II's light-harvesting complex, lutein is crucial in photosynthesis and
   cellular defense. However, being quantitatively minor among cellular
   constituents, lutein necessitates specialized processing for efficient
   extraction. Although ubiquitous in microalgae, it is not as easily
   inducible as beta-carotene and astaxanthin in Dunaliella salina and
   Haematococcus pluvialis, respectively. Currently, microalgal lutein
   production predominantly occurs at the bench scale, presenting
   challenges in scaling up. Factors like culture medium significantly
   influence biomass and lutein yields in industrial production, while
   downstream processing requires cost-effective, food-grade solvent
   extraction techniques. This review delves into contemporary methods and
   innovative progress in microalgal lutein production, emphasizing
   industrial-scale processes from biomass cultivation to final product
   formulation. A conceptual industrial process proposed in this review
   shows that two 10 m3 photobioreactors could produce 108 kg dry mass for
   Chlorella minutissima, which can be processed into approximately 616 g
   of lutein extract, or over 6000 capsules of finished nutraceutical
   daily. Despite lutein production via microalgae being in nascent stages
   at large scales, existing research provides a solid foundation for
   well-informed scale-up endeavors.

AB Biofuel-bioenergy production has generated intensive interest due to
   increased concern regarding limited petroleum-based fuel supplies and
   their contribution to atmospheric CO2 levels. Biofuel research is not
   just a matter of finding the right type of biomass and converting it to
   fuel, but it must also be economically sustainable on large-scale.
   Several aspects of cyanobacteria and microalgae such as oxygenic
   photosynthesis, high per-acre productivity, non-food based feedstock,
   growth on non-productive and non-arable land, utilization of wide
   variety of water sources (fresh, brackish, seawater and wastewater) and
   production of valuable co-products along with biofuels have combined to
   capture the interest of researchers and entrepreneurs. Currently,
   worldwide biofuels mainly in focus include biohydrogen, bioethanol,
   biodiesel and biogas. This review focuses on cultivation and harvesting
   of cyanobacteria and microalgae, possible biofuels and co-products,
   challenges for cyanobacterial and microalgal biofuels and the approaches
   of genetic engineering and modifications to increase biofuel production.

AB Our systematic review sets out the state-of-the-art of algae-specific
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs are semiconductor devices, and
   potentially the next generation of artificial illumination for
   energizing photoautotrophic algal systems. These addressable
   electroluminescence-injecting tiny bulbs render exceptional spectral and
   physicochemical properties for microalgae to grow and develop healthiest
   possible. Hence, they can enhance metabolic bioengineering of strains
   potentially capable of production of renewable bioenergy and integration
   into photobiological platforms. Thereby, the major sections of our
   meta-analytical overview go deepest possible into the development and
   implementation of specie-specific wavelengths to optimize (i) production
   of future-proof biofuels (e.g., biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas) and
   commercially valuable biomolecules (e.g., pigments, carbohydrates,
   proteins and fatty acids) to health-promoting dietary supplements and
   cosmeceuticals; (ii) biodepuration of environmental contaminants (e.g.,
   heavy metals, minerals and drug-resistant antibiotics) of emerging
   concern worldwide and biofixation of CO2; (iii) power consumption; and
   (iv) economics of narrowband colorful LEDs, relative to wideband white
   LED and fluorescence-producing technologies, primarily compact lamps.
   Our paper is timely and provides valuable knowledge on tunable
   narrowbands with particularities to photoinduction and photomodulation
   of physiological and phytochromatic mechanisms in commercially relevant
   taxonomic groups. This will open up the horizons for making cutting-edge
   science in LEDs towards an essentially provocative yet emerging concept
   of fine-scale artificial photoautotrophic algal cultivation with more
   profitability and environmental-social responsibility.

AB The biorefinery approach proposes a model for the profitable
   exploitation of most or all of the industrial facility in an integrated
   manner. This strategy is ideal for converting biomass into a variety of
   food, chemical, pharmaceutical, and energy products. This last, in turn,
   represents the main step towards the production of alternative fuels,
   such as biodiesel, which still has a high production cost and,
   therefore, prevents market concurrence against the resilient fossil
   fuels. In this sense, the objective of this review is to critically
   address the issues related to biodiesel facilities to make them
   commercially competitive. The consolidated biorefineries (soybean, palm,
   rapeseed, and sunflower) and the emergent biorefineries (jatropha,
   microalgae, yeast, and activated sludge) were presented and discussed
   with the focus in the multiproduct refining. Based on the data analysis
   and interpretation compiled in this review, biorefineries are not
   economically viable against the robustness of the main competitor, the
   oil refineries. In terms of availability of feedstocks, consolidated
   biorefineries depend on public policy action, while the emerging ones
   depend on research and development. Environmental aspects of the
   biodiesel technologies, although they think ahead about the use of
   bioresources, they are slightly promising, but not enough in the
   majority to be a defining criterion.

AB The goal of this work was to give a comprehensive review on biogas
   production from microalgae biomass. Different process parameters were
   summarized in tables which could become comprehensive compendium of
   operation conditions of microalgae preparation for biogas production.
   Further,, the limitations of the process implementation and
   commercialization (e.g. high costs of implementation and maintenance,
   low biomass productivity, limited methane yield due to specific
   structure of microalgae cell wall) were discussed. It was concluded that
   the microalgae anaerobic digestion should be incorporated with
   production of other bioproducts such as biodiesel, bioethanol or
   volatile fatty acids. Such a biorefinery would open possibility to
   improve both wastewater treatment and generate valuable products from
   waste streams.

AB Many LCA based viability studies have already been done for the
   production of green diesel from microalgae, still a comprehensive LCA,
   has not yet been undertaken. Current study aims to find out if the Net
   Energy Balance (NEB) can further be increased by using a combination of
   many available agronomical practices & the techniques of production of
   green diesel from microalgae. The results show that neither open raceway
   pond nor Photobioreactor routes (Wet and dry routes) yield positive
   energy balance. The production of green diesel via open raceway pond,
   both in dry as well as wet route, have less negative NEB and
   comparatively higher NER than the photobioreactors. Comparison says that
   open raceway pond dry route has slightly higher value for NER than the
   wet route. Even with the best possible route (open raceway pond dry
   route), the total energy use is almost 5 times more than the energy
   produced, with a negative NEB of 4.07 MJ & very low NER value of 0.20.
   Study concludes that R & D in the area of green diesel production from
   microalgae has yet to go a long way & has a huge scope to further lower
   its input energy demand for biofuel production.

AB Commercialization of microalgal cultivation has been well realized in
   recent decades with the use of effective strains that can yield the
   target products, but it is still challenged by the high costs arising
   from mass production, harvesting, and further processing. Recently, more
   interest has been directed towards the utilization of waste resources,
   such as sludge digestate, to enhance the economic feasibility and
   sustainability of microalgae production. Anaerobic digestion for waste
   disposal and phototrophic microalgal cultivation are well-characterized
   technologies in both fields. However, integration of anaerobic digestion
   and microalgal cultivation to achieve substantial economic and
   environmental benefits is extremely limited, and thus deserves more
   attention and research effort. In particular, combining these two makes
   possible an ideal 'waste biorefinery' model, as the C/N/P content in the
   anaerobic digestate can be used to produce microalgal biomass that
   serves as feedstock for biofuels, while biogas upgrading can
   simultaneously be performed by phototrophic CO2fixation during
   microalgal growth. This review is thus aimed at elucidating recent
   advances as well as challenges and future directions with regard to
   waste biorefineries associated with the integration of anaerobic waste
   treatment and microalgal cultivation for bioenergy production.

U1 12
U2 41
AB The rapid dwindling of fossil fuels coupled with the ever-increasing
   energy needs has led to increased focus on the usage of other renewable
   sources of energy. Microalgae is one of the sustainable options, as a
   feedstock, for the production of biodiesel. A variety of growth media
   have been studied and used for microalgal isolation, growth and
   production of commercially valuable products including lipids,
   carbohydrates and pigments. Blue green 11 (BG-11) medium has been widely
   reported as a mainstream medium for microalgal biomass and lipid
   production, especially for freshwater microalgae. The need for enhanced
   microalgal biomass production led to a planned alteration and
   optimization of the BG-11 composition such as nitrogen, phosphorus,
   carbon or wastewater supplementation, depending on the mode of
   cultivation. A number of studies have corroborated the effects of both
   modified and unmodified versions of BG-11 composition, on different
   microalgal species, in terms of both biomass and lipid production. This
   review attempts to discuss the effect of varying the BG-11 composition
   on biomass and lipid productivity from a few freshwater microalgae that
   are largely employed to produce biodiesel. The paper specifically
   chooses BG-11 as the workhorse microalgal medium in the laboratory scale
   unlike other literature which describe the use of most of the media. The
   microalgal genera considered for the review
   includeChlorella,Scenedesmus,BotryococcusandChlorococcum. These form the
   largest part of freshwater microalgae in the literature and a study of
   these would present a bird's eye view of growth characteristics of most
   of the freshwater microalgae. Certain other marine microalgae and
   cyanobacteria have also been included wherein BG-11 medium and/or its
   variations have led to a considerable increase in biodiesel production.

AB In response to energy crisis, global warming and climate changes,
   microalgae have received a great deal of interest as a biofuel
   feedstock. However, the development of microalgal biofuels witnesses an
   obvious and serious dilemma. The reported literature shows that "fuel
   only" option is not economically viable due to the overwhelming
   investments in capital and operation. Hence, it is questionable whether
   it is too luxurious to produce microalgae only for biofuel application.
   In addition, there are some voiced concerns related to the impacts of
   microalgal biofuel production on the conventional applications, such as
   cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and nutritious feed. It is therefore
   questionable whether the microalgal biofuel production will affect the
   original functions. From a sustainability point of view, the author
   explores the current challenges in microalgal applications and proposes
   an innovative framework for microalgal biorefinery, which can realize
   the production of multiple products in the form of high values and
   biofuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas. With the aim at
   maximizing the value derived from different microalgal components, the
   innovative microalgal biorefinery concept includes four pathways:
   high-value products-biodiesel-bioethanol-biogas; high-value
   products-bioethanol-biogas; high-value products-biodiesel-biogas; and
   high-value products-biogas. Special attention has been paid to the
   production of high-value products through system integration and
   engineering, which is expected to promote the economics of microalgal
   biofuels. Net energy ratio assessment and cost-effectiveness assessment
   have been highlighted to testify the feasibility of microalgal
   biorefinery options, and some crucial actions have been suggested to
   help establish the process.

AB Biofuels are viewed as the answer to safeguard the currently challenged
   energy security. To this end, the present study provides a comparison
   between approaches regarding microalgal biomass conversion to bioenergy,
   with a view on sustainable implementation. The energetic valorization of
   Chlorella vulgaris biomass cultivated under heterotrophic,
   sulfur-limited conditions was investigated through the biofuels
   biodiesel, biogas (biomethane) and combustible dry biomass. The lipid
   productivity can reach the value of 442.96.5 mg L-1 d-1 containing
   suitable fatty acids for biodiesel production. Next, biochemical methane
   potential (BMP) assays yielded 360.920.2 mL CH4 g VS-1added under
   mesophilic conditions, while the calorific value of dry C. vulgaris
   biomass was measured as 24,538182 kJ kgDW-1 (5,86543 kcal kgDW-1).
   Considering the downstream processing required in each approach, the
   most promising energy valorization method is anaerobic digestion able to
   reach values up to 20,862 kJ Lreactor-1 day-1 in continuous systems.

AB Algae is a very promising source for renewable energy production since
   it can fix the greenhouse gas (CO2) by photosynthesis and does not
   compete with the production of food. Compared to microalgae, research on
   biofuel production from macroalgae in both academia and industry are at
   infancy for economically efficient and technological solutions. This
   review provides up to-date knowledge and information on macroalgae-based
   biofuels, such as biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel and bio-oils
   respectively obtained from anaerobic digestion, fermentation,
   transesterification, liquefaction and pyrolysis technique methods. It is
   concluded that bioethanol and bio-oils from wet macroalgae are more
   competitive while biodiesel production seems less attractive compared to
   high lipid content microalgae biomass. Finally, a biorefinery concept
   based on macroalgae is given.

AB Over the past 15 years, China has become the major producer of
   microalgal biomass in the world.Spirulina(Arthrospira) is the largest
   microalgal product by tonnage and value, followed
   byChlorella,Dunaliella, andHaematococcus, the four main microalgae grown
   commercially. China's production is estimated at about two-thirds of
   global microalgae biomass of which roughly 90% is sold for human
   consumption as human nutritional products ('nutraceuticals'), with
   smaller markets in animal feeds mainly for marine aquaculture. Research
   is also ongoing in China, as in the rest of the world, for other
   high-value as well as commodity microalgal products, from
   pharmaceuticals to biofuels and CO2capture and utilization. This paper
   briefly reviews the main challenges and potential solutions for
   expanding commercial microalgae production in China and the markets for
   microalgae products. The Chinese Microalgae Industry Alliance (CMIA), a
   network founded by Chinese microalgae researchers and commercial
   enterprises, supports this industry by promoting improved safety and
   quality standards, and advancement of technologies that can innovate and
   increase the markets for microalgal products. Microalgae are a growing
   source of human nutritional products and could become a future source of
   sustainable commodities, from foods and feeds, to, possibly, fuels and
   fertilizers.

AB Increasing resource demand, predicted fossil resources shortage in the
   near future, and environmental concerns due to the production of
   greenhouse gas carbon dioxide have motivated the search for alternative
   'circular' pathways. Among many options, microalgae have been recently
   'revised' as one of the most promising due to their high growth rate
   (with low land use and without competing with food crops), high
   tolerance to nutrients and salts stresses and their variability in
   biochemical composition, in so allowing the supply of a plethora of
   possible bio-based products such as animal feeds, chemicals and
   biofuels. The recent raising popularity of Circular Bio-Economy (CBE)
   further prompted investment in microalgae, especially in combination
   with wastewater treatment, under the twofold aim of allowing the
   production of a wide range of bio-based products while bioremediating
   wastewater. With the aim of discussing the potential bio-products that
   may be gained from microalgae grown on urban wastewater, this paper
   presents an overview on microalgae production with particular emphasis
   on the main microalgae species suitable for growth on wastewater and the
   obtainable bio-based products from them. By selecting and reviewing 76
   articles published in Scopus between 1992 and 2020, a number of
   interesting aspects, including the selection of algal species suitable
   for growing on urban wastewater, wastewater pretreatment and
   algal-bacterial cooperation, were carefully reviewed and discussed in
   this work. In this review, particular emphasis is placed on
   understanding of the main mechanisms driving formation of microalgal
   products (such as biofuels, biogas, etc.) and how they are affected by
   different environmental factors in selected species. Lastly, the
   quantitative information gathered from the articles were used to
   estimate the potential benefits gained from microalgae grown on urban
   wastewater in Campania Region, a region sometimes criticized for poor
   wastewater management .

AB Microalgae including Cyanobacteria are the largest primary producers in
   any aquatic ecosystem. Their metabolic functions have developed during
   the evolutionary process for adapting to diversified & extreme
   environments. With the development of marine biotechnology, microalgae
   from unique & extreme marine environments are attracting attention as a
   novel biological sources for superfine chemicals to be employed in
   varied applications of pharmaceuticals, neutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals,
   etc. where biopigments like Phycobiliproteins, Carotenoids; biopolymers
   like Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), Exo-polysaccaharide (EPS) have an
   indispensable role to play. Due to the present day health awareness
   amongst the human beings, the gradual increase in demand of the
   natural/herbal products have rightly evaluated the treasure of our
   planet Earth i.e. Microalgae. Since, a decade we have been exploring and
   exploiting the potential of Microalgae for C-PC, C-PE, R-PE,
   Beta-carotene, PHAs, EPS, Lipids, Biosequestration of metals and
   Bioremediation, though there are still many unexploited and unexplored
   potentials hidden within the vast reign of Microalgae. Why only few
   microalgal species made their way into successful Biotechnology? Only
   three main Genus Arthrospira (Spirulina), Dunaliella and Chlorella have
   been grown at large scale by several companies for neutraceuticals.
   Spirulina and Dunaliella thrive in extreme conditions of alkalinity and
   salinity respectively, while, Chlorella is endowed with a relatively
   high growth rate, which makes them obey the "Law of survival of the
   Fittest" avoiding the possible contaminants while growing in open pond
   culture. There are many challenges to be faced by the Microalgae to be a
   commercially promising candidate in future, amongst which 4 main points
   are: (a) proper strain selection and further genetic improvement, (b)
   rate of biomass production, (c) efficient harvesting and (d) prevention
   of the product from denaturation. As per our gradually growing needs and
   the concern for the better LIFE with SAFE ENVIRONMENT, the known
   potentials of microalgae should be scaled up and the latent potentials
   should be explored and exploited in a balanced and tactful manner.

AB Background: To overcome the daunting technical and economic barriers of
   algal biofuels, we evaluated whether seawater can be a viable medium for
   economically producing filamentousSpirulina subsalsaas feedstock, using
   monosodium glutamate residue (MSGR) produced by the glutamate extraction
   process as an inexpensive nutrient source. Results:Spirulina
   subsalsacannot grow in pure seawater, but exhibited faster biomass
   accumulation in seawater supplemented with MSGR than in freshwater
   medium (modified Zarrouk medium). Introducing seawater into media
   ensured this cyanobacterium obtained high lipid productivity (120
   mg/L/day) and suffered limited bacterial infections during growth.
   Moreover, the yields of protein, carotenoids and phytols were also
   improved in seawater mixed with MSGR.S. subsalsaexhibited high biomass
   and lipid productivity in bag bioreactors with 5- and 10-L medium,
   demonstrating the potential of this cultivation method for scaling up.
   Moreover, seawater can produce more biomass through medium reuse. Reused
   seawater medium yielded 72% of lipid content compared to pristine
   medium. The reason thatS. subsalsagrew well in seawater with MSGR is its
   proficient adaptation to salinity, which included elongation and
   desaturation of fatty acids, accumulation of lysine and methionine, and
   secretion of sodium. The nutrients provided by MSGR, like organic
   materials, played an important role in these responses.
   Conclusion:Spirulina subsalsahas an efficient system to adapt to saline
   ambiance in seawater. When supplemented with MSGR, seawater is a great
   potential medium to produceS. subsalsain large scale as biofuel
   feedstock. Meanwhile, value-added products can be derived from the ample
   protein and pigments that can broaden the range of biomass application
   and improve this biorefinery economics.

AB This life cycle assessment (LCA) study analyzed the environmental
   consequences of integrating microalgae-based wastewater treatment into a
   shrimp farm with recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Microalgae
   treatment produced < 10% of the system's freshwater eutrophication
   potential (FEP), marine eutrophication potential (MEP) and global
   warming potential, which was dominantly contributed by electricity use.
   Microalgae treatment performed comparably to activated sludge treatment
   for FEP reduction, and was more effective in remediating marine
   eutrophication. Replacing coal in electricity mix, particularly with
   renewables, reduced the system's impacts by up to 90-99%. Performing the
   LCA based on system expansion generally obtained higher impacts compared
   to allocation. Utilizing algal biomass for biogas production reduced the
   MEP; however, production of feed ingredient and biodiesel were not
   environmentally beneficial. This study proved the use of microalgae for
   aquaculture wastewater treatment to be environmentally feasible, the
   results can guide more sustainable RAS operations and design of
   full-scale microalgae treatment.

   of the number of publications, the number of citations, the impact
   factor, affiliated research units and individual countries. Based on the
   number of keyword occurrences and a content analysis of 367
   publications, seven leading areas of scientific interest (clusters) were
   identified: (1) techno-economic profitability of biofuels, bioenergy and
   pigment production in microalgae biorefineries, (2) the impact of the
   construction of photobioreactors and process parameters on the
   efficiency of microalgae cultivation, (3) strategies for increasing the
   amount of obtained lipids and obtaining biodiesel inChlorellamicroalgae
   cultivation, (4) the production of astaxanthin on an industrial scale
   usingHaematococcusmicroalgae, (5) the productivity of biomass and the
   use of alternative carbon sources in microalgae culture, (6) the effect
   of light and carbon dioxide conversion on biomass yield and (7)
   heterotrophy. Analysis revealed that topics closely related to bioenergy
   production and biofuels played a dominant role in scientific research.
   This publication indicates the directions and topics for future
   scientific research that should be carried out to successfully implement
   economically viable technology based on microalgae on an industrial
   scale.

U1 7
U2 43
AB The aim of this study was to assess the social impacts of
   microalgae-based systems for wastewater treatment and bioproducts
   recovery by using the Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) tool. In
   particular, two systems were analysed: (1) a system treating urban
   wastewater, and (2) another system treating wastewater from the food
   industry. Moreover, these alternatives were compared to (3) a system for
   bioproducts production from microalgae grown in a standard growth
   medium. The recovered bioproducts in all the systems considered were:
   natural pigments, biogas and digestate, which can be reused as
   biofertilizer. Results showed that the scenario using standard growth
   medium was the one showing the best results in all impacts and
   stakeholder categories (up to 24-fold lower impacts depending on the
   impact category). This was mainly due to: (i) the simplicity of the
   system, which consequently improves health and safety for workers; (ii)
   the absence of contaminants which consequently improves health and
   safety, acceptability and olfactory impact for both consumers and the
   local community; (iii) the presence of well-established legislation,
   regulatory frameworks, and full-scale deployment, which benefit value
   chain actors and society. Overall, this study also identified several
   social factors hindering a transition towards a circular bioeconomy in
   the microalgae-based systems for the wastewater treatment and resource
   recovery sector.

AB Biodiesel production from non-edible feedstock such as microalgae is
   gaining importance in present day, as they do not interfere with global
   food economy in addition to higher photosynthetic efficiency as compared
   to plants. Fresh water grown Neochloris oleoabundans UTEX 1185 is
   considered as a potential source for biodiesel production. The present
   study investigated different direct lipid extraction process from wet
   microalgal biomass through autoclaving, microwave, and ultrasonication
   pretreatments. Autoclave treatment showed a higher efficiency for lipid
   extraction as compared to other two pretreatments. Furthermore,
   transesterification process was carried out in presence of Fe2O3
   catalyst and compared with conventional acid (HCl) and base (NaOH)
   catalysts. Fe2O3 nanoparticles used were synthesized from extract of
   Hibiscus rosa-sinensis by green procedure. The synthesized Fe2O3
   catalyst played an important role in improving the biodiesel yield up to
   81%, which is higher than that obtained with HCl (64%) and NaOH (48%).
   Thereafter transesterification process parameter like catalyst content,
   reaction temperature and reaction time were optimized and finally 86%
   biodiesel yield was obtained. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) profile
   analysis and fuel properties revealed the suitability of algal lipid for
   biodiesel production. 20.2% w/w of carbohydrate present in lipid
   extracted microalgal biomass was further converted into biohydrogen by
   dark fermentation and bioethanol under anaerobic condition using
   acidogenic mixed consortia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (INVSC-1),
   respectively. The life cycle assessment study of the overall process was
   also done.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is regarded as a promising technology
   for the production of biofuels from biomass and wastes. As such, there
   is a drive towards continuous-flow processing systems to aid process
   scale-up and eventually commercialization. The current study presents
   results from a novel pilot-scale HTL reactor with a feed capacity of up
   to 100 L/h and a process volume of approximately 20 L. The pilot plant
   employs a heat exchanger for heat recovery and a novel hydraulic
   oscillation system to increase the turbulence in the tubular reactor.
   The energy grass Miscanthus and the microalgae Spirulina, both
   representing advanced dedicated energy crops, as well as sewage sludge
   as high-potential waste stream were selected to assess the reactor
   performance. Biomass slurries with up to 16 wt% dry matter content were
   successfully processed. The heat recovery of the heat exchanger is found
   to increase with reactor run time, reaching 80% within 5-6 h of
   operation. The hydraulic oscillation system is shown to improve mixing
   and enhance heat transfer. Bio-crudes with average yields of 26 wt%, 33
   wt% and 25 wt% were produced from Miscanthus, Spirulina and sewage
   sludge, respectively. The yields also appeared to increase with reactor
   run time. Bio-crude from HTL of Spirulina was mainly composed of
   palmitic acid, glycerol, heptadecane and linolelaidic acid, while
   biocrude from sewage sludge contained mainly palmitic acid, oleic acid
   and stearic acid. In contrast, biocrude from HTL of Miscanthus consisted
   of a large number of different phenolics. An energetic comparison
   between the three feedstocks revealed a thermal efficiency of 47%, 47%
   and 33% and energy return on investment (EROI) of 2.8, 3.3 and 0.5 for
   HTL of Miscanthus, Spirulina and sewage sludge, respectively.

AB Microalgae have been proposed as carbon-neutral and sustainable fuel
   feedstock producers due to their fast growth and high lipid content. In
   this investigation, we examined the effect of different nutrient
   stresses on overall lipid productivities and physiology, in two
   microalgae species, namely Nannochloropsis salina and Dunaliella salina.
   For both the species in semi-continuous cultures, the dilution ratio was
   found to affect only the harvest period and not the biomass or lipid
   productivity. Harvest at different growth phases was influenced by the
   temporal nutrient status of the medium leading to different productivity
   of biomass and lipids. These two species also showed different cellular
   biochemistry and lipid metabolism in response to the different nutrient
   stresses. More efficient stimulators of lipid production than the
   commonly employed nitrogen limitation were identified, for e.g.
   deficiency of trace element. Significant influence of nutrient
   deficiency on lipid profiles was observed in N. salina, such as chain
   length and degree of unsaturation, with desirable characteristics for
   biodiesel production. The comparison of lipid profiles between these two
   species revealed phenomenal differences in some fatty acids, e.g. a
   higher level of gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6) in D. salina and the
   exclusive presence of palmitoleic acid in N. salina. The biochemical
   composition with respect to the cellular function of the fatty acids is
   discussed with an attempt to better understand the differences in the
   lipid profiles.

AB Rising global prices, increasing energy demand, and increasing
   greenhouse gas have led to the use of biodiesel fuel. Biodiesel fuel is
   a suitable alternative to diesel in diesel engines. Therefore, it is
   critical to analyze the economic aspects to decrease the cost of
   biodiesel production by finding more efficient catalysts as well as more
   suitable feedstocks. Therefore, this review paper focuses on recent
   findings of biodiesel generation from various oil sources using
   nanocatalysts. To this end, properties of various feedstocks and their
   oil content, characterization of various nanocatalysts and their ability
   in biodiesel production, life cycle assessment, and economic aspects of
   biodiesel production have been thoroughly studied. Also, several
   critical factors were studied on the economic feasibility of biodiesel
   generation, including various oil sources, type of nanocatalyst, the
   production capacity of the factory, the selling price of glycerol
   (by-product), the cost of land, labor cost, equipment, and alcohol type.
   Moreover, the cost of energy for biodiesel generation from various oil
   sources was investigated. The findings reveal that the use of CaO and
   MgO nanocatalysts and their derivatives decreases the cost of biodiesel
   production due to their simple synthesis, low-cost, abundance in nature,
   and high catalytic ability. Also, labor costs and plant production
   capacity have been indicated to have remarkable impacts on the biodiesel
   price. Moreover, the use of low-cost and non-edible oils with high oil
   content such asSchizochytriumsp. microalga and jojoba can significantly
   reduce the cost of biodiesel production.

AB Fossil fuel depletion and carbon dioxide emissions are calling for
   carbon neutral energies such as algal biofuels, yet actual production of
   agal biofuels is limited by costly and energy-intensive manufacturing.
   This issue could be partly solved by adding nanomaterials to algal
   cultures in order to increase algal growth and lipid content, and to
   enhance lipid extraction. Here we review nanotechnologies to improve
   biofuel production from microalgae. We discuss microalgae as a source of
   fuel, food supplements, and CO2for biorefineries that produce
   biomethane, biohydrogen, and bioethanol. Then we compare nanocatalysts
   for biodiesel production with enzymatic catalysts. The major
   nanomaterials used are metallic, magnetic, metal oxide or
   acid-functionalised nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes.

AB With the further expansion of the fossil crisis and the increasing
   demand for biodiesel, it is imperative to develop highly reusable
   catalysts. Therefore, in this study, the completed synthesis of
   MgO/ZSM-5 catalysts via impregnation and ultrasonic dispersion methods
   were achieved to be applied in the clean production from Spirulina
   platensis-derived biodiesel. Physiochemical analyses including
   thermogravimetry (TG), temperature programmed desorption of CO2
   (CO2-TPD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with
   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area
   (BET) were used to define the basicity, structure, composition and
   morphology of synthesized catalysts. The optimum process conditions
   obtained by Taguchi method were as follows, the molar ratio of ethanol
   to oil was 15/1, the catalyst concentration was 3 wt%, and the yield of
   biodiesel reached 92.1% after 1 h reaction at 75°C. The optimal catalyst
   had strong stability and catalytic activity in the repeated cycle test,
   even after five cycles, the yield of biodiesel was still above 85%. The
   transesterification of Spirulina oil catalyzed by MgO/ZSM-5 catalyst
   accorded with the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the activation energy
   was 49.67 kJ/mol. Finally, the economic feasibility analysis of
   biodiesel illustrated that the new supported catalyst can effectively
   reduce the cost of production and provide favorable support for the
   future continuously industrial production.

AB Algae have come into prominence over the last decade as a commercial
   biofuel feedstock due to their high production efficiencies compared to
   first and second feedstocks. However, algal investment is not
   economically feasible currently due to the operational and capital cost.
   There is still need for innovations for both high productivity and green
   productions. In order to decrease the cost of the algal processes, usage
   of some wastes as cultivation medium for algal productions and novel
   biofuel production methods should be considered according to green
   chemistry principals. In this study, seawater and wastewater supplied
   from Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration (ISKI) were used and
   combined at different ratios to be utilized as a growth medium for
   Nannochloropsis oculata and Tetraselmis suecica microalgae strain under
   the same growth conditions, and its effect on cell proliferation and
   growth kinetics were investigated. It was found that, both N. oculata
   and T. suecica can tolerate and utilize the wastewater and, the specific
   growth rate of the cultures can up to 0.5430 d-1 (75% of wastewater) for
   N. oculata and 0.4778 d-1 (25% of wastewater) for T. suecica. Different
   concentrations show different results for the growth of two species due
   to the effect of higher concentrations of the fundamental sources on
   growth stage and change of ionic composition of the culture medium. To
   evaluate bioethanol production performance of these two strains, samples
   which included maximum carbohydrate content as well as control groups
   were chosen for further studies. The results showed that T. suecica is
   much suitable for ethanol production using municipal wastewater as a
   culture medium.

AB Many studies have demonstrated that heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth
   for various microalgae species yields greater biomass and lipid content
   as compared to photoautotrophic cultivation. This review explores the
   possibility of leveraging the natural ability of the microorganisms to
   metabolize carbon heterotrophically and mixotrophically in agricultural
   wastewaters. This has the potential advantage of improving the overall
   economics for the production of biodiesel and value-added biomolecules
   from microalgae, mitigating an existing waste stream and minimizing
   water requirements. However, there are a number of challenges and gaps
   in scientific knowledge that suggest a need for ongoing research in the
   area. In this review, specific focus is dedicated to the metabolic
   mechanisms, reported performances, and practical challenges that
   contribute to the uncertainty of employing agricultural wastewaters for
   heterotrophic and mixotrophic microalgae cultures.

AB Effects of nitrogen source inhomogeneity on nutrient removal and
   biodiesel production of mono- and mix-cultured microalgae were
   investigated in this study. The microalgal growth characteristics, lipid
   accumulation, biodiesel production and nutrient removal were determined
   by mono- or co-culturing microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus
   dimorphus in media with different nitrogen sources. The results showed
   that microalgae cultivated in media with different nitrogen sources
   indicated higher nitrogen removal, biomass increase and productivities
   of biomass, lipids and biodiesel than media with the sole nitrogen
   source. As for the microalgae grown in media with the same nitrogen
   source, the pattern for the lipid content was in the relationship C.
   vulgaris > mixed culture > S. dimorphus. The fatty acids of microalgae
   mainly consisted of C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:2 and C18:3, accounting for
   79.6-90.6% of the total. The biodiesel production in this study ranged
   from 8.5 to 11.2 g-biodiesel/100 g-dry weight. This study presents one
   of the few studies, suggesting that nitrogen source itself can influence
   the nutrient removal and biodiesel production of mono- and mix-cultured
   microalgae.

AB The circular bioeconomy concept relies on the exploitation of wastes as
   a feedstock of different biotechnological processes to obtain, as much
   as possible, a huge spectrum of biochemical components through a
   biorefinery platform. This work deals with the treatment of brewery
   effluent through the cultivation ofScenedesmus obliquusmicroalga and the
   use of the biomass in a complex biorefinery. The treatment proved
   efficient in the removal of nutrients (N, P and COD removals of 88, 30
   and 71% respectively). Several compounds and products were obtained from
   the biomass, such as: (a) phenols (0.249-1.016 mg GAE mL-1) and
   flavonoids (0.05-0.167 mg CE mL-1) by subcritical water extraction (SWE)
   at 120°C, the extraction efficiency being five times higher at 200°C;
   (b) biohydrogen by dark fermentation (67.1 mL H2gVS-1); (c) bio-oil
   (64%), biochar (30%) and biogas (6%) by pyrolysis; and (d) enhanced
   capacity of germination/growth of wheat and barley seeds byS.
   obliquusculture and biomass (pellet, after centrifugation); better
   results were obtained with the biomass cultivated in brewery effluent
   (when compared with synthetic medium), and the biomass pellet was better
   than the whole culture; barley seeds treated with the pellet from the
   brewery effluent had the highest germination index (GI) of 85 compared
   with the control (tap water) GI of 35. The innovative study emphasis was
   on reducing microalgae production costs, providing environmental
   benefits in a biorefinery-basedS. obliquusplatform.

AB Emissions from transportation and industry primarily cause global
   warming, leading to floods, glacier melt, and rising seas. Widespread
   greenhouse gas emissions and resulting global warming pose significant
   risks to the environment, economy, and society. The need for alternative
   fuels drives the development of third-generation feedstocks: microalgae,
   seaweed, and cyanobacteria. These microalgae offer traits like rapid
   growth, high lipid content, non-competition with human food, and growth
   on non-arable land using brackish or waste water, making them promising
   for biofuel. These unique phototrophic organisms use sunlight, water,
   and carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce biofuels, biochemicals, and more.
   This review delves into the realm of microalgal biofuels, exploring
   contemporary methodologies employed for lipid extraction, significant
   value-added products, and the challenges inherent in their
   commercial-scale production. While the cost of microalgae bioproducts
   remains high, utilizing wastewater nutrients for cultivation could
   substantially cut production costs. Furthermore, this review summarizes
   the significance of biocircular economy approaches, which encompass the
   utilization of microalgal biomass as a feed supplement and
   biofertilizer, and biosorption of heavy metals and dyes. Besides, the
   discussion extends to the in-depth analysis and future prospects on the
   commercial potential of biofuel within the context of sustainable
   development. An economically efficient microalgae biorefinery should
   prioritize affordable nutrient inputs, efficient harvesting techniques,
   and the generation of valuable by-products.

AB This study presents a thermoeconomic and environmental assessment of the
   extraction of lipids and proteins from wet microalgal biomass in a 3 G
   biorefinery by two different technologies: supercritical fluid
   extraction (SFE) and low-pressure solvent extraction (LPSE). Simulation
   tools were used to study a sugarcane biorefinery producing ethanol from
   sugarcane juice (1 G) and bagasse (2 G); the microalgal growth in an
   open pond; and the processing of microalgal biomass into lipids,
   proteins and synthetic natural gas (SNG). Supercritical water
   gasification (SCWG) of microalgal biomass enables an increase in biofuel
   production of 10.2% MJ when no extraction process is considered and of
   1.9% MJ when LPSE is considered. The heat demand of the proposed
   biorefinery with LPSE was increased by 87.8% compared with the demand of
   the sugarcane biorefinery without microalgal growth and processing. When
   the SFE process is considered, the heat demand of the overall process
   increased 3.2 times. SFE for wet microalgae processing is not
   economically attractive, as it increases the total investment by 71%.
   The CO2flow used in the SFE process demonstrated to be a key factor in
   the thermoeconomic viability of the process. Regarding the wet
   processing of microalgae prior to SCWG, the best alternative studied was
   the use of LPSE technology.

AB Cyanobacterial biomass has constituted a crucial third and
   fourth-generation biofuel material, with great potential to synthesize a
   wide range of metabolites, mainly carbohydrates. Lately,
   carbohydrate-based biofuels from cyanobacteria, such as bioethanol,
   biohydrogen, and biobutanol, have attracted attention as a sustainable
   alternative to petroleum-based products. Cyanobacteria can perform a
   simple process of saccharification, and extracted carbohydrates can be
   converted into biofuels with two alternatives; the first one consists of
   a fermentative process based on bacteria or yeasts, while the second
   alternative consists of an internal metabolic process of their own in
   intracellular carbohydrate content, either by the natural or genetic
   engineered process. This study reviewed carbohydrate-enriched
   cyanobacterial biomass as feedstock for biofuels. Detailed insights on
   technical strategies and limitations of cultivation, polysaccharide
   accumulation strategies for further fermentation process were provided.
   Advances and challenges in bioethanol, biohydrogen, and biobutanol
   production by cyanobacteria synthesis and an independent fermentative
   process are presented. Critical outlook on life-cycle assessment and
   techno-economical aspects for large-scale application of these
   technologies were discussed.

AB Numerous life cycle analysis (LCA) studies of microalgae to fuel have
   been released over the past 3 years in an attempt to determine the
   environmental sustainability of this novel concept. Despite numerous
   issues with these LCA studies, they have highlighted that cultivation
   and dewatering/drying for extraction and conversion are major energy
   sinks within the process. This paper provides a critical review of
   extraction and conversion methods discussed in literature and under
   commercial investigation. The basis of this review is energy
   consumption, with its purpose to highlight methods that deserve further
   attention in research and development. This review concludes with an
   energetic assessment of four conversion processes including pulsed
   electric field-assisted extraction followed by transesterification, in
   situ acid catalysed esterification of dry biomass, in situ hydrolysis
   and esterification of wet biomass and hydrothermal liquefaction. The
   analysis highlighted that energetically feasible methods do exist for
   the conversion of microalgal biomass to fuel; however, all require
   further research to be applied at commercial scale.

AB Microalgal lipids consist of non-polar and polar lipids.
   Triacyleglyceride (TAG), a non-polar lipid, is convertible to biodiesel,
   whereas glycolipids and phospholipids are polar and not convertible to
   biodiesel owing to their high degree of unsaturation (polyunsaturated
   fatty acids), which makes the production process insufficient and
   expensive. In this review, microalgal species that contain the highest
   lipid content (≥40%) in the literature till 2019 are highlighted. The
   differentiation between non-polar and polar lipids and the limitations
   in the conversion of polar lipids to biodiesel are reported. The basic
   and advanced factors contributing to the accumulation of lipids
   convertible to biodiesel is discussed. Microalgal species including
   Scenedesmus obliquus, Ourococcus multisporus, Chlamydomonas
   pitschmannii, Micractinium reisseri, and Botryococcus braunii with high
   lipid content are potential candidates for biomass/biodiesel production
   and nutrient removal from wastewater. Application of lipidomics and
   transcriptomics to manipulate the lipid associated gene acetyl-CoA
   synthetase in microalgae improves the accumulative lipid content.

U2 166
AB Microalgae is considered an alternative source for biodiesel production
   producing renewable, sustainable and carbon-neutral energy. Microalgae
   property changes among species, which determines the efficiency of
   biodiesel production. Besides the lipid content evaluation,
   multi-principles (including high lipid productivity, high biomass yield,
   pollution resistance and desired fatty acid, etc.) for superior
   oil-producing species screening was proposed in this review and three
   microalgae species (Chlorella vulgaris,Scenedesmus
   obliquusandMychonastes afer) with high bio-lipid producing prospect were
   screened out based on big data digging and analysis. The multilateral
   strategies for algal-lipid stimulating were also compared, among which,
   nutrient restriction, temperature control, heterotrophy and chemicals
   addition showed high potential in enhancing lipid accumulation; while
   electromagnetic field showed little effect. Interestingly, it was found
   that the lipid accumulation was more sensitive to nitrogen
   (N)-limitation other than phosphorus (P). Nutrient restriction, salinity
   stress etc. enhanced lipid accumulation by creating a stressed
   environment. Hence, optimum conditions (e.g. N:15-35 mg/L and P:4-16
   mg/L) should be set to balance the lipid accumulation and biomass
   growth, and further guarantee the algal-lipid productivity. Otherwise,
   two-step cultivation could be applied during all the stressed
   stimulation. Different from lab study, effectiveness, operability and
   economy should be all considered for stimulation strategy selection.
   Nutrient restriction, temperature control and heterotrophy were highly
   feasible after the multidimensional evaluation.

AB Sludge generated from wastewater treatment plants causes severe
   environmental problems, which can be significantly reduced using
   anaerobic digestion. However, CO2, anaerobic digestate, and the residues
   from anaerobic digestion process still need to be treated. Accordingly,
   some energy-rich microalgae can grow well in sludge digestate contained
   wastewater, which enhances its economic feasibility for biofuel
   production. Therefore, in this review, the integration of sludge
   digestion and microalgal cultivation is proposed for enhancing the
   performance of bioenergy and biorefinery industries. Microalgae can
   simultaneously utilize sludge digestate and CO2as the carbon sources for
   biofuel production and biogas upgradation. This comprehensive review
   mainly analyzes different compositions of anaerobic digestate, sludge
   pretreatment methods, favorable environmental factors, and different
   CO2concentrations, which influence the growth of microalgae and the
   accumulation of bioenergy. Finally, the waste residues from sludge
   digestion and microalgae cultivation are converted to bio-gas, bio-oil,
   and biochar, which can be used as biofuels, supercapacitors, adsorbents,
   and catalysts through thermal conversion. This review indicates that the
   pyrolysis process has a positive net energy production and hydrothermal
   treatment can be chosen as the wet biomass conversion method. The aim of
   this review is to provide useful information for combining the sludge
   digestion and microalgal cultivation to simultaneously reduce the
   pollutants and produce bioenergy.

AB Microalgae and cyanobacteria are easy to culture, with higher growth
   rates and photosynthetic efficiencies compared to terrestrial plants,
   and thus generating higher productivity. The concept of microalgal
   biorefinery is to assimilate carbon dioxide and convert it to chemical
   energy/value-added products, such as vitamins, carotenoids, fatty acids,
   proteins and nucleic acids, to be applied in bioenergy, health foods,
   aquaculture feed, pharmaceutical and medical fields. Therefore,
   microalgae are annotated as the third generation feedstock in bioenergy
   and biorefinery. In past decades, many studies thrived to improve the
   carbon sequestration efficiency as well as enhance value-added compounds
   from different algae, especially via genetic engineering, synthetic
   biology, metabolic design and regulation. From the
   traditionalAgrobacterium-mediated transformation DNA to novel CRISPR
   (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology
   applied in microalgae and cyanobacteria, this review has highlighted the
   genome editing technology for biorefinery that is a highly environmental
   friendly trend to sustainable and renewable development.

AB The increasing global demand for energy and advances in new biofuel
   production routes have increased the research on the potential of
   microalgae and cyanobacteria as a third generation of biofuels. The
   majority of research has been focused on using this type of biomass for
   producing biodiesel and biogas; however, more recent developments have
   indicated the potential of microalgae and cyanobacteria for the
   production of bioethanol. There are three routes for producing
   bioethanol from such microorganisms: the traditional one involving
   hydrolysis and fermentation of biomass with bacteria or yeast, the dark
   fermentation route, and the use of engineered cyanobacteria or
   "photofermentation." In recent years, the use of engineered
   cyanobacteria to directly produce ethanol has gained enormous attention,
   mainly after the successful use of these microorganisms in industrial
   plants. However, only little information is available on the efficiency
   and the real advantages and disadvantages of these processes, and
   particularly, a comparison between traditional processes and engineered
   cyanobacteria. This study compiles the main publications on the
   production of bioethanol from microalgae and cyanobacteria, and
   summarizes the main features, advantages, and key aspects for each type
   of process. The industrial implementation of these technologies depends
   on the capability of reducing production costs through more scientific
   research and technical development, to become competitive with the lower
   cost of fossil fuels also thanks to public subsidies.

AB Production of biogas from microalgae has been receiving significant
   attention since 1950s, as microalgae are capable of rapidly growing in
   the non-arable land area and accumulating high quantity of digestible
   macromolecules in the biomass. Nevertheless, commercial production of
   microalgae-based biogas is still in its immature stage for some existing
   technoeconomic challenges, as exemplified by the requirement of a costly
   and energy consuming step in biomass harvesting, recalcitrance of the
   components, low biomass loading rate, and interferences of various
   operational factors. Real-world research and developments are therefore
   necessary for achieving a state-of-the-art technology to produce
   microalgal biogas. In this context, extensive research efforts have been
   devoted since decades as attempts to improve efficiency and
   sustainability of this bioprocess. This paper presents a critical and
   comprehensive review on the key issues and perspectives of microalgal
   biogas in terms of current knowledge and future developments. Over the
   contemporary reviews published on this topical area, present paper
   distinctly covers almost all the relevant aspects, which might draw a
   complete picture on microalgal biogas and provide necessary perspectives
   for conducting further research efforts. Specifically, this paper
   discusses potentials of microalgae as the biogas feedstocks, screening
   and selection approaches of potent strains, technological aspects of
   microalgal biogas production, reactor design for anaerobic digestion
   (AD), operational conditions affecting AD, strategies for improving
   strains and biogas yield, biogas upgrading, kinetics, modelling and
   economics, life cycle assessment (LCA), and challenges coupled with
   further research opportunities.

U1 4
U2 12
AB This study aimed to investigate the recovery of agricultural
   biostimulants and biogas from microalgae treating wastewater, in the
   framework of a circular bioeconomy. To this end, municipal wastewater
   was treated in demonstrative raceway ponds, and microalgal biomass
   (Scenedesmus sp.) was then harvested and downstream processed to recover
   biostimulants and biogas in a biorefinery approach. The effect of
   microalgal biostimulants on plants was evaluated by means of bioassays,
   while the biogas produced was quantified in biochemical methane
   potential (BMP) tests. Furthermore, the fate of contaminants of emerging
   concern (CECs) over the process was also assessed. Bioassays confirmed
   the biostimulant effect of microalgae, which showed gibberellin-, auxin-
   and cytokinin-like activity in watercress seed germination, mung bean
   rooting, and wheat leaf chlorophyll retention. In addition, the
   downstream process applied to raw biomass acted as a pre-treatment to
   enhance anaerobic digestion performance. After biostimulant extraction,
   the residual biomass represented 91% of the methane yield from the raw
   biomass (276 mLCH4.g-1VS). The kinetic profile of the residual biomass
   was 43% higher than that of the unprocessed biomass. Co-digestion with
   primary sludge further increased biogas production by 24%. Finally, the
   concentration of CECs in wastewater was reduced by more than 80%, and
   only 6 out of 22 CECs analyzed were present in the biostimulant
   obtained. Most importantly, the concentration of those contaminants was
   lower than in biosolids that are commonly used in agriculture, ensuring
   environmental safety.

AB Microalgae biomass has the potential to provide different types of
   renewable transportation fuel such as biodiesel, bioethanol,
   bio-hydrogen, and biogas. Among them, microalgae based biodiesel is
   getting more attention now days. However, large-scale production has
   many challenges to satisfy the expected future demand for biodiesel
   produced from microalgae. This investigation aims to examine the
   feasibility of biodiesel from Chlorella vulgaris microalga grown at
   large scale under outdoor conditions. Chlorella vulgaris was grown in 60
   liter Flat plate photobioreactor at batch and semi-continuous mode The
   results demonstrated that Chlorella vulgaris showed maximum biomass
   productivity (164.3 mg/L/d) with lipid content of 14.17% when two third
   culture was harvested, but lipid productivity was found maximum (23.92
   g/L) when one half culture was harvested during semi-continuous mode.
   Fatty acid profile of Chlorella vulgaris grown in flat plate
   photobioreactor has shown abundance of fatty acids with carbonchain
   length of C16 and C18. Moreover, the fuel properties of biodiesel such
   as viscosity, density, Cetane number, saponification value, iodine
   value, and cold filter plugging point were found accordance with Indian
   standards IS 15607: 2005, Standard ASTMD6751, and European Standard (EN
   14214).

AB Microalgae have been used commercially since the 1950s and 1960s,
   particularly in the Far East for human health foods and in the United
   States for wastewater treatment. Initial attempts to produce bulk
   chemicals such as biofuels from microalgae were not successful, despite
   commercially favorable conditions during the 1970s oil crisis. However,
   research initiatives at this time, many using extremophilic microalgae
   and cyanobacteria (e.g., Dunaliella and Spirulina), did solve many
   problems and clearly identified biomass productivity and harvesting as
   the two main constraints stopping microalgae producing bulk chemicals,
   such as biofuels, on a large scale. In response to the growing unease
   around global warming, induced by anthropogenic CO2 emissions,
   microalgae were again suggested as a carbon neutral process to produce
   biofuels. This recent phase of microalgae biofuels research can be
   thought to have started around 2007, when a very highly cited review by
   Chisti was published. Since 2007, a large body of scientific
   publications have appeared on all aspects of microalgae biotechnology,
   but with a clear emphasis on neutral lipid (triacylglycerol) synthesis
   and the use of neutral lipids as precursors for biodiesel production. In
   this review, the key research on microalgal biotechnology that took
   place prior to 2007 will be summarized and then the research trends post
   2007 will be examined emphasizing the research into producing biodiesel
   from microalgae.

AB Currently, the most important barrier in algal cultivation is growth
   nutrients cost. In the present study, the isolated
   algaSynechocystisPCC6803 was acclimatized under laboratory conditions
   using municipal wastewater and taken for large-scale cultivation in an
   open raceway pond. At the semi-continuous mode, the alga produced the
   highest biomass yield of 0.21 g L-1d-1and it was estimated that the
   algae could be able to produce 94.5 tones dry biomass ha-1year-1. A
   low-cost study was conducted to harvest the maximum biomass recovery.
   The result shows that a combined use of iron (III) chloride and
   biopolymer enhanced the harvesting process and the maximum biomass
   recovery was achieved up to 98.7%. In addition, the biomass production
   cost was thoroughly explored, and it was estimated that the
   microalgaeSynechocystisbiomass production cost was approximately 2-3 US$
   per kg of biomass. Meanwhile, to reduce the lipid extraction cost, a
   direct transesterification was performed using tungstated zirconia as a
   heterogeneous catalyst and the highest biodiesel yield of 90.5% was
   obtained. In addition, the biodiesel fuel properties were analyzed, and
   the results revealed that most of the fuel properties found within ASTM
   D6751 limits. Furthermore, the lipid extracted residues was explored for
   bioethanol extraction, and 0.186 g bioethanol/g residue was obtained.
   This is the first study to demonstrate the algaSynechocystiscultivation
   in an open raceway pond using municipal wastewater successfully and
   produced two potential biofuels.

   Burning environmental issues, intensifying costs and limited
   availability of fossil fuels have generated the need of alternative
   energy sources. Nowadays several plants, microbes are being studied for
   their potential role in production of biofuel such as bio hydrogen,
   bioethanol and biodiesel. Cyanobacteria provide a quite promising
   platform due to their simpler organization and easy genome modification
   capability. This review put forward an insight on the vital issues of
   alternative energy where cyanobacteria prove to be one of the best
   choices as a source of renewable energy.

AB Marine microalgae constitute a natural source of compounds (e.g.,
   alkanes, triacylglycerols) useful for biodiesel production - nyet
   improvement of lipid productivity by microalgae is a sine qua non for
   the economic feasibility of such a microalga-based process. Toward this
   goal, five Tetraselmis strains, Tetraselmis suecica UW605, T. suecia
   AROSA, and three Tetraselmis sp. strains, coded as lipogenic (63LG and
   75LG) or non-lipogenic (46NLG) on the basis of stationary-phase cell
   flotation features, were cultured semi-continuously and subjected to 10
   and 30% renewal rates; the effects upon growth rate and lipidic profile
   were accordingly assessed. As expected, cell productivity by all strains
   was higher under a renewal rate of 30%. Chlorophyll, protein, and total
   lipid content per cell also increased with the highest renewal rate.
   Conversely, cell content of neutral lipids, measured with Nile red
   staining, decreased with increasing renewal rate. The non-lipogenic
   strain 46NLG revealed a much lower total lipid content, at the 10%
   renewal rate, than all other strains, but a higher neutral lipid
   content. This result supports the use of the flotation method for the
   selection of lipogenic strains. The diverse profiles of the various
   Tetraselmis strains and the effect of renewal rate on their neutral
   lipid content emphasize the importance of strain screening to promote a
   suitable microalgae selection for biodiesel production purposes.

AB Numerous studies on the techno-economic and life cycle assessment of
   microalgal biodiesel production are available in the literature, and an
   overwhelming majority of such studies suggest that the standalone
   production of biodiesel is currently unviable. The production of
   microalgal biomass using the currently available technologies costs
   approximately $4.92 kg-1, which is unacceptably high for biodiesel
   production. The challenges lie in high biomass production cost and
   unfavorable energetic balance and significant process, and engineering
   advancements are desirable before mass-scale production of algal oil and
   biodiesel at a cost-competitive price is realized. On the other hand,
   various high-value products sourced from microalgae are already
   commercialized. The biomass production cost of $4.92 kg-1 is more than
   acceptable if such products are also derived which, according to some
   estimates, may command a price as high as $123 kg-1 biomass. It is
   expected that with process modifications and engineering advancements,
   the biomass production cost can be brought down to as low as $0.50 kg-1.
   Moreover, coupling phycoremediation of pollution loads in waste streams
   to microalgal biomass production offers economic (up to $170 t-1 biomass
   produced) and environmental gains (90% reduction in water footprint,
   improved GHG balance, and a substantial reduction in external input of
   fertilizers). Such approaches are more likely to translate into an
   economically appealing and environmentally desirable business model. The
   current study is an attempt to analyze some of the recent research
   investigations addressing the concept of a microalgal biorefinery for
   the production of biodiesel.

AB The cultivation of Plectonema terebrans BERC10 in wastewater and

   for multiple products in a biorefinery could help in achieving
   environmental sustainability and cost effectiveness. This study
   evaluated the resource recovery potential of the cyanobacterium
   Plectonema terebrans BERC10 from urban wastewater followed by the
   cascading processing of the biomass into multiple bioproducts. The
   annual biomass productivity ranged from 0.035-0.064 gL-1d-1 and
   contained 40-46% lipids and 20-38% protein. The cascading processing of
   the biomass resulted in multiple products, including 53 mgg-1 of
   high-value pigments and high-quality biodiesel in accordance with
   American and European standards. The pigment-free and de-fatted residual
   biomass was used as a sole feedstock (30-70 gL-1) to produce enzymes and
   mycoproteins via fungal fermentation employing Aspergillus niger and
   Aspergillus oryzae. Interestingly, A. oryzae produced 28 UmL-1 of
   alpha-amylase and the final residues were mycoproteins after 96 h.
   Furthermore, the strain removed 80-90% of total phosphorous, 90-99% of
   total nitrogen, and significantly lowered the COD, BOD, and TDS of urban
   wastewater. The data demonstrated that P. terebrans has substantial
   potential for resource recovery and could become a candidate for a
   wastewater-derived algal biorefinery.

AB The newest endeavor by the Brazilian State for fostering bioenergy - the
   National Biofuel Policy, or simply RenovaBio - aims at establishing a
   mechanism for the commercialization of decarbonization credits linked to
   the carbon intensity of several biofuels. Under this horizon, this study
   evaluates the prospects for large-scale, integrated sugarcane-microalgae
   biorefineries in terms of their techno-economic and environmental
   feasibility, as well as the possible benefits brought by the RenovaBio
   program. Process integration was based on different energy and material
   vectors obtained from the sugarcane mill, especially the use of
   fermentation-derived CO2, CO2 in biogas, and vinasse as carbon sources
   for microalgae growth. Results show that the co-location of microalgae
   production with sugarcane mills leads to verticalized biorefineries
   currently behind in economic performance in comparison to conventional
   sugarcane mills due to an increase in both fixed and operational
   expenses. Anhydrous ethanol production costs remain in the range of US$
   0.36-0.42/L, below the market price of US$ 0.51/L. Integrating a
   microalgae facility with a sugarcane mill also helps to further improve
   the sustainability of anhydrous ethanol production: cradle-to-grave
   emissions of greenhouse gases fluctuate around 18 g CO2eq/MJ, a
   reduction of 15% in comparison to conventional sugarcane-based ethanol.
   Depending on the scenario, a reasonably-sized integrated biorefinery
   would be able to mitigate around 500 thousand t CO2eq/year when
   displacing gasoline with anhydrous ethanol. The analysis finally points
   out to integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries becoming
   economically feasible at carbon prices as low as US$ 10/t CO2eq under
   the RenovaBio scheme.

   response to the uprising energy crisis, climate change and depletion of
   natural sources. Development of microalgal biofuels from microalgae does
   not satisfy the economic feasibility of overwhelming capital investments
   and operations. Hence, high-value co-products have been produced through
   the extraction of a fraction of algae to improve the economics of a
   microalgae biorefinery. Examples of these high-value products are
   pigments, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins and anti-oxidants,
   with applications in cosmetics, nutritional and pharmaceuticals
   industries. To promote the sustainability of this process, an innovative
   microalgae biorefinery structure is implemented through the production
   of multiple products in the form of high value products and biofuel.
   This review presents the current challenges in the extraction of high
   value products from microalgae and its integration in the biorefinery.
   The economic potential assessment of microalgae biorefinery was
   evaluated to highlight the feasibility of the process.

AB Rapid growth and high carbon-fixation properties make microalgal biomass
   a preferred source of energy-production technologies, particularly
   biodiesel and bioethanol, as well as nutritional supplements and
   pharmaceuticals. Today, microalgal biofuel technology, which is
   continuing to be developed as a surrogate for fossil-fuel technology, is
   the focus of constant research and development, especially regarding
   biomass yield and lipid production. Single stressors on microalgae have
   been commonly examined for efficient biofuel production; however, the
   synergetic effects of stressors on the lipid and biomass productivity of
   microalgae might lead to enhanced lipid properties. In addition,
   considering more than one parameter might be time-consuming; thus, many
   models, such as the surface-response methodology, can enable significant
   optimization of microalgal productivity economically. As well as
   multiple stressors, adaptive stressors considered in "adaptive
   laboratory evolution" could provide robust strains that alter low lipid
   yields. Although the field has progressed substantially in recent years,
   much about microalgae, their biological potential, how to efficiently
   utilize them, and their metabolic responses to various stressors remain
   unknown. Using an extensive review of recent developments in
   single-stress strategies, combined-stress strategies, and adaptive
   stress strategies, this paper gives an overview of recent developments
   in microalgal biofuel production under stress conditions. Further, it
   has also been suggested that an integrated microalgal biorefinery that
   also produces high-value chemicals alongside biofuel might significantly
   enhance its economic feasibility. It is expected that this document will
   provide an understanding of how to develop commercially viable
   microalgae strains for biofuel applications, taking several types of
   stress into consideration.

AB Cassava, the 5th most important staple crop, generates at least 600 L of
   wastewater per ton of processed root. This residue, cassava processing
   wastewater (CPW) has a high chemical oxygen demand, that can reach 56
   g/L, and has also high concentrations of several mineral nutrients. The
   cultivation of microalgae such as Chlorella, Spirulina and wild strains
   was evaluated in the last years in raw, minimally processed and
   partially digested CPW. Concentrations of 2-4 g/L of these microalgae,
   comparable to those obtained in synthetic media, could be reached. The
   BOD of the residue was reduced by up to 92%. This process can be
   integrated into cassava processing industries, if challenges such as the
   toxicity of the concentrated residue, bacterial contamination, and the
   isolation of robust strains are addressed. Because CPW carries about 11%
   of the crop energy, integrating biogas production and microalgal
   cultivation into the cassava processing chain is promising.

AB With conventional fossil energy reserves diminishing as well as
   atmospheric pollution increasing through excessive use of these
   resources, we need to switch to cleaner, renewable replacement sources
   of energy for a sustainable future. Bioenergy is a promising alternative
   among the different renewable energy sources, and microalgae in
   particular are of interest because of their various desirable
   properties. Microalgae can yield a very high lipid content, which can be
   processed to biodiesel. They can capture carbon dioxide and can be grown
   even on degraded land with waste water. Additionally, it is possible to
   generate a variety of products such as ethanol, biogas and
   pharmaceuticals from microalgae. Inspite of these promising attributes,
   its commercial scale implementation has been limited. Here, the major
   challenge is the relatively high cost associated with the entire
   process. Additionally, each of the processing steps exhibits several
   technological challenges. This paper reviews the details of each
   processing step to produce biodiesel from microalgae, with the emphasis
   on the different challenges, bottlenecks and technological barriers, as
   well as possible solutions to them. Various other potential uses of
   microalgae are also briefly discussed. The focus of this review article
   is on the underlying differences between theoretical and practical
   potential of an integrated microalgal biorefinery.

AB The major challenges in commercializing the microalgal products like
   lutein and biofuel are low product yields, and high costs associated
   with cultivation and downstream processes. One of the sustainable
   solutions to this technology challenge is to develop a multi-product
   paradigm or biorefinery model through systematic biomass valorisation.
   In this perspective, this study made efforts to evaluate the best
   performing microalgal strains for concurrent production of two
   high-value products like lutein and phytol, followed by biochemical
   characterization of the strains in terms of protein, carbohydrate and
   lipid. Out of the eighteen different strains grown under
   photoautotrophic mode,Dunaliellasp. CCNM 1161 produced a higher lutein
   (7.84  0.49 mg g-1) and phytol (2.69  0.23 mg g-1) contents with a
   biomass yield of 0.73  0.03 g L-1. Further, on exploring the potential
   strains suitable for the production of valuable biochemical
   compounds,Spirulinasp. CCNM 2132 resulted in higher protein yield of
   35.87  0.49%, whereas, strains likeBracteacoccus pseudominorCCNM 1018
   andNannochloropsissp. CCNM 1034 showed better carbohydrate (33.34 
   0.22%) and lipid (40.2  1.04%) contents, respectively. The potential
   significance of the present study lies in recognizing the promising
   microalgal strains for simultaneous production of two high-value
   bioactive compounds such as lutein and phytol. In addition, this study
   takes a step forward in achieving a multi-product microalgal biorefinery
   model that envisages effective biomass valorisation for cost-effective
   production of high- and low-value products.

AB Climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions
   (mainly carbon dioxide) is one of the major threats of the modern era.
   Primary causes are the high reliance on fossil fuels for power
   generation, transportation, manufacturing and the intensive land usage
   (deforestation). The current share of renewable biofuel production in
   the overall fuel demand has been found insufficient to replace fossil
   fuels. Microalgae can deliver a sustainable and complementary biofuel
   platform with some important advantages. This review aims to offer a
   state-of-the art review of algal biomass conversion methods into various
   biofuel products, including biodiesel, syngas, biogas, bioethanol.
   Emerging more sustainable biofuel/bioenergy production technologies are
   highlighted. Attention is also paid to sustainable cultivation methods,
   including wastewater treatment and bioremediation to capture CO2and fix
   nitrogen and phosphorus, produced from industrial, agricultural and
   municipal sources. Finally, a light is shed on the important role of
   algae metabolic engineering.

AB Algae are an attractive, alternative renewable source for biofuel
   production compared to biomass from food crops or cellulosic materials.
   Marine algae do not need fresh water or arable land and, thus,
   production of marine algae does not compete with food production. In
   contrast to biofuel production from microalgae, the use of macroalgal
   biomass as feedstock for biofuel production is still in its infancy.
   This study presents an environmental assessment of bioethanol from
   onshore grown green seaweed using the life cycle assessment (LCA)
   methodology. The environmental assessment is based on data from
   literature and initial laboratory scale experiments, as industrial scale
   facilities for bioethanol production from macroalgae do not exist.
   Alternative systems are compared to the reference system and the limits
   of the LCA are discussed with respect to the co-product management
   (allocation vs. substitution) in the LCA model. Impact assessment
   results showed that nutrients for seaweed growth and electricity
   consumption by the culture system were the main contributors to the
   environmental burdens of the reference system. Bioethanol from onshore
   cultivated green seaweed turned out to be an environmentally efficient
   biofuel compared to fossil fuel and bioethanol from sugarcane. The type
   of co-product management selected in LCA largely affected the impact
   assessment results.

AB The aim of this thesis is therefore to obtain a quantitative
   understanding of the physiology of TAG production that is induced by
   nitrogen starvation. Microalgae produce a large variety of
   lipid-classes. Only part of these lipids are triacylglycerols or other
   fatty acyl-lipids (fatty acid containing lipids). Chapter 2 describes an
   analytical method to analyse the fatty acid content and composition in
   microalgae. This analytical procedure is based on a sequence of
   mechanical cell disruption, solvent based lipid extraction in
   chloroform:methanol, transesterification of fatty acids to fatty acid
   methyl esters (FAMEs), and identification and quantification of FAMEs
   using gas chromatography (GC-FID). In chapter 3, differences and
   similarities between microalgae species with respect to their response
   to nitrogen starvation were investigated with the aim to select a
   promising microalga for TAG production. From a literature survey among
   96 microalgae species, nine promising species were selected (Chlorella
   vulgaris,C. zofingiensis,Dunaliella tertiolecta,Isochrysis
   galbana,Nannochlorissp.,Neochloris oleoabundans,Porphyridium
   cruentum,Phaeodactylum tricornutumandScenedesmus obliquus). The biomass
   productivity and TAG production of these species were investigated in
   detail during both nitrogen replete and nitrogen depleted conditions.
   Chapter 4 continues withS. obliquus, and describes how the light
   intensity, pH, and temperature affect the response ofS. obliquusto
   nitrogen starvation, and associated TAG production. In chapter 5,
   carbon-partitioning was therefore investigated in both the wild-type and
   the slm1 starchless mutant ofS. obliquus. Further, the mechanism behind
   the simultaneous starch and TAG production was investigated in more
   detail in chapter 6. Using the insights from the previous chapters and
   existing literature, a mechanistic model was developed, in chapter 7,
   that describes TAG production during nitrogen starvation. This model
   constitutes of a photosynthesis module and a carbon partitioning module.
   In addition, it describes the interconversion of starch to TAG. Chapter
   8 evaluates the outcomes of techno-economic and life cycle analysis
   (LCA) studies that investigated the cost-price and net energy ratio of
   microalgal products. Most of these studies use biodiesel production from
   microalgal TAGs as their case study. These studies conclude that with
   current technology, the cost-price for biodiesel is too high and that
   more energy is consumed in the production process than what is produced
   in the form of biodiesel. It was also found that the biomass
   productivity and biochemical composition associated with the cultivation
   of microalgae are large uncertainties in the input for these studies.
   This chapter therefore presents several scenarios for microalgal
   cultivation (various products). For each scenario, productivities,
   biochemical compositions, and nutrient requirements are provided that
   can be used as more realistic input values for techno-economic and LCA
   studies. These values are derived from the outcomes of the previous
   chapters. It was concluded that the TAG productivity is commonly
   overestimated by 3 to 6-fold in techno-economic and LCA studies.
   According to these studies, approximately half of the costs and energy
   are used in the cultivation step. It was therefore concluded that these
   techno-economic and LCA studies underestimate the cost-price and energy
   consumption by 2 to 3.5-fold. The future improvements in productivity
   that might be accomplished according to chapter 7, could potentially
   improve the productivity such that it approaches the productivity that
   is commonly assumed as the base-case in current techno-economic and LCA
   studies. These advances in productivity can thus help to reduce the
   cost-price and specific energy consumption, but in addition, a reduction
   in costs and energy consumption of photobioreactors is needed before
   microalgal TAG production can be commercialized. Altogether, this thesis
   provides a quantitative understanding of the factors that influence
   photosynthesis and carbon partitioning during nitrogen starvation.

AB Constantly rising energy demands, finite fossil fuel reserves and
   deteriorating environmental conditions have invoked worldwide interest
   to explore the sustainable sources of renewable biofuels. Locally
   adapted photosynthetic oleaginous microalgae with rapid growth on
   variable temperatures could be an ideal way for bioremediating the
   wastewater (WW) while producing the feedstock for biodiesel. To test
   this notion, an unknown strain was isolated from a sewage fed lake
   (Neela-Hauz). It was discerned as Chlorella sorokiniana-I using the 16S
   rDNA and 18S rDNA barcodes. The culture conditions such as pH,
   illumination, different temperature ranges and growth medium were
   cohesively optimized prior to the assessment of C. sorokiniana-I's
   efficacy to remediate the WW and biodiesel production. The strain has
   thrived well up to 40°C when continuously grown for 15 days. The highest
   lipid accumulation and biomass productivity were recorded in 100% WW.
   Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content was observed to be more than
   twice in WW (47%), compared to control synthetic media, TAP (20%) and
   BG11 (10%), which indicate the importance of this new isolate for
   producing economically viable biodiesel. Moreover, it is highly
   efficient in removing the total nitrogen (77%), total phosphorous (81%),
   iron (67%) and calcium (42%) from the WW. The quality of WW was
   considerably improved by reducing the overall chemical oxygen demand
   (48%), biological oxygen demand (47%) and alkalinity (15%). Thus, C.
   sorokiniana-I could be an ideal alga for the tropical countries in the
   remediation of WW while producing feedstock for biodiesel in a
   cost-effective manner.

AB In the past few years, microalgae have gained huge recognition from the
   scientific community due to their potential applications in the
   production of a broad array of bio-based products varying from biofuels
   to nanoparticles. Due to their elevated growth rate, high tolerance to
   various types of abiotic stresses, and complex metabolic capacity,
   microalgae can be used as promising tools for the attainment of a
   circular bioeconomy. Moreover, they can simply utilize nutrients from
   wastewater for biorefinery purposes, resulting in resource recovery
   coupled with wastewater treatment. However, due to their sub-optimal
   yields and high production costs, microalgae-based bio-products have not
   yet been commercialized. This review provides insights into the
   employment of microalgae as an efficient bioresource for the treatment
   of wastewater with simultaneous enactment as a biorefinery to produce
   biofuels, biochar, bioplastic, fertilizers, and other high-value
   bioproducts. Furthermore, the application of microalgal nanoparticles in
   wastewater treatment and prospects for genetic modification of
   microalgae for enhanced biorefinery capabilities have also been briefly
   highlighted.

   Gram-negative bacteria with a long evolutionary history and the only
   prokaryotes that perform plant-like oxygenic photosynthesis.
   Cyanobacteria possess several advantages as host for biotechnological
   applications, The use of photosynthetic cyanobacteria to directly
   convert carbon dioxide to biofuels are now considered as important
   renewable energy alternatives for petroleum-based fuels, like biofuels,
   biogas, bioethanol or biodiesel. Equipped with the ability to degrade
   environmental pollutants and remove heavy metals, cyanobacteria are
   promising tools for bioremediation and waste water treatment. In field
   of agriculture, cyanobacteria is used as nitrogen fixing bio fertilizer,
   bioremediation CO2 sequestration and biofuel production. In this review,
   the potential of cyanobacteria as sources of energy, bioactive
   compounds, high-value chemicals and tools for aquatic bioremediation and

AB The characteristics and performance of algae-bacteria granular consortia
   which cultivated with aerobic granules and targeted algae (Chlorella and
   Scenedesmus), and the essential difference between granular consortia
   and aerobic granules were investigated in this experiment. The result
   indicated that algae-bacteria granular consortia could be successfully
   developed, and the algae present in the granular consortia were mainly
   Chlorella and Scenedesmus. Although the change of chlorophyll
   composition revealed the occurrence of light limitation for algal
   growth, the granular consortia could maintain stable granular structure,
   and even showed better settling property than aerobic granules. Total
   nitrogen and phosphate in the algal-bacterial granular system showed
   better removal efficiencies (50.2% and 35.7%) than those in the aerobic
   granular system (32.8% and 25.6%) within one cycle (6 h). The biodiesel
   yield of aerobic granules could be significantly improved by algal
   coupled process, yet methyl linolenate and methyl palmitoleate were the
   dominant composition of biodiesel obtained from granular consortia and
   aerobic granules, respectively. Meanwhile, the difference of dominant
   bacterial communities in the both granules was found at the order level
   and family level, and alpha diversity indexes revealed the granular
   consortia had a higher microbial diversity.

VL 414

U1 3
U2 22
AB The use of biodiesel blended with petro-diesel reduces emissions of
   carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and particulate matter
   significantly. It also promotes sustainability across the supply chain
   and has the potential to create a carbon-neutral bioeconomy. However,
   the sector has had difficulty in production capacities due to a lack of
   sufficient feedstock thus questioning the bioprocesses' economic
   viability and blending targets. In particular, global biodiesel
   production was 43.4 billion liters in 2021, which is significantly less
   than bioethanol production which totaled 117 billion liters. To improve
   biodiesel production, feedstock such as non-edible tree-borne oils,
   microalgae, and oleaginous yeasts need to be refined through metabolic
   engineering and the process needs to be optimized for maximal
   production. In addition, the discovery of sustainable and low-cost
   catalysts certainly fosters the greening of the transesterification
   process, making it more cost-effective. This review examines the entire
   biodiesel industry, focusing on a variety of feedstocks and their recent
   improvements, as well as advancements in the production process.
   Finally, the review offers a critical viewpoint on how to achieve
   sustainability and circularity in the biodiesel industry's future.

U1 4

AB Microalgae are sources of nutritional products and biofuels. However,
   their economical processing is challenging, because of (i) the
   inherently low concentration of biomass in algal cultures, below 0.5%,
   (ii) the high-water content in the harvested biomass, above 70%; and
   (iii) the variable intracellular content and composition. Cell wall
   structure and strength vary enormously among microalgae, from naked
   Dunaliella cells to robust Haematococcus cysts. High-value products
   justify using fast and energy-intensive processes, ranging from 0.23
   kWh/kg dry biomass in high-pressure homogenization, to 6 kWh/kg dry
   biomass in sonication. However, in biofuels production, the energy input
   must be minimized, requiring slower, thermal or chemical pretreatments.
   Whichever the primary fraction of interest, the spent biomass can be
   processed into valuable by-products. This review discusses microalgal
   cell structure and composition, how it affects pretreatment, focusing on
   technologies tested for large scale or promising for industrial
   processes, and how these can be integrated into algal biorefineries.

AB Algae biomass comprises variety of biochemicals components such as
   carbohydrates, lipids and protein, which make them a feasible feedstock
   for biofuel production. However, high production cost mainly due to
   algae cultivation remains the main challenge in commercializing algae
   biofuels. Hence, extraction of other high value-added bioproducts from
   algae biomass is necessary to enhance the economic feasibility of algae
   biofuel production. This paper is aims to deliberate the recent
   developments of conventional technologies for algae biofuels production,
   such as biochemical and chemical conversion pathways, and extraction of
   a variety of bioproducts from algae biomass for various potential
   applications. Besides, life cycle evaluation studies on microalgae
   biorefinery are presented, focusing on case studies for various
   cultivation techniques, culture medium, harvesting, and dewatering
   techniques along with biofuel and bioenergy production pathways.
   Overall, the algae biorefinery provides new opportunities for

   more cultivation of cyanobacteria and microalgae species are waiting for
   new biotechnological applications. At present, the global demand for
   microalgal applications is focused on biofuels including biodiesel and
   bioethanol apart from a handful (mentioned above) of bioactive compounds
   which are mostly used as nutraceuticals. Thus, microalgal biorefinery is
   growing rapidly for multiple commodities production from both
   conventional and photobioreactor-based cultivation for biomass

AB Microalgae biorefinery systems have been extensively studied from the
   perspective of resources, energy expenditure, biofuel production
   potential, and high-added value products. The genus Spirulina
   (Arthrospira) stands out among the microalgae of commercial importance.
   It accounts for over 30% of biomass produced globally because of high
   protein concentration and, carotenoid and phycocyanin content. Spirulina
   cultivation can be used to reduce greenhouse gases and for effluent
   treatment. Furthermore, its cellular morphology facilitates biomass
   recovery, which contributes to the process cost reduction. Spirulina
   biomass is widely applicable in food, feed, cosmetics, biofertilizers,
   biofuels, and biomaterials. A feasibility analysis of Spirulina
   biorefinery would provide specific information for the decision-making
   for the improvement of the Spirulina production process. In that
   context, this review aimed to present a parameter assessment to
   contribute to the economic viability of Spirulina production in a
   biorefinery system.

PS 101-109
PY 2017
U1 4
U2 140
AB One of the main problems of microalgae lipids is their high content of
   free fatty acids (FFAs), which creates problems of soap formation during
   homogeneous alkali transesterification. The main purpose of this study
   was to test heterogeneous catalysts to transform the FFAs from a oil
   (oleic acid+canola oil) used as a model and from microalgae lipids
   (Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella protothecoides) into biodiesel.
   Under the conditions tested (temperature: 120°C, autogenous pressure,
   reaction time: 60 min, methanol to lipid ratio: 0.57 mL/g and 2.5 wt%
   Amberlyst-15 relative to microalgae lipids), Chlorella protothecoides
   lipids allowed to reach a higher conversion (84%) compared to
   Scenedesmus obliquus lipids (34%). However, the study showed that both
   microalgae lipids suffered from mass transfer limitations, due to
   impurities, because FFAs conversions higher than 90% were obtained with
   the model oils (20-33 wt% FFAs in canola oil). Despite the fact that the
   FFAs from both microalgae were suitable to produce biodiesel, further
   studies must be made on alkali transesterification of the remaining
   lipids still present in microalgae biodiesel and on crude lipid
   purification in order to limit the mass transfer problems.

AB Nannochloropsis is attracting renewed interest due to member species'
   potential application as sustainable feedstocks in biofuel production
   and high-value compounds. This genus is rapidly emerging as a model for
   research on algal biofuel production as it is predicted to have great
   potential in the bioenergy sector. The handful of known species in this
   genus has been heavily investigated for fuel purposes owing to their
   high lipid content, biomass production and highly efficient homologous
   recombination system. This review reveals advances in the aspects of
   Nannochloropsis growth, cultivation systems, harvesting and biorefinery
   technologies associated with lipid production (mainly neutral lipids)
   over the past few years. We also present recent advances in
   high-throughput techniques that generate highly accurate datasets and
   thus advanced improvement in lipid production. Here, we aim to provide
   useful information to further the development of Nannochloropsis as a
   cost-effective biofuel feedstock.

AB In recent years, microalgae-based carbon-neutral biofuels (i.e.,
   biodiesel) have gained considerable interest due to high growth rate and
   higher lipid productivity of microalgae during the whole year,
   delivering continuous biomass production as compared to vegetable-based
   feedstocks. Therefore, biodiesel was synthesized from three different
   microalgal species, namely Tetraselmis sp. (Chlorophyta) and
   Nannochloropsis oculata and Phaeodactylum tricornutum
   (Heterokontophyta), and the fuel properties of the biodiesel were
   analytically determined, unlike most studies which rely on estimates
   based on the lipid profile of the microalgae. These include density,
   kinematic viscosity, total and free glycerol, and high heating value
   (HHV), while cetane number (CN) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP)
   were estimated based on the fatty acid methyl ester profile of the
   biodiesel samples instead of the lipid profile of the microalgae. Most
   biodiesel properties abide by the ASTM D6751 and the EN 14214
   specifications, although none of the biodiesel samples met the minimum
   CN or the maximum content of polyunsaturated fatty acids with ≥4 double
   bonds as required by the EN 14214 reference value. On the other hand,
   bomb calorimetric experiments revealed that the heat of combustion of
   all samples was on the upper limit expected for biodiesel fuels,
   actually being close to that of petrodiesel. Post-production processing
   may overcome the aforementioned limitations, enabling the production of
   biodiesel with high HHV obtained from lipids present in these
   microalgae.

AB The production of renewable energy has become an important element in
   worldwide energy policy aimed to reduce greenhouse gases caused by
   fossil fuels. Biodiesel derived from transesterification of vegetable
   oil or animal fats, with alcohol in the presence of catalyst has been
   considered as one of the alternative resources to replace fossil fuels.
   However, the biodiesel produced from these materials may not be enough
   for total replacement; hence microalgae are used as another potential
   alternative due to their high photosynthetic efficiency and biomass
   productivity. In this study, a microalgae species i.e. Chlorella
   vulgaris UMACC 001 having high oil to biomass ratio was cultured,
   harvested and characterised. It showed very high growth rate, (0.29 per
   day) and biomass productivity (0.14 mg litre per day). In addition, the
   resulting algal oil showed almost equal amount of saturated fatty acid
   (48.9%) and unsaturated fatty acid (51.1%). When converted to biodiesel,
   the ester content was 68.9% and comparable with that produced in
   previous study (71.0%). Thus, Chlorella vulgaris can be considered as a
   potential feedstock for biofuel production in the future.

AB Algae are fast-growing, microscopic, and eukaryotic organisms that can
   perform photosynthesis, and simultaneously fix atmospheric CO2. Algal
   cells contain high quantity of biofuel precursors such as starch and
   lipid granules. In the past decades, microalgal biomass has emerged as a
   potential feedstock for bioenergy generation. In the current scenario,
   it is being extensively explored to produce liquid (bioethanol,
   biodiesel) and gaseous (biomethane, biohydrogen) fuels. Algal technology
   has four crucial aspects including strain selection and its cultivation,
   harvesting techniques, conversion routes, and pretreatment of biomass.
   The quality and quantity of biomass, available media source, cultivation
   system as well as environmental conditions collectively help in the
   selection of the specific algal strain. Despite several in-depth
   attempts, there are various hurdles and limitations to make algal
   biofuel technically and economically viable. To meet the operational and
   economic feasibility, a collective approach is desirable. The present
   state-of-the-art review deals with all four crucial aspects of algal
   technology. The manuscript especially covers the significant methods of
   harvesting, energy conversion, and pretreatment. Moreover, it also
   revels the advantage of biological agent mediated harvesting, energy
   conversion and the pretreatment of algal biomass for sustainable biofuel
   recovery. The prime objective of this review is to give an insight into
   the aspects of algal technology to promote collective research in the
   area of algal biofuel.

AB The quest for viable and scalable biofuel sources has been at the
   forefront of scientific innovation for the past three decades. Due to
   its rich chemical constituents, microalgal biomass has emerged as a
   pivotal sustainable and scalable feedstock for biorefineries. This
   comprehensive review critically analyzes the different types of
   microalgae feedstock, concurrent extraction technologies,
   bio-pre-treatment procedures, and the key chemical and physical
   parameters influencing lipid formation and algal biofuel production. We
   propose a novel approach of photo-initiated culturing of algal biomass
   using photobioreactors (PBRs) to address the limitations of concurrent
   space and time-related constraints. The innovative photo bio-refinery
   strategy presented herein aims to enhance sustainability factors while
   minimizing emissions, catering to the needs of futuristic non-electric
   vehicles. A comparative quality analysis of microalgae-derived biofuel
   against conventional fossil fuels and other biofuels is conducted,
   considering chemical, environmental, economic, and social perspectives.
   Furthermore, we elucidate the efficacy of bio-pre-treatment strategies
   such as dehydration, hydrothermal liquefaction, pyrolysis, and
   gasification in optimizing biofuel production. The proposed photo
   biorefineries exhibit the potential to yield a diverse range of
   value-added products, including biodiesel, biogases, bio-fertilizers,
   bio-pesticides, bio-alcohols, dyes, proteins, carotenoids, and drug
   vitals. This review provides a comprehensive framework for the
   development of sustainable and efficient microalgae-based biorefineries,
   paving the way for a greener and more economically viable future in the

AB In the energy sector, bioenergy has been utilized as a replacement for
   non-renewable resources. Due to the depletion of resources, mankind may
   face adversities in the future. To overcome these challenges,
   sustainable and reliable bioenergy-based alternatives are to be used.
   Bioenergy sources are bio-based alternatives that have become acceptable
   in society for their renewability, sustainability, and environmentally
   friendly characteristics, but they still lag in the energy market due to
   their less cost-effective output of upstream and downstream processing
   in comparison with age-old fossil fuels. This review provides a detailed
   overview of their techno-economic and life cycle assessment, their
   positioning and competition in the energy market, and the strategies
   that might assist them in overcoming the market challenges. Microalgal
   bioenergy products have been lifting their market positioning at a
   slower rate that is almost unnoticeable, but their assistance in
   becoming a better solution against adversities of energy resource
   depletion in the future makes them quite promising. The new research
   alternatives for microalgal biomass conversion in biorefinery products
   for bioenergy production, which are based on combating pollution and
   reuse of waste products, along with the strategic application for
   combating the energy market competition, have also been highlighted.

SO Industrial Crops and Products
VL 154

U1 6
U2 94
AB The bio-based refinery has evolved as a strong alternative to the
   fossil-based refinery. Fossil fuels have been critical to meet the
   global energy and chemical needs. The rapid utilization of fossil fuel
   reserves and environmental deterioration has led to the search for
   alternative sources. The naturally occurring biomass (forest residues,
   microalgae), and waste biomass generated through different anthropogenic
   activity (agricultural residues, industrial wastes) have emerged as a
   potential substitute for the fossil fuels. These biomasses consists of
   complex polymers such as cellulose, lignin, hemicelluloses, starch,
   pectin, lipids that can be used as starting material for fuels and
   building block chemicals. This biomass can be converted to suitable
   liquid or gaseous fuel and essential chemicals through a series of
   steps. Such an approach is called bio-based refinery as analogous to the
   petroleum refinery. The role of different hydrolytic enzymes is
   important to the biobased refinery. These enzymes act on different
   biomass components and result in the generation of specific oligomers
   and monomers. These oligomeric and monomeric compounds are subsequently
   converted to biofuels and biochemicals. The enzymes are industrially
   produced by various microorganisms and have characteristics of
   structural and mechanistic properties. There are several limitations
   associated with the application of enzymes in biorefineries. Therefore,
   to overcome the existing limitations of enzyme-based technologies in
   biorefinery there is a need to understand the current status of these
   hydrolyzing enzymes and enzyme-mediated technologies. The review will
   first give an insight into enzyme structure, mode of action, and its
   current role in the biobased biorefinery. This review also focuses on
   recent advances, techno-economic and environmental concerns associated
   with enzyme assisted biobased refinery. The review suggests that the
   application of the advanced biotechnological approach can help in the
   development of a consolidated bioprocessing approach. This approach will
   further lead to futuristic and self-sustainable "integrated
   biorefineries" that can fulfill the dream of "circular bioeconomy" with
   zero-waste.

AB This study analyzed the algal biodiesel production system via dry-route,
   based on Chlorella vulgaris cultivated in raceways, by comparing the Net
   Energy Balance (NEB) and the Fossil Energy Ratio (FER) of five
   scenarios: C0 (single system of biomass production); C1 (C0 + pyrolysis
   of the microalgae press cake); C2 (C0 + anaerobic co-digestion of the
   microalgae press cake); C3 and C4 (same conditions of C1 and C2, but
   integrating both scenarios into an autonomous ethanol distillery). Each
   scenario was analyzed under de perspective of energy allocation (a) and
   system expansion with avoided product (b). The results showed that with
   the energy allocation, only C3a and C4a improved the values of baseline
   scenario (C0a) for NEB, in 120% and 72% respectively. When the system
   expansion is considered, none of the scenarios was better than the
   respective baseline scenario (C0b), in relation to the NEB. Considering
   the FER, C3a increased in 3.4% the values of C0a, while C3b and C4b
   increased the values of C0b in 54.1% and 28.8%, respectively. In
   general, system expansion showed the best scenarios: for the NEB C0b
   showed the highest average values while C3b showed the highest average
   values for the FER.

AB Biodiesel from microalgae has the potential to completely replace
   petroleum based transport fuels without negatively affecting food and
   other crop products. Pilot scale studies were carried out with
   indigenous hyper lipid producing microalgal isolates viz., Botryococcus
   sp. and Tetradesmus wisconsinensis, isolated from freshwater and marine
   sources of Tamil Nadu, India in an indigenously designed tubular
   photobioreactor. The bioreactor injected with 1% CO2 level daily
   increased the biomass by 10 times and lipid to 33% during 15 days'
   growth period, which can be further trans-esterified into biodiesel.
   Microalgal biomass and biodiesel production costs were calculated by
   considering important cost factors like centrifugation, labor charges,
   carbon dioxide costs etc. The production cost was worked out as ₹ 34.79
   for one liter of biodiesel. At this cost level, biodiesel production by
   using microalgae seems to be promising technology. The fuel properties
   estimated from biodiesel are almost on par with the fossil fuel. The
   benefits cost ratio was worked out to be 1.72.

SO Applied Energy
VL 265
PY 2020
U1 0
U2 32
AB This research suggests a three-stage model framework for the design of a
   microalgae-based biofuel supply chain to meet the goal of economic
   commercialization. First, the design stage decides the spatial layouts
   and dimensions of each scale of biorefineries and economic analyses are
   done to estimate the capital costs and operating costs for different
   design options. Using the spatial dimensions determined in the first
   stage, the second stage selects the candidate locations for the
   biorefineries using an geographic information system (GIS) based site
   evaluation. This stage screens the available land area for the
   biorefineries, and also reduces the computational burden of the latter
   stage. In the mathematical optimization stage, a mixed-integer linear
   programming optimization model is formulated to make multi-period
   strategic and tactical decisions of the supply chain under the total
   cost minimization objective. Since the formulated problem is
   computationally intensive, a two-stage decomposition solution strategy
   is proposed to solve the problem in a reasonable time. The model
   framework is demonstrated through a case study cast in Texas, U.S., with
   a time horizon of ten years, using the suggested decomposition method.
   As a result, the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of microalgae-based
   biodiesel is calculated as $10.92/galbiodiesel, which is about three
   times higher than the current biodiesel price $3.51/galbiodiesel. To
   reduce the cost, the strategies of biomass storage and maximum delivery
   are investigated to deal with the productivity fluctuation. In the
   scenario analysis, the underutilization of production capacities is
   alleviated resulting in reduced MFSP of $7.90/galbiodiesel,
   $7.92/galbiodiesel, and $7.43/galbiodiesel respectively. Clearly, for
   economic feasibility, the production cost should be further reduced by
   developing more cost-efficient technologies and integrating high-value
   coproducts into the biorefinery portfolio.

AB Recent advancement in biophotovoltaic systems using microalgae, coupled
   with biorefinery approach, would improve economy-feasibility in
   production. The major concern is its commercial strength in terms of
   scalability, strain selection and extraction procedure cost. It must
   compete with conventional feedstocks such as fossil fuels. This project
   proposes to enhance the economic feasibility of microalgae-based
   biorefinery by evaluating their performance for bio-electricity,
   bio-diesel and carotenoids production in a single cycle. The first part
   of the study was to construct and select a Bio-bottle Voltaic (BBV)
   device that would allow microalgae to grow and produce bioproducts, as
   well as generate the maximum current output reading derived from the
   microalgae's photosynthesis process. The second phase consisted of a
   25-day investigation into the biorefinery performance of six different
   microalgal species in producing bio-electricity, bio-diesel and
   carotenoid in a prototype BBV device. The prototype BBV device with
   aluminium foil and pencil lead as its anode and cathode produced the
   highest carotenoid and biodiesel component production from the two
   microalgae tested, according to the results of the first phase of the
   experiment. In the second portion of the
   study,ScenedesmusdimorphusandChlorella vulgariswere identified as the
   two microalgae most capable of maintaining their growth throughout the
   experiment. The maximum current reading observed forC. vulgariswas 653
   mV. High Performance Liquid Chromatography analysis showed four major
   carotenoid compounds found which were Neoxanthin, Cantaxanthin,
   Astaxanthin and 9-cis antheraxanthin, and the highest carotenoid
   producer wasC. vulgariswhich recorded at 1.73 mug/mL.C. vulgarisrecorded
   as the most alkanes producer with 22 compounds detected and Heptacosane
   and Heneicosane as the two major biodiesel compounds found in the
   extracts. Evaluation ofC. vulgarisdata showed that it has enormous
   potential for microalgal biorefinery candidates. Further ongoing
   research and development efforts forC. vulgariswill improve the economic
   viability of microalgae-based industries and reduce reliance on depleted
   fossil fuels.

AB Despite strong governmental support, microalgae biodiesel has failed to
   report rapid growth in China. Thus, it is imperative to conduct an
   economic analysis on microalgae biodiesel so that useful inputs could be
   provided for policy making. The analysis is based on a model with a
   100-ha production facility. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is
   performed in this study to determine critical factors contributing to
   the economic feasibility of microalgae biodiesel. Furthermore, a
   learning curve is employed to predict the production cost from 2019 to
   2022. The production cost is estimated as USD 2.29/kg, which is
   significantly higher than that of commercial diesel. The findings
   highlight that biodiesel projects lack economic feasibility and the main
   barriers are microalgae productivity, annual operating days and product
   benefits. According to the learning curve prediction, these issues
   cannot be alleviated within a short period, particularly considering the
   limitations associated with the current policies. The study concludes
   with policy implications e.g. a policy system to facilitate the
   development of microalgae biodiesel.

AB In this paper, an alternative means for nitrogen fixation that may
   consume less energy and release less greenhouse gases than the
   Haber-Bosch process is explored. A life-cycle assessment was conducted
   on a process to: culture the cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. ATCC 33047, in
   open ponds; harvest the biomass and exopolysaccharides and convert these
   to biogas; strip and convert the ammonia from the biogas residue to
   ammonium sulfate; dry the ammonium sulfate solution to ammonium sulfate
   crystals and transport the finished product. The results suggest that
   substantial reductions in non-renewable energy use and greenhouse gas
   emissions may be realized. The study opens the possibility that
   Haber-Bosch ammonia may be replaced with ammonia from a biomass process
   which simultaneously generates renewable energy. The process is
   intrinsically safer than the Haber-Bosch process. However, there are
   trade-offs in terms of land use and possibly, water.

AB In this study, we compared the performances of four different gas
   chromatography (GC) based microalgal fatty acid analysis methods that
   are typically applied to biorefinery research using wastewater-adapted
   microalgae. Compared with the HP-5-type non-polar column, WAX-type polar
   columns exhibited excellent abilities to quantitatively separate C16-C18
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from selected wastewater-adapted
   microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Ankistrodesmus gracilis and Scenedesmus
   quadricauda) isolates. GC-mass spectroscopy (MS) using the WAX-type
   polar column provided the strongest detection sensitivity among the
   tested methods by lowest detection limit, and GC-flame ionized detector
   (FID) with the same polar column exhibited nearly consistent results to
   GC-MS analysis. Our statistical comparison of microalgal fatty acid
   composition profiles generated using various GC methods, microalgal
   resources and culture media (wastewater, BG11 and nitrogen limitation)
   suggested that an appropriate GC method and algal resource choice are
   more important than the optimization of culture conditions to evaluate
   the applicability of microalgal biorefinery using wastewater resources.

AB The integration of microalgae cultivation in anaerobic digestion (AD)
   plants can take advantage of relevant nutrients (ammonium and
   ortho-phosphate) and CO2loads. The proposed scheme of microalgae
   integration in existing biogas plants aims at producing approximately
   250 t.y-1of microalgal biomass, targeting the biostimulants market that
   is currently under rapid expansion. A full-scale biorefinery was
   designed to treat 50 kt.y-1of raw liquid digestate from AD and 0.45
   kt.y-1of CO2from biogas upgrading, and 0.40 kt.y-1of sugar-rich solid
   by-products from a local confectionery industry. An innovative
   three-stage cultivation process was designed, modelled, and verified,
   including: (i) microalgae inoculation in tubular PBRs to select the
   desired algal strains, (ii) microalgae cultivation in raceway ponds
   under greenhouses, and (iii) heterotrophic microalgae cultivation in
   fermenters. A detailed economic assessment of the proposed biorefinery
   allowed to compute a biomass production cost of 2.8  0.3 .kg DW-1, that
   is compatible with current downstream process costs to produce
   biostimulants, suggesting that the proposed nutrient recovery route is
   feasible from the technical and economic perspective. Based on the case
   study analysis, a discussion of process, bioproducts and policy barriers
   that currently hinder the development of microalgae-based biorefineries
   is presented.

AB Fossil fuel continued overuse and carbon emissions issues have prompted
   increased research efforts on sustainable and renewable energy sources
   as alternative to fossil fuels. Biofuels include products derived from
   biomasses or their residues, such as: biogas, biodiesel, bioethanol,
   biomethanol, synthetic biofuels, biohydrogen and vegetable oil. Due to
   their properties, all of these may be used in conventional engines as
   produced, or blended with fossil fuels. First and second generation
   biofuels may be produced from a large variety of feedstocks, including
   food crops such as sugar beet, sugar cane, sorghum, energy-crops, such
   as lignocellulosic masses, and waste, like the organic fraction of
   municipal solid waste, or landfill leachate. In the last decade, a third
   generation of biofuels has emerged, i.e. those derived from microalgae.
   Even though their yield is higher, and their greenhouse gas footprint
   lower than previous generations', they still need large amounts of water
   and nutrients for production. In this paper, the most common biofuels
   (biogas, syngas, biodiesel, bioethanol and biobutanol) are reviewed and
   analyzed with particular attention on their carbon and water footprints
   and economic sustainability perspective.

AB The triad of environmental, energy and economic security are the key
   issues for the sustainability of a real sense developmental process,
   which are now being seriously jeopardized with our impetuous activities.
   Various options of generating renewable energy alternatives are being
   explored due to the growing concern of diminishing fossil fuel reserves
   and their contributions towards the enrichment of air with major
   Greenhouse Gas CO2, which induce serious environmental consequences. An
   elevated level of CO2 in the atmosphere is chiefly responsible for the
   warming of global climate. Adoptions of effective mitigation strategies
   with clean energy development are therefore need of the hour for the
   sustainability of the developmental processes. Alternative fuel
   productions from renewable photosynthetic biological sources have the
   potential to provide an environment friendly sustainable energy system
   for the society besides mitigating CO2. The use of biomass for energy is
   largely motivated from the stand point of global energy crisis and
   global environmental issues. Alternative fuels that derived from biomass
   would reduce GHGs concentration potentially and could replace fossil
   fuels currently being used. Biodiesel is a clean burning renewable
   liquid biofuel, currently gaining worldwide acceptance as an able
   alternative to petroleum fuel. Biodiesel fuel production from microalgae
   has attracted much attention in recent times as a promising
   bio-feedstock for alternative liquid fuel production over other
   non-edible oil seed crops owing to their higher oil yielding efficiency,
   faster growth rate, higher CO2 fixation and wide range of tolerance to
   varying environmental conditions. Large scale cultivation of microalgae
   for liquid biofuel production with an integrated and innovative approach
   for feeding CO2 generated by industrial process using sewage/waste water
   might be an optimal solution to global warming, rising fuel crisis and
   saving our precious fresh water resources. The efficiency of microalgal
   liquid biofuel production largely depends on the selection of potent
   strains and appropriate technology. Exploration of the existing
   microalgal biodiversity has therefore a key role in finding an
   appropriate strain for sustainable production of biodiesel. India is
   facing formidable challenges in meeting its energy demands and in
   providing adequate energy of desired quality in various forms in a
   sustainable manner and at competitive prices. India produces only 22% of
   the mineral fuel requirement of a year and the rest is imported at a
   huge cost of foreign money. With the escalating crude oil prices in the
   international market and to ward off Global Warming that threatens our
   very existence, it is pertinent that India's need for biofuel
   development is the order of the day. India has vast expanse of waste and
   marginal land, tropical climate and vast manpower for developing
   sustainable biodiesel production towards its national energy security.
   The North Eastern region of India, more particularly Assam has an
   ambient of harboring rich diversity of freshwater microalgae. There was
   no earlier record regarding the oleaginous microalgae of the region.
   Accordingly a study was conducted and 22 microalgal species were
   isolated and screened for oil content. Among the isolated microalgae,
   Botryococcus braunii, Ankistrodesmus sp., Scenedesmus sp., Euglena sp.,
   Navicula sp. and Nitzchia sp. are a few oleaginous microalgae noteworthy
   for biodiesel production. Hydrocarbon and lipids were quantitatively
   evaluated and measured gravimetrically in cultured B. braunii
   (21.9-60.7%), Ankistrodesmus sp. (55%), Chlorococcum sp. (11.3-12.2%)
   and Scenedesmus sp. (17.3%) following standard procedure.

AB With a target production of 1000 ton of dry algae/yr, lipid content of
   30 wt.%, and productivity of 30 g/m2-d in a 340-day annual operation,
   four common scenarios of microalgae bioenergy routes were assessed in
   terms of cost, energy, and CO2 inputs and outputs. Scenario 1 (biodiesel
   production), Scenario 2 (Scenario 1 with integrated anaerobic digestion
   system), Scenario 3 (biogas production), and Scenario 4 (supercritical
   gasification) were evaluated. Scenario 4 outperformed other scenarios in
   terms of net energy production (1282.42 kWh/ton algae) and CO2 removal
   (1.32 ton CO2/ton algae) while Scenario 2 surpassed the other three
   scenarios in terms of net cost. Scenario 1 produced the lowest energy
   while Scenario 3 was the most expensive bioenergy system. This study
   evaluated critical parameters that could direct the proper design of the
   microalgae bioenergy system with an efficient energy production, CO2
   removal, and economic feasibility.

AB In situ transesterification of wet microalgae is a promising, simplified
   alternative biodiesel production process that replaces multiple
   operations of cell drying, extraction, and transesterification reaction.
   This study addresses enhanced biodiesel production from Nannochloropsis
   gaditana at elevated temperatures. Compared with the previously reported
   in situ transesterification process of conducting the reaction at a
   temperature ranging from 95 to 125°C, the present work employs higher
   temperatures of at least 150°C. This relatively harsh condition allows
   much less acid catalyst with or without co-solvent to be used during
   this single extraction-conversion process. Without any co-solvent, 0.58%
   (v/v) of H2SO4in the reaction medium can achieve 90 wt% of the total
   lipid conversion to biodiesel at 170°C when the moisture content of wet
   algal paste is 80 wt%. Here, the effects of temperature, acid catalyst,
   and co-solvent on the FAEE yield and specification were scrutinized, and
   the reaction kinetic was investigated to understand the solvothermal in
   situ transesterification reaction at the high temperature. Having a
   biphasic system (water/chloroform) during the reaction also helped to
   meet biodiesel quality standard EN 14214, as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+cations
   and phosphorus were detected only below 5 ppm. With highlights on the
   economic feasibility, wet in situ transesterification at the high
   temperature can contribute to sustainable production of biodiesel from
   microalgae by reducing the chemical input and relieve the burden of
   extensive post purification process, therefore a step towards green
   process.

AB Economic viability of biodiesel production relies mainly on the
   productivity of biomass and microalgal lipids. In addition, production
   of &omega; fatty acids is favorable for human nutrition. Thus,
   enhancement of lipid accumulation with high proportion of omega fatty
   acids could help the dual use of microalgal lipids in human nutrition
   and biodiesel production through biorefinery. In that context,
   phytohormones have been identified as a promising factor to increase
   biomass and lipids production. However, nitrogen limitation has been
   discussed as a potential tool for lipid accumulation in microalgae,
   which results in simultaneous growth retardation. The present study aims
   to investigate the combined effect of N-depletion and 3-Indoleacetic
   acid (IAA) supplementation on lipid accumulation of the marine
   eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis oceanica as one of the promising
   microalgae for omega fatty acids production. The study confirmed that
   N-starvation stimulates the lipid content ofN. oceanica. IAA enhanced
   both growth and lipid accumulation due to enhancement of pigments
   biosynthesis. Therefore, combination effect of IAA and nitrogen
   depletion showed gradual increase in the dry weight compared to the
   control. Lipid analysis showed lower quantity of saturated fatty acids
   (SFA, 26.25%) than the sum of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (PUFA). Under N-depletion, SFA decreased by 12.98% compared
   to the control, which recorded much reduction by increasing of IAA
   concentration. Reduction of SFA was in favor of PUFA, mainly omega-6 and
   omega-3 fatty acids which increased significantly due to IAA combined
   with N-depletion. Thus, the present study suggests a biorefinery
   approach for lipids extracted fromN. oceanicafor dual application in
   nutrition followed by biodiesel production.

   In this regard, the present study evaluated the potential of utilizing
   microalgaH. pluvialisto produce biodiesel without being constricted to

   limitation was investigated on the growth parameters, photosynthetic
   pigments, astaxanthin, and biochemical composition as well as the fatty
   acid (FA) profile ofH. pluvialis. Finally, the physical/chemical
   features of biodiesel produced fromH. pluvialiswere assessed. Nitrogen
   deprivation (0 mg /L) decreased the cell number (/mL), biomass (g/ L),
   cell size, growth rate (), and biomass productivity (g/ L/ d) ofH.
   pluvialisduring 40 days of the experiment. Additionally, a remarkable
   reduction was found in chlorophyll content (pg/cell) under nitrogen
   deprivation over the culture period, whilst astaxanthin (g/cell) was
   found to be four times higher on the 40th day. Following treatment for
   40 days, the carbohydrate and protein contents of the control culture
   (nitrogen-rich culture) were highest, while the lipid content ofH.
   pluvialisdid not change significantly under nitrogen stress. Besides,
   saturated fatty acids (SFAs) accounted for 75% of the total FAs under
   nitrogen starvation. Hence, the high SFAs level and the lowest level of
   C18 FAs determined the suitability ofH. pluvialisgrown in nitrogen-free
   culture for the production of biodiesel. Accordingly, cellular stresses,
   such as nitrogen limitation, increase the production of astaxanthin inH.

AB Algae are without doubt the most productive photosynthetic organisms on
   Earth; they are highly efficient in converting CO2 and nutrients into
   biomass. These abilities can be exploited by culturing microalgae from
   wastewater and flue gases for effective wastewater reclamation. Algae
   are known to remove nitrogen and phosphorus as well as several organic
   contaminants including pharmaceuticals from wastewater. Biomass
   production can even be enhanced by the addition of CO2 originating from
   flue gases. The algal biomass can then be used as a raw material to
   produce bioenergy; depending on its composition, various types of
   biofuels such as biodiesel, biogas, bioethanol, biobutanol or
   biohydrogen can be obtained. However, algal biomass generated in
   wastewater and flue gases also contains contaminants which, if not
   degraded, will end up in the ashes. In this review, the current
   knowledge on algal biomass production in wastewater and flue gases is
   summarized; special focus is given to the algal capacity to remove
   contaminants from wastewater and flue gases, and the consequences when
   converting this biomass into different types of biofuels.

AB Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions have increased research efforts
   into alternatives in bio-based processes. With regard to transport fuel,
   bioethanol and biodiesel are still the main biofuels used. It is
   expected that future production of these biofuels will be based on
   processes using either non-food competing biomasses, or characterised by
   low CO2 emissions. Many microorganisms, such as microalgae, yeast,
   bacteria and fungi, have the ability to accumulate oils under special
   culture conditions. Microbial oils might become one of the potential
   feed-stocks for biodiesel production in the near future. The use of
   these oils is currently under extensive research in order to reduce
   production costs associated with the fermentation process, which is a
   crucial factor to increase economic feasibility. An important way to
   reduce processing costs is the use of wastes as carbon sources. The aim
   of the present review is to describe the main aspects related to the use
   of different oleaginous microorganisms for lipid production and their
   performance when using bio-wastes. The possibilities for combining
   hydrogen (H2) and lipid production are also explored in an attempt for
   improving the economic feasibility of the process.

AB The global shift towards sustainable energy and bioproducts has
   intensified research on algae. Renewable green biofuel can address and
   provide solutions to both energy crisis and climate change
   challenges.Botryococcus braunii, a bloom forming green microalga, known
   for its high lipid content and potential for biofuel production has been
   explored in the present study. The study envisages the utilisation of
   algal blooms in freshwater ecosystems for the production of biodiesel
   and high value bioproducts through an integrated biorefinery approach.
   During the peak bloom, the algal cell densities reached up to 3.3 *
   106colonies L-1with significant shift in water quality due to high
   nutrient uptake. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic analysis revealed
   high concentration of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids,
   particularly hexadecanoic acid (C16:0) and 9-octadecenoic acid (C18:1)
   which are essential for stable, energy-rich biodiesel production.
   Hydrocarbons including squalene, botryococcenes, and botryococcane,
   produced by this alga have significant industrial applications. The high
   polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) content in the alga emphasises its potential
   for sustainable bioplastic production. Growth conditions, lipid content,
   and biochemical composition ofB. brauniiwere investigated. Algal blooms
   can provide a sustainable and economically viable source of biofuel with
   high value co-products. This approach not only contributes to renewable
   energy solutions through valorising a waste bioresource but in
   combination with other mass cultivation strategies can also offer a
   means to sustainably manage the impact of algal blooms on aquatic
   ecosystems.

AB Using available data, we analysed the biofuel production via pyrolysis

   or at mass ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1. The life cycle assessment (LCA),
   global warming potential (GWP), energy recovery, and economic
   feasibility were compared. GWP was 36-44% lower for the co-pyrolysis
   scenarios than for SS alone. For energy recovery from pyrolysis gases, a
   gas turbine was more effective than gas heating, compensating for up to
   28% of the pyrolysis energy requirement for all five scenarios. The
   drying process accounted for 69-88% of the total energy consumption,
   indicating that the dewatering process should be improved to maximise
   sustainability and profitability. All scenarios were profitable; the 1:1
   mixture gave the highest net profit (9% more than that of SS). To
   conclude, co-pyrolysis of SS and microalgae is environmentally and
   financially viable for biowaste management in municipal wastewater
   treatment plants.

AB Biodiesel is becoming an increasingly attractive fuel due to its
   environmental benefits and the fact that it is made of renewable
   resources. Microalgae are a promising alternative source of oil for
   biodiesel production. In the study, the effects of temperature (25 to
   45°C), nitrogen concentration (0.25-1.5 g.L-1), and pH (5 to 8) on cell
   growth, lipid accumulation, pigment content, photosynthesis rate, and
   antioxidant enzymes activities of Scenedesmus sp. were determined. The
   results indicated that antioxidant enzyme activities increased
   significantly in comparison to the control at 40 to 45°C. A significant
   increase in chlorophyll concentration was found at low pH, nitrate
   concentration, and temperature. The highest microalgae lipid content
   (84.86%) was obtained at 30 to 35°C, pH 5 to 6 and NO3- of 0.875 g.L-1
   according to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) results. On
   the other hand, the highest yield of fatty acids was achieved at the
   lowest nitrate concentration, pH 5.5 and 32°C. In a lipid analysis it
   was found that palmitic (C16:0) and oleic (C18:1) acids dominantly
   constituted the algal fatty acids and a much higher content of natural
   lipid. Lipid production is an important indicator assessing microalga
   species for biodiesel production. The Chlorophyta, particularly
   Chlorella vulgaris Beyerinck and Scenedesmus, had the highest growth
   rates and showed the greatest increase in lipid content in response to
   nitrogen limitation. Thus Scenedesmus sp. biomass could be used as
   suitable feedstock for biodiesel production.

AB This study evaluated the production of biodiesel from the
   microalgaeChlorella pyrenoidosaby direct transesterification using
   2-methyltetrahydrofuran or cyclopentyl methyl ether co-solvents as an
   alternative to chloroform. Acid-catalyzed transesterification using
   hydrochloric acid was developed for biodiesel production. Biodiesel was
   purified by column chromatography using one of the two green solvents as
   eluents. The highly ecological biodiesel quality was compared to the
   biodiesel produced using chloroform as co-solvent. A 33factorial design
   was conducted to optimize the production of fatty acid methyl esters,
   being the independent variables investigated: solvent and catalyst
   volume, solvent and catalyst ratio (methanol:co-solvent:hydrochloric
   acid), and temperature, with a reaction time of 150 min. Biodiesel
   production was mainly influenced by temperature increase. The achieved
   yields using cyclopentyl methyl ether, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and
   chloroform were 71-92%, 67-91%, and 61-76%, respectively. The fatty acid
   methyl esters profile of biodiesel produced with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran
   and cyclopentyl methyl ether consisted of approximately 45%
   polyunsaturated components. The biodiesel obtained was within the ASTM
   D6751 and EN 14214 standards. The replacement of fossil solvents used in
   direct transesterification of biomass with a green solvent resulted in a
   further ecological biodiesel production process towards a circular
   bioeconomy.

AB The recent growing interest in sustainable and alternative sources of
   energy and bio-based products has driven the paradigm shift to an
   integrated model termed "biorefinery." Biorefinery framework implements
   the concepts of novel eco-technologies and eco-efficient processes for
   the sustainable production of energy and value-added biomolecules. The
   utilization of microbial resources for the production of various
   value-added products has been documented in the literatures. However,
   the appointment of these microbial resources in integrated resource
   management requires a better understanding of their status. The main of
   aim of this review is to provide an overview on the defined positioning
   and overall contribution of the microbial resources, i.e., algae, fungi
   and bacteria, for various bioprocesses and generation of multiple
   products from a single biorefinery. By utilizing waste material as a
   feedstock, biofuels can be generated by microalgae while sequestering
   environmental carbon and producing value added compounds as by-products.
   In parallel, fungal biorefineries are prolific producers of
   lignocellulose degrading enzymes along with pharmaceutically important
   novel products. Conversely, bacterial biorefineries emerge as a
   preferred platform for the transformation of standard cells into
   proficient bio-factories, developing chassis and turbo cells for
   enhanced target compound production. This comprehensive review is poised
   to offer an intricate exploration of the current trends, obstacles, and
   prospective pathways of microbial biorefineries, for the development of
   future biorefineries.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) using biological process is one of the promising
   approaches for CO2 capture and storage. Recently, biological
   sequestration using microalgae has gained many interest due to its
   capability to utilize CO2 as carbon source and biomass produced can be
   used as a feedstock for other value added product for instance biofuel
   and chemicals. In this study, the CO2 biofixation by two microalgae
   species, Chlorella sp. and Tetraselmis suecica was investigated using
   different elevated CO2 concentration. The effect of CO2 concentration on
   microalgae growth kinetic, biofixation and its chemical composition were
   determined using 0.04, 5, 15 and 30% CO2. The variation of initial pH
   value and its relationship on CO2 concentration toward cultivation
   medium was also investigated. The present study indicated that both
   microalgae displayed different tolerance toward CO2 concentration. The
   maximum biomass production and biofixation for Chlorella sp. of 0.64 g
   L-1 and 96.89 mg L-1 d-1 was obtained when the cultivation was carried
   out using 5 and 15% CO2, respectively. In contrast, the maximum biomass
   production and CO2 biofixation for T. suecica of 0.72 g L-1 and 111.26
   mg L-1 d-1 were obtained from cultivation using 15 and 5% CO2. The pH
   value for the cultivation medium using CO2 was between 7.5 and 9, which
   is favorable for microalgal growth. The potential of biomass obtained
   from the cultivation as a biorefinery feedstock was also evaluated. An
   anaerobic fermentation of the microalgae biomass by bacteria Clostridium
   saccharoperbutylacenaticum N1-4 produced various type of value added
   product such as organic acid and solvent. Approximately 0.27 and 0.90 g
   L-1 of organic acid, which corresponding to acetic and butyric acid were
   produced from the fermentation of Chlorella sp. and T. suecica biomass.
   Overall, this study suggests that Chlorella sp. and T. suecica are
   efficient microorganism that can be used for CO2 biofixation and as a
   feedstock for chemical production.

U1 0

AB The economic feasibility and technological improvement to produce
   biodiesel from microalga, Chlorella vulgaris is investigated. The
   biodiesel would help Malaysia replace diesel with renewable and
   sustainable energy in the transportation sector. Accordingly, the
   Malaysian Agriculture and Plantation Greenhouse Gas Model is modified
   and extended to incorporate algal farms. The model forecasts Malaysia's
   market prices and quantities of major agricultural commodities between
   2024 and 2064. The state of the art is a commercial algal biodiesel
   industry is incorporated into a price endogenous model of Malaysia's
   agriculture, and algal farms can experience technological improvement.
   The simulation results indicate that algal biodiesel is not economically
   feasible. The biodiesel price must be RM2.80 per litre or higher for the
   algal farms to produce biodiesel. The biodiesel price could be lowered
   to RM0.60 per litre if the algal farms experience a one-percent annual
   boost in either algal harvest yield or productivity gain. The results
   indicate that harvest yield improvements boost biodiesel production more
   than productivity improvements. The feasibility depends on algal farms
   to process the leftover slurry and supply the domestic animal feed
   markets. At last, the biodiesel offsets CO2 transportation sector
   emissions while the alga recycles the CO2 from fossil fuel electric
   power plants, which help Malaysia sequester high levels of CO2.

AB It is expected that 84% of the global energy demands will be met through
   fossil fuels in 2030 due to increasing energy needs. However, due to
   their impact on the environment through the emission of anthropogenic
   green house gases, biofuels were introduced as alternative sources of
   energy. Biofuels of plant origin for the transport sector proved to be
   controversial due to competition for food production, fertile land and
   expensive production processes. As a secondary alternative, microalgae
   such asScenedesmus obliquus,Chlorella vulgarisandNannochloropsissp. were
   found to be suitable candidates for liquid biofuels production. This
   review describes the production of transportation liquid biofuels from
   plant biomass and microalgae. Information is provided on how the
   controversies related to plant biomass lead to the use of algal biomass.
   The production processes involved in both generations are discussed and
   highlighted. Furthermore, details on the production of secondary
   products such as pigments, feed additives and valuable secondary
   metabolites are also provided.

AB Two individual chains of microalgae-to-diesel and microalgae-to-butanol
   were upgraded through process integration and design. According to life
   cycle assessment (LCA) standards, the two proposed chains were compared
   in terms of 17 categories of LCA impacts and the sensitivity analysis of
   LCA impacts on two chains with different lipid or carbohydrate content
   of microalgae cells was performed. Based on the prescribed
   specifications and conditions for microalgae cultivation, pretreatment
   and purity level of the products, LCA analysis revealed that the annual
   ReCiPe end point score of producing 1 kg biobutanol is lower than that
   of 1 kg biodiesel by 54.4%. The upgraded microalgae-to-butanol chain
   could reduce the annual ReCiPe end point score of producing 100 MJ
   diesel/gasoline from crude oil by 5-10%. The microalgae-to-butanol chain
   is more ecofriendly than the microalgae-to-diesel chain due to lower LCA

AB Microalgae are a potential source of numerous nutritional products and
   biofuels. Their applications range from the food industry to the medical
   and fuel sectors and beyond. Recently, the conversion of biomass into
   biodiesel and other biofuels has received a lot of positive attention
   within the fossil fuel arena. The objective of biorefineries is to focus
   on utilising biomass efficiently to produce quality biofuel products by
   minimising the input as well as to reduce the use of chemical or thermal
   pre-treatments. Pre-treatment processes in biorefineries involve cell
   disruption to obtain lipids. Cell disruption is a crucial part of
   bioconversion, as the structure and nature of microalgae cell walls are
   complex. In recent years, many research papers have shown various
   pre-treatment methods and their advantages. The objective of this paper
   was to provide a comprehensive in-depth review of various recent
   pre-treatment techniques that have been used for microalgal biodiesel
   production and to discuss their advantages, disadvantages, and how they
   are applied in algal biorefineries.

AB Open raceway ponds are regarded as the most economically viable option
   for large-scale cultivation of microalgae for low to mid-value
   bio-products, such as biodiesel. However, improvements are required
   including reducing the costs associated with harvesting biomass. There
   is now a growing interest in exploiting natural ecological processes
   within biotechnology. We review how chemical cues produced by algal
   grazers induce colony formation in algal cells, which subsequently leads
   to their sedimentation. A statistical meta-analysis of more than 80
   studies reveals thatDaphniagrazers can induce high levels of colony
   formation and sedimentation inScenedesmus obliquusand that these
   natural, infochemical induced sedimentation rates are comparable to
   using commercial chemical equivalents. These data suggest that natural
   ecological interactions can be co-opted in biotechnology as part of a
   promising, low energy and clean harvesting method for use in large
   raceway systems.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an important industrial process,
   particularly in a biorefinery approach. The liquid effluent and carbon
   dioxide in the off-gas, can be used to produce high-value products
   through the cultivation of cyanobacteria. Growth on AD effluent is often
   limited due to substrate limitation or inhibitory compounds. This study
   demonstrates the successful cultivation ofSynechococcuson minimally
   amended AD effluent, supplemented with MgSO4and diluted with seawater.
   An 8 L airlift reactor illustrated growth in a pilot scale setup. Higher
   biomass yields were observed for cyanobacteria grown in diluted AD
   effluent compared to minimal medium, with 60% total nitrogen removal in
   the effluent. It was demonstrated that controlling the pH, increasing
   dissolved salt concentrations and adding MgSO4to the effluent allowed
   for the successful cultivation of the cyanobacterium, circumventing the
   addition of clean water for effluent dilution. This could ultimately
   increase the feasibility of anaerobic digestion-microalgae integrated
   biorefineries.

TI Integration of microalgae-based wastewater bioremediation-biorefinery
   process to promote circular bioeconomy and sustainability: a review.

VL 51
IS 3
PY 2022
U1 9
U2 40
AB Bioremediation of wastewater using microalgae is inexpensive, energy
   efficient, and effective in pollutant reduction as compared to
   conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Wastewater is a huge
   resource of minerals, nutrients, bioenergy, and valuable organic
   compounds and can be used for cultivation of microalgae. The microalgal
   biomass can be further used as biorefinery feedstock to produce biofuels
   and commercially important high-value products. The potential of
   microalgae toward bioremediation and biorefinery applications presents
   the avenues for integrating the two processes to support circular
   bioeconomy and sustainability. This review presents a holistic view of
   integration of bioremediation and biorefinery processes using microalgae
   for deriving multiple benefits like pollutant removal, resource
   recovery, biofuel production, and generation of high-value commercial
   products. The current status of high-throughput microalgal screening
   technologies is also discussed since the selection of suitable
   microalgal strains is crucial for the application. The review further
   summarizes various processes involved in bioremediation and biorefinery
   systems such as cultivation, bioremediation, harvesting, and downstream
   processing. Recent trends in microalgal strain improvement for
   bioremediation and biorefinery applications through genetic engineering,
   bioinformatics, omics technologies, and genome editing tools are
   highlighted, while addressing the risks, biosafety issues, and
   regulatory affairs associated with genetically modified algae.

AB A freshwater Chlorella sp. was cultured at temperatures from 10 to 45°C
   and synergistic stress was employed by using selective and complete
   nutrient depleted growth media. Temperature fluctuations were found to
   have a significant effect on the microalgae physiology. The optimum
   temperature of 35°C shows suitability for growth in a sub-tropical
   climate. The fatty acid methyl esters' (FAMEs') composition was
   significantly altered when cultures were incubated under various
   pre-determined stress conditions. The effect of dual stress was found to
   have the greatest increase in the lipid yield, averaging 55% (w/w). The
   majority of the identified FAMEs (C16 and C18) showed the potential for
   quality biodiesel and aviation fuel due to the characteristics of FAME.
   This study is relevant for commercial-scale biodiesel production and the
   technologies developed would improve the economic feasibility and
   potential of microalgal biomass feedstock for biodiesel production by
   transesterification. There is also high potential for low-carbon jet
   fuel by thermal cracking or pyrolysis and fractionation of crude-bio-oil
   from Chlorella sp. These processes will convert carbon chains or FAMES
   in the C14 to C16 range, which is appropriate for low-carbon jet fuel.
   It is therefore possible to generate biodiesel and aviation fuel from
   Chlorella sp. cultivated in freshwater at achievable temperatures in a
   sub-tropical environment under total nutrient deprivation, aiming to
   stimulate a bio-oil increase.

AB Commercial production of microalgae biofuel is not economically feasible
   since it cannot compete with the price of fossil fuels. Algal biofuel
   could be cost-effective if high-value co-products are produced from
   microalgal biomass before it is converted into biofuel. Thus, this
   research aims to demonstrate a circular biorefinery process of producing
   bio-crude bio-oil as well as high-value products like carotenoids from a
   marine microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica. The microalga was cultivated
   in raceway ponds over the years with the highest biomass productivity of
   30-40 g m-2 day-1 recorded in October and November of 2021, but it
   reduced in extremely high summer temperatures and low temperatures in
   winter of Delhi NCR, India. The annual average biomass productivity of
   19.13 g m-2 day-1 was recorded, which is equivalent to 69825 kg ha-1
   year-1. The algal biomass was processed for high-value carotenoids using
   a green process, i.e. supercritical carbon dioxide extraction.
   Carotenoid yield of 252 mug/g of biomass was obtained after optimizing
   temperature and pressure in the supercritical extraction process. The
   spent biomass after carotenoid extraction was used to produce bio-crude
   bio-oil using hydrothermal liquefaction. There was no significant
   difference between bio-crude oil yield and properties after carotenoid
   extraction and direct biomass use. A bioeconomic methodology for closing
   the circular loop involving recycling the effluent generated during
   hydrothermal liquefaction to re-cultivate the microalgae is
   demonstrated. This study highlights the potential of green technology,
   circular bioeconomy, and biorefinery practices in developing sustainable
   and environmentally friendly solutions for the chemical and energy
   sectors.

AB Although the production of biofuels from microalgae has numerous
   advantages over other raw materials, its large-scale application still
   comes across economic aspects. In this context, the concept of
   biorefinery emerges as a strategy to increase the sustainability of this
   process. Studies have been developed to reduce production costs,
   especially to optimize the harvesting stage. Among the techniques used,
   bioflocculation is a promising alternative to traditional harvesting
   methods, as it is viable in terms of cost, execution and efficiency and,
   above all, it is a more environmentally appropriate method. This study
   aimed to perform a bibliometric and systematic review of traditional
   algal harvesting techniques and the mechanisms governing the different
   interactions of microorganisms used as bioflocculants, especially fungi.
   The high efficiencies of microalgae harvesting, combined with the
   possibility of cultivation in wastewater and the various bioproducts
   originated from this biomass, show the potential application of
   bioflocculation in the context of integrated biorefineries.

AB Although fossil fuels remain the main source of energy, the volume of
   renewable sources of energy is constantly increasing. Biodiesel is a
   promising alternative fuel due to the number of advantages compared to
   fossil fuel and other types of biofuel. The specific objective of this
   study was to identify the difference between conventional and novel
   technologies applied during the whole life cycle of biodiesel production
   and consumption. The study offers some important insights into the
   recent advances in the biodiesel industry including biodiesel production
   from microalgal lipids, advanced homogenous and enzymatic
   transesterification, non-catalytic supercritical transesterification,
   application of microwave and ultrasound assisting technologies.
   Considering all the factors affecting the efficiency and safety of the
   biodiesel production process, here we reviewed the main principals and
   recent achievements in the environmental life cycle assessment of
   biodiesel production and consumption.

AB Anthropogenic emissions of CO2 have reached a critical level and the
   global surface temperature is expected to rise by 1.5°C between 2030 and
   2050. To ameliorate the current global warming scenario, the research
   community has been struggling to find more economical and innovative
   solutions for carbon sequestration. Among such techniques, the use of
   microalgal species such as Chlorella sp., Dunaliellatertiolecta,
   Spirulina platensis, Desmodesmus sp., and Nannochloropsis sp., among
   others have shown high carbon tolerance capacity (10-100%) for
   establishing carbon capture, utilization and storage systems. To make
   microalgal-based carbon capture more economical, the microalgal biomass
   (-2 g/L) can be converted biofuels, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals
   through biorefinery approach with product yield in the range of
   60-99.5%. Further, CRISPR-Cas9 has enabled the knockout of specific
   genes in microalgal species that can be used to generate low pH tolerant
   strains with high lipid production. Inspite of the emerging developments
   in pollution control by microalgae, only limited investigations are
   available on its economic aspects which indicate a production cost of -$
   0.5-15/kg microalgal biomass. This review intends to summarize the
   advancements in different carbon sequestration techniques while
   highlighting their mechanisms and major research areas that need
   attention for economical microalgae-based carbon sequestration.

AB Perceiving and detecting a sustainable source of energy is very critical
   issue for current modern society. Hydrogen on combustion releases energy
   and water as a byproduct and has been considered as an environmental
   pollution free energy carrier. From the last decade, most of the
   researchers have recommended hydrogen as one of the cleanest fuels and
   its demand is rising ever since. Hydrogen having the highest energy
   density is more advantageous than any other fuel. Hydrogen obtained from
   the fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct and creates
   environment negative effect. Therefore, biohydrogen production from
   green algae and cyanobacteria is an attractive option that generates a
   benign renewable energy carrier. Microalgal feedstocks show a high
   potential for the generation of fuel such as biohydrogen, bioethanol and
   biodiesel. This article has reviewed the different methods of
   biohydrogen production while also trying to find out the most economical
   and ecofriendly method for its production. A thorough review process has
   been carried out to study the methods, enzymes involved, factors
   affecting the rate of hydrogen production, dual nature of algae,
   challenges and commercialization potential of algal biohydrogen.

AB Energy-storage metabolites such as neutral lipids and carbohydrates are
   valuable compounds for liquid biofuel production. The aim of this work
   is to elucidate the main biological responses of two algae species known
   for their effective energy-rich compound accumulation in nitrogen
   limitation and day-night cycles:Nannochloropsis gaditana, a seawater
   species, andParachlorella kessleri, a freshwater species. Lipid and
   carbohydrate production are investigated, as well as cell resistance to
   mechanical disruption for energy-rich compound release.
   Nitrogen-depletedN. gaditanashowed only a low consumption of
   energy-storage molecules with a non-significant preference for neutral
   lipids (TAG) and carbohydrates in day-night cycles. However, it did
   accumulate significantly fewer carbohydrates thanP. kessleri. Following
   this, the highest levels of productivity for N. gaditana in chemostat
   cultures at four levels of nitrogen limitation were found to be 3.4 and
   2.2 * kg/m2.d for carbohydrates and TAG, respectively, at 56%
   limitation. The cell disruption rate of N. gaditana decreased along with
   nitrogen limitation, from 75% (at 200%) to 17% (at 13%). In the context
   of potentially recoverable energy for biofuels,P. kesslerishowed good
   potential for biodiesel and high potential for bioethanol; by
   contrast,N. gaditanawas found to be more efficient for biodiesel
   production only.

AB Microalgae (green or blue-green ones) are among the most important
   organisms on the world, with a versatile and adaptive metabolism. They
   are able to synthesize bioactive molecules (mainly secondary metabolites
   such as unsaturated fatty acids, pigments, amino acids) with biomedical
   applications, enhancement of the nutritional value of food, animal
   feed/aquaculture, as well with impact on the environmental protection
   (as raw materials for biofuels). Last decade, by a targeted selection of
   wild microalgae strains, their cultivation in farms developed in
   parallel with the bioreactors'products. There are nowadays cultivated at
   industrial scale especiallyDunaliella salina p.,Spirulina
   platensis,Hematococcus pluvialisorChlorella vulgarisas valuable
   resources of polyunsaturated lipids and sterols, proteins,
   polysaccharides, carotenoid pigments, vitamins, minerals with
   antioxidant, antibacterial or antiviral effects. This review presents a
   systematic approach on the recent literature data collected the last
   years, underlying their morphologic and biochemical potential, the
   advanced technologies to use the bioactive components of different
   microalgae, new formulations which incorporate, stabilize and store
   their bioactivity and increase the bioavailability of their components
   in food and feed. Although their morphologic and biochemical potential
   is well described, there are presented new data on their bioactive
   components and formulations using emerging technologies for new
   application approaches which aims their use as ingredients in added
   value products for food, cosmetics and feed industry, to be exploited
   for commercial use. This review updated the last findings in these
   areas, underlined the reason for the scientific and technological
   advances, due to their huge potential, not only in environment, energy,
   but more and more as ingredients for food and feed/aquaculture products,
   in the future.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions have several adverse environmental effects,
   like pollution and climate change. Currently applied carbon capture and
   storage (CCS) methods are not cost effective and have not been proven
   safe for long term sequestration. Another attractive approach is CO2
   valorization, whereby CO2 can be captured in the form of biomass via
   photosynthesis and is subsequently converted into various form of
   bioenergy. This article summarizes the current carbon sequestration and
   utilization technologies, while emphasizing the value of bioconversion
   of CO2. In particular, CO2 sequestration by terrestrial plants,
   microalgae and other microorganisms are discussed. Prospects and
   challenges for CO2 conversion are addressed. The aim of this review is
   to provide comprehensive knowledge and updated information on the
   current advances in biological CO2 sequestration and valorization, which
   are essential if this approach is to achieve environmental
   sustainability and economic feasibility.

AB The ability of microalgae to sequester carbon and at the same time
   synthesise valuable compounds with potential applications in
   nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries makes them
   attractive for commercial deployment, especially in view of a blue
   bioeconomy. Among microalgae, the diatomPhaeodactylum tricornutumis
   considered as an important potential source of omega-3 polyunsaturated
   fatty acids, such as eicosapentanoic acid, an essential polyunsaturated
   fatty acid with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The aim
   of this study was to perform the Life Cycle Assessment of the
   cultivation ofP. tricornutum- at semi-industrial scale in
   photobioreactor - for the production of high-quality bioactive compounds
   comparing synthetic carbon dioxide supply to a supply with waste carbon
   dioxide from a biogas upgrading process hypothesizing industrial
   symbiosis network. The effect of renewable energy use instead of the
   European electricity mix was also examined. Primary data on the
   production process, including the stages of cleaning and sterilisation,
   cultivation, harvesting and freeze-drying, were used. The midpoint
   impact categories recommended in the ILCD Handbook were used for
   performing the impact assessment. A sensitivity analysis was also
   performed on algal productivity, culture medium recirculation factor and
   amount of solvents per cleaning cycle. Firstly, results indicate in
   general cultivation and freeze-drying as the most contributing stages to
   the impacts. Secondly, they demonstrate in the comparative assessment
   that the use of carbon dioxide from the biogas upgrading is a feasible
   and attractive alternative to the synthetic one, as it allows for the
   improvement of the environmental performance of the production process
   in all the analysed impact categories. Finally, sensitivity analysis
   suggests that the environmental performance could be further improved by
   acting on other key factors, such as electricity source, nutrients
   culture medium and cleaning solutions.

AB Microalgae biomass has attracted great interest from researchers as a
   promising feedstock for biodiesel production. Although enormous research
   works have been carried out to identify microalgae species with high
   biomass and lipid productivities, genetic modification of strains as
   well as optimization of cultivation conditions, however, the progress is
   yet to be fully satisfied. Based on the present lipid yield and
   extraction methods, it is still not feasible to commercialize the
   microalgae biodiesel. One of the promising approaches to elevate lipid
   accumulation by microalgae is through tuning the cellular mechanisms and
   metabolic pathway by exposing microalgae cells to various abiotic stress
   environments such as nutrient starvation, high salinity level and strong
   light intensity. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis of quantitative
   influences of critical abiotic stress on both microalgae biomass and
   lipid profile is still limited in the literature. Hence, the present
   paper aims to deliver insights into selections of single and multiple
   abiotic stress factors for simultaneous enhancement of microalgae
   biomass and lipids (polar and non-polar) which could improve the
   techno-economic viability in the microalgae processing chains and
   biorefinery industries.

AB Energy is one of the prime needs of the modern world, and energy demands
   have been rapidly increasing in the recent years owing to rapid
   advancements in industrialization and population explosion. Conventional
   fossil fuels are being depleted at rapid rates, and the use of
   conventional sources such as coal or nuclear sources cause several
   hazards to the environment. New sources of fuel, such as bioenergy, are
   an ideal option for fulfilling ever-increasing energy demands. This book
   offers an exploration of these alternate fuel sources, including
   biohydrogen, microbial fuel cells, bioethanol, and biodiesel production,
   focusing on the challenges and factors hindering the real-time
   application of these bioenergy sources. Researchers all over the world
   are working in this energy sector, and this has led to drastic
   improvements in bioenergy research. However, the technology gap between
   research and industrial application still exists. Further, this book
   offers engineers and technologists from different disciplines valuable
   information on this multifaceted field. The field of bioenergy is
   interdisciplinary, requiring the knowledge of biologists, chemists,
   physicists, and engineers. Exploring the current trends and future
   prospects for biofuels, the information presented in this book will be
   valuable to the international industrial community for identifying new
   options to circumvent problems that exist in bioenergy applications.
   Topics include: thermophilic biohydrogen production; bio-hydrogen
   production; microbial fuel cells as a promising alternative energy
   source; microbial fuel cell applications; potential of Oscillatoria
   annae in producing bioethanol; potential of lignocellulosic biofuels;
   biodiesel production; reactor designs for biodesel production; long-term
   storage stability of Pongamia pinnata and Jatropha curcus biodiesel.

U2 12
AB Malaysia fosters its economic growth with fossil fuels, which are not
   sustainable and raise atmospheric carbon dioxide. This study aims to
   assess the economic feasibility and sustainability of Chlorella vulgaris
   to create bioethanol for the transportation sector. A partial
   equilibrium model of the Malaysian agricultural markets is modified to
   include algal farms. The model forecasts agricultural prices,
   quantities, employment, fertiliser usage, and greenhouse gas emissions.
   The results suggest the algal farms produce 47.38 million litres of
   bioethanol in 2024 and peak at 163.67 million litres in 2044 for $0.65
   per litre. This bioethanol offsets 0.11 million metric tons of carbon
   dioxide equivalent emissions from the transportation sector in 2024,
   which grows to 0.37 million tons in 2044. The microalga consumes the
   flue gas of coal and natural gas electric power plants - 0.31 million
   metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2024 and 1.09 million tons in 2044. The
   algal farms also sell dried slurry to the animal feed markets, which
   offsets the algal farm's high costs. The algal farms slightly raise
   Malaysia's agricultural commodity and fertiliser prices while boosting
   agricultural employment. The Malaysian government should subsidise algal
   bioethanol at $0.12 per litre.

AB Microalgae have higher productivity of biomass than the conventional
   crops of fuel and are therefore, considered a potential biofuel source.
   Lipid, an important precursor of biodiesel, can be overproduced in
   microalgae by nitrogen deprivation. During nitrogen deficiency, radicals
   are overproduced, and the antioxidant levels are insufficient to
   counteract the radicals. Thus, the increase in cellular oxidative stress
   level, consequently acts as a stimulus for lipid accumulation. Lipid
   accumulation requires an excess of acetyl CoA and NADPH that is made
   possible by the following mechanism. Glycolysis upregulation
   overproduces pyruvate, which could be further transformed into acetyl
   CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; while the upregulation of the
   oxidative pentose phosphate cycle generates a high amount of NADPH. In
   addition to lipid overproduction, the lack of nitrogen often causes the
   accumulation of carbohydrates in selected species of microalgae, which
   could be used to generate biogas and bioethanol from the defatted
   biomass. By providing details on the differential regulation of the
   biochemical pathways leading to lipid and carbohydrate accumulation in
   nitrogen starved microalgae, the review opens up new possibilities in
   the microalgal biofuel production.

AB The search for renewable energy sources is one of today's most pressing
   challenges, and biofuels have emerged as a viable solution to meet
   demand and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Brazil presents the
   necessary conditions to stand out as a producer and exporter of biofuels
   worldwide, due to the country's great biodiversity and favorable
   climate. Among its biomass sources, microalgae stands out for presenting
   several advantages, such as high productivity and possibility of
   cultivation anywhere. This work aims to address the advantages and
   disadvantages of biofuel production from microalgae focused on the genus
   Botryococcus, known for the formation of liquid hydrocarbons and high
   lipid content. The species of the genus have great biotechnological
   potential, but are little studied, especially B. terribilis, which has
   diverse distribution and is generally found in alkaline reservoirs, not
   only in Brazil, but in other tropical climate regions.

AB Green microalgae are attractive to food, pharmaceutical, and biofuel
   industries due to the promising and diverse properties of their
   intracellular components. In current biotechnological applications,
   however, clear bottlenecks are the cell disruption and cell harvesting
   steps. Challenges in both of these processes are directly linked to the
   properties of the microalgal cell wall. The aim of this study was to
   explore the cell wall compositions and morphologies of four Nordic
   microalgal strains (Chlorella vulgaris(13-1),Scenedesmussp.
   (B2-2),Haematococcus pluvialis, andCoelastrellasp. (3-4)) and their
   changes in relation to logarithmic and stationary growth phases.
   Transmission electron microscopy imaging enabled us to visualize the
   cell walls and to observe structural elements such as spines,
   microfibrillar hairs, or layers. Using cryogenic X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, we quantified lipid, protein, and polysaccharide content
   of the outer surface of the microalgal cell wall in cultures. Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy highlighted changes between growth
   phases within the polysaccharide and protein fractions of the cell wall.
   Very prominent differences were observed in sugar and protein
   composition of theScenedesmussp. (B2-2) cell wall compared to the cell
   walls of the other three Nordic strains using trimethylsilyl
   derivatization.

AB Background: The microalgal-based industries are facing a number of
   important challenges that in turn affect their economic viability.
   Arguably the most important of these are associated with the high costs
   of harvesting and dewatering of the microalgal cells, the costs and
   sustainability of nutrient supplies and costly methods for large scale
   oil extraction. Existing harvesting technologies, which can account for
   up to 50% of the total cost, are not economically feasible because of
   either requiring too much energy or the addition of chemicals.
   Fungal-assisted flocculation is currently receiving increased attention
   because of its high harvesting efficiency. Moreover, some of fungal and
   microalgal strains are well known for their ability to treat wastewater,
   generating biomass which represents a renewable and sustainable
   feedstock for bioenergy production. Results: We screened 33 fungal
   strains, isolated from compost, straws and soil for their lipid content
   and flocculation efficiencies against representatives of microalgae
   commercially used for biodiesel production, namely the heterotrophic
   freshwater microalgaeChlorella protothecoidesand the marine
   microalgaeTetraselmis suecica. Lipid levels and composition were
   analyzed in fungal-algal pellets grown on media containing alternative
   carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sources from wheat straw and swine
   wastewater, respectively. The biomass of fungal-algal pellets grown on
   swine wastewater was used as feedstock for the production of value-added
   chemicals, biogas, bio-solids and liquid petrochemicals through
   pyrolysis. Co-cultivation of microalgae and filamentous fungus increased
   total biomass production, lipid yield and wastewater bioremediation
   efficiency. Conclusion: Fungal-assisted microalgal flocculation shows
   significant potential for solving the major challenges facing the
   commercialization of microalgal biotechnology, namely (i) the efficient
   and cost-effective harvesting of freshwater and seawater algal strains;
   (ii) enhancement of total oil production and optimization of its
   composition; (iii) nutrient supply through recovering of the primary
   nutrients, nitrogen and phosphates and microelements from wastewater.
   The biomass generated was thermochemically converted into biogas,
   bio-solids and a range of liquid petrochemicals including straight-chain
   C12 to C21 alkanes which can be directly used as a glycerine-free
   component of biodiesel. Pyrolysis represents an efficient alternative
   strategy for biofuel production from species with tough cell walls such
   as fungi and fungal-algal pellets.

AB ACOI 58 and ACOI 1257, two different Portuguese strains of colonial
   green microalga Botryococcus bruanii Kutz obtained from Coimbra
   Collection of Algae (ACOI), were evaluated on their potential for
   biofuel production, which was assessed from batch culture in
   photobioreactors under indoors and outdoors conditions using pretreated
   waste water and semisynthetic culture media. In the experiments, the
   maximum specific growth rate achieved was 0.4 day-1 with doubling times
   ranging from 2 to 7 days in the fastest growing phase. However, both
   strains showed ability to absorb nutrients in waste water cultures, to
   grow and accumulate oil. The maximum lipid extraction on a dry matter
   basis was 36% in CHU media and 29% in waste water cultures, which
   revealed the promising potential of these B. braunii isolates to be used
   in biofuel production applications. This is also supported by the
   predominance of oleic (C18:1, 42 to 63%) and palmitic acid (C16:0, 8 to
   18%) in the lipid extract, since the methyl esters of these fatty acids
   (FAME) are ideal for biodiesel production. In summary, although these
   strains of B. braunii have presented a typical growth for this species,
   they produced considerable lipid content and were able to grow in waste
   water and under outdoors conditions that warrants further investment in
   their study.

AB An alga belongs to the multi-pertinent group which can add to a
   significant sector of environment. They show a prevailing gathering of
   microorganisms for bioremediation due to their significant capacity to
   inactivate toxic heavy metals. It can easily absorb or neutralize the
   toxicity of heavy metals from water and soil through phytoremediation.
   Biosorption is a promising innovation that focuses on novel, modest, and
   exceptionally successful materials to apply in phytoremediation
   technology. Furthermore, algal biomass can be used for biofuel
   generation after phytoremediation using thermochemical or biological
   transformation processes. The algal components get affected by heavy
   metals during phytoremediation, but with the help of different
   techniques, these are yield efficient. The extreme lipid and mineral
   substances of microalgae have been proven helpful for biofuel
   manufacturing and worth extra products. Biofuels produced are bio-oil,
   biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, etc. The reuse capability of algae can be
   utilized toward ecological manageability and economic facility. In this
   review article, the reuse and recycling of algal biomass for biofuel
   production have been represented. This novel technique has numerous
   benefits and produces eco-friendly and economically beneficial products.
   Novelty statementThis article explains how algal biomass left over after
   phytoremediation can be reused and recycled to produce biofuel. It is a
   novel technique that is cost-effective, demands less time for biofuel
   production as it does not include cultivation and harvesting time, and
   produces products that are economically and environmentally beneficial
   for society.

   introduction of cellular morphologies and life cycle of H. pluvialis
   from green vegetative motile stage to red non-motile haematocyst stage.
   Subsequently, the conventional biorefinery methods (e.g., mechanical
   disruption, solvent extraction, direct extraction using vegetable oils,
   and enhanced solvent extraction) and recent advanced biorefinery
   techniques (e.g., supercritical CO2 extraction, magnetic-assisted
   extraction, ionic liquids extraction, and supramolecular solvent
   extraction) were presented and evaluated. Moreover, future prospect and
   challenges were highlighted to provide a useful guide for future
   development of biorefinery of astaxanthin from H. pluvialis. The review
   aims to serve as a present knowledge for researchers dealing with the

SO South African Journal of Science

PY 2021
U1 9
U2 83
AB One of the challenges of microalgae biotechnology is the cost of growth
   media nutrients, with microalgae consuming enormous quantities of
   fertilisers, more than other oil crops. The traditional use of synthetic
   fertilisers in mass cultivation of microalgae is associated with rising
   prices of crude oil and competition from traditional agriculture. The
   fact that fish farm wastewater (FFW) nutrients are released in the form
   preferred by microalgae (NH3for nitrogen and PO4-3for phosphate), and
   the ability of microalgae to use nitrogen from different sources, can be
   exploited by using fish farm effluent rich in nutrients (nitrogen and
   phosphorus) in the cultivation of cheaper microalgae biomass for
   production of biodiesel. The cultivation of algae biomass in FFW will
   also serve as wastewater treatment. We reviewed the benefits and
   potential of fish effluent in algae cultivation for the production of
   biodiesel. Microalgae can utilise nutrients in FFW for different
   applications desirable for the production of biomass, including the
   accumulation of lipids, and produce a fuel with desirable properties.
   Also, treating wastewater and reducing demand for fresh water are
   advantageous. The high lipid content and comparable biodiesel properties
   ofChlorella sorokinianaandScenedesmus obliquusmake both species viable
   for FFW cultivation for biodiesel production.

AB Rapidly exhausting fossil fuels combined with the ever-increasing demand
   for energy led to an ongoing search for alternative energy sources to
   meet the transportation, manufacturing, domestic and other energy
   demands of the grown population. Microalgae are at the forefront of
   alternative energy research due to their significant potential as a
   renewable feedstock for biofuels. However, microalgae platforms have not
   found a way into industrial-scale bioenergy production due to various
   technical and economic constraints. The present review provides a
   detailed overview of the challenges in microalgae production processes
   for bioenergy purposes with supporting techno-economic assessments
   related to microalgae cultivation, harvesting and downstream processes
   required for crude oil or biofuel production. In addition, biorefinery
   approaches that can valorize the by-products or co-products in
   microalgae production and enhance the techno-economics of the production
   process are discussed.

AB Biodiesel has been identified to be a suitable biodegradable substitute
   to petro-diesel. The Egyptian consumption rate of fossil diesel is
   approximately 37 kt per day from which 50-60% are imported. Using algal
   biofuels has led to a potential techno-economic assessment of 1.0
   million ton (MT) biodiesel to be produced from microalgae grown on
   domestic wastewater via heterogeneous transesterification catalysis
   using sodium orthosilicate (Na4SiO4) as catalyst in order to minimize
   the diesel shortage in Egypt and mandating B5 by 2020. Process equipment
   and units required have been sized with an accuracy of 20%. Mass
   balance, total capital investment (TCI), total production cost (TPC) and
   economic potential (EP) have all been assessed based on the marketed
   biodiesel price of US$1000 per ton and an evaluated Nannochloropsis sp.
   algal biomass cost of US$400 per ton. An algal biodiesel project of 1.0
   MT has been proven to be feasible with return on investment (ROI) and
   pay-back period of 41% and 2 years, respectively. A break-even analysis
   has disclosed that the cost of algal biodiesel that renders the project
   feasible is should be above US$843 per ton while the cost of algal
   biomass should not exceed US$461 per ton. Furthermore, sensitivity
   analysis was evaluated on variations in microalgae lipids content using
   ROI and payback time. The results obtained using Tornado Chart
   recommended that the minimum oil content should be 35% for profitable
   algal biodiesel business. Finally, a comparison between the
   investigations of algal biofuel versus Jatropha curcas biodiesel was
   performed, and positive prospects were detected for industrializing
   algal biodiesel whenever Brent Crude Oil Spot exceeds US$100 per barrel.

U1 0
U2 76
AB Energy is the key determinant for the economic and sustainable growth
   worldwide. Presently, approximate 80% of total energy derived from
   fossil fuel is mainly used for transport sector. The continuous
   depletion of fossil fuel resources and emission of greenhouse gases
   encourage to search an alternative source of fuel e.g. biodiesel and
   bioethanol. Biodiesel can be considered as a substitute of diesel
   because it has similar fuel properties as diesel excluding oxidation
   stability and cold flow properties (CFP). CFP comprises of Cloud point
   (CP) and pour point (PP) properties. CFP is being considered as the
   important challenges for biodiesel under low temperature and need to
   analyze adequately. Biodiesel led to crystallization at low temperature
   and it can clog the filters or even becomes so viscous causing difficult
   in pumping from the fuel tank to the engine and also creates fuel
   starvation and operational problem. In this study firstly the oils can
   be classified on the basis of diesel CP and PP into three main
   categories: best, moderate and poor oils. According to the
   classification, fourteen edible and non-edible oils and three microalgal
   oils are found as best, fourteen non-edible oil and five microalgal as
   moderate and fifteen non-edible oils and twenty eight microalgal oils as
   poor oils respectively These oils can be further classified on the basis
   of both CFP and oxidation stability. The results of classification shows
   that only three edible and non-edible oils Almond kenal (Prunus dulcis),
   Gopher plant (Euphorbia lathyris L.) and Seed oil (Crambe abyssinica)
   and one microalgal oils Scenedesmus oil is found suitable for biodiesel
   production, while other oils requires substantial amount of antioxidant
   or cold flow improver to meet the biodiesel quality. As per
   availability, CFP and oxidation stability, the oils can be recommended
   for biodiesel production. These oils can be recommended for biodiesel
   production having best CFP and oxidation stability.

SO Science of the Total Environment

PY 2020
U1 2
U2 74
AB Nannochloropsis sp. has received increased attention by researchers in
   recent years due to its complexity and abundance of lipid structures.
   The lipids of this microalgae species have been identified to contain
   large quantities of neutral lipids which are capable of producing raw
   materials for nutraceuticals, food additives and biofuels. The
   production of biodiesel has received the greatest attention as there is
   an increase in global demand for both more fuel and more environmentally
   sustainable methods to produce such resources. The greatest challenges
   facing industries to mass produce viable products from microalgae
   involve the degradation of the cell wall and extracting the fatty acid
   of interest due to high costs. Various studies have shown that the
   extraction lipids from the microalgae can greatly influence the overall
   fatty acid composition. Different extraction methods can result in
   recovering higher quantities of either saturated fatty acids,
   monounsaturated fatty acids or polyunsaturated fatty acids. Biodiesel
   production requires higher quantities of saturated fatty acids and
   monosaturated fatty acids as increased quantities of polyunsaturated
   fatty acids result in oxidation which decreases the performance of the
   biodiesel. Whereas, polyunsaturated fatty acids are required in order to
   produce pharmaceuticals and food additives such as omega 3. This review
   will focus on how different in-situ extraction methods for lipid and
   fatty acid recovery, influence the fatty acid composition of various
   Nannochloropsis species (oculate, gaditana, salina and oceanica). The
   mechanical methods (microwave, ultrasonic and supercritical-carbon
   dioxide) of extraction for Nannochloropsis sp. will be critically
   evaluated. The use of enzymes will also be addressed, for their ability
   to extract fatty acids in a more environmentally friendly manner. This
   paper will report on the viable by-products which can be produced using
   different extraction methods.

AB CO2-induced climate change drives the development of renewable processes
   for industrial products. Algae processes can actively fix and convert
   CO2 into value adding products, such as oils. Algae lipids hence
   counteract climate change and provide access to renewable commodities.
   In this context, valorization of algal residues remaining after oil
   extraction is a challenge for the emerging cyclic bioeconomy. This study
   focuses on the valorization of oil-extracted algae residues derived from
   the halophilic strain Scenedesmus obliquus via anaerobic digestion. We
   examined the effect of prior oil extraction on microbial digestibility
   and increasing salt content in the substrate with regard to biogas yield
   and composition. Our cumulative data demonstrate that the supercritical
   CO2 oil extraction acts as a physical pretreatment that facilitates
   enhanced hydrolysis of both polymeric call wall carbohydrates and
   cellular proteins, providing methane yields of 213.2 LN kg-1 VS day-1.
   Methane yields were 20% higher than literature values obtained with the
   same algae strain in the absence of prior oil extraction. We obtained
   these superior results albeit all lipids and nonpolar proteins had been
   extracted from the biogas substrate. Our data indicate that continuous
   anaerobic digestion without loss of fermentation efficiency is feasible
   up to a salt concentration of 2% w/v, if conventional, agricultural
   biogas plants are gradually adapted to the salt content of the
   substrate. Monofermentation of the investigated oil-extracted algae
   residue is technically feasible at loading rates of 1.5 kg VS m-3 day-1,
   but a supplementation with carbohydrate rich biomass would prove
   beneficial to alleviate ammonia inhibition.

AB Microalgal biomass can be used to derive many different types of
   biofuels. In order to widely commercialize this technology, its
   limitations and weaknesses must be eliminated. Many technical and
   economic issues also need to be clarified and unknowns answered.
   Microalgae-based technologies have been shown to be versatile, efficient
   and suitable for practical and commercial use. However, the current
   technological readiness level (TRL) of most microalgae-based bioenergy
   production systems precludes their quick and widespread implementation.
   Their development is limited by a combination of factors that must be
   precisely identified, after which their negative impact on scale-up
   prospects can be eliminated or minimized. The present study identifies
   the main barriers to the development of industrial microalgae-production
   and microalgae-to-biofuel systems. In addition, it proposes measures and
   efforts necessary to achieve a higher TRL, which will provide investors
   with sought-after performance and cost-efficiency data for the given
   project. The main barriers to the development of microalgae cultivation
   and processing systems have been identified to include: the complex
   nature of the cultivation process with multiple variables involved; lack
   of sufficient data from pilot-scale and near-full-scale plants, which
   often precludes reliable life cycle assessment (LCA); and insufficient
   legal assistance, advisory assistance, subsidies and funding for
   innovative projects. Potential ways of improving performance and
   competitiveness of microalgae-based systems include: process
   optimization techniques, genetic engineering, yield improvement through
   advanced process control and monitoring, use of waste as feedstock and
   dedicated support programs. The presented summary of the current stage
   of microalgal biofuel production technology development indicates the
   directions for further research and implementation work, which are
   necessary for the final verification of the application potential of
   these solutions.

   temperatures (10 and 20°C) and two nutrient regimes (deplete and

   rate and lipid content was observed. Multiple stressors have no additive
   effect on lipid accumulation. Total oil content (fatty acid methyl
   esters, FAMEs, pg cell-1) was increased more by nutrient limitation than
   by temperature stress. In response to nutrient stress, N. oculata
   emerged as the most robust species with an increase in lipid
   accumulation of up to three to four-fold compared to the accumulation
   under nutrient sufficient conditions. Although stress conditions led to
   reduced fatty acid unsaturation in most taxa due to increased
   triacylglycerol (TAG) production, a high proportion of eicosapentaenoic
   acid (EPA) was maintained in O. aurita.

U2 102
AB Dunaliella salina is well-known for its high content in carotenoids and
   glycerol. Nevertheless, Dunaliella salina has also a high content in
   lipids, including polar lipids, which are suitable for
   nutraceutical/cosmeceutical applications. This work proposes a
   sustainable process to maximise the potential of Dunaliella salina for
   the production of distinct fractions of carotenoids, glycerol, polar
   lipids and proteins, which may contribute to improve the revenues of the
   microalgae industry. In this work, extraction with non-hazardous
   solvents and organic solvent nanofiltration are integrated, in order to
   obtain added-value products and glycerol. Also, aiming to separate
   carotenoids from glycerides, a saponification process is proposed. High
   overall recoveries were obtained for carotenoids (85%), glycerol (86%),
   polar lipids (94%) and proteins (95%). In order to evaluate the
   profitability of the proposed biorefinery, an economic assessment was
   accomplished. Both CAPEX and OPEX (Capital and Operating expenditure)
   were calculated, likewise the Return of Investment (ROI).

TI Development and validation of a screening procedure of microalgae for

   Nannochloropsis.
SO Bioresource Technology
VL 177
PS 224-232
PY 2015
U1 0
U2 85
AB Nannochloropsis has emerged as a promising alga for biodiesel
   production. However, the genus consists of 6 species and hundreds of
   strains making strain selection a challenge. Furthermore, oil
   productivity is instrumental to economic viability of any algal strain
   for industrial production, which is dependent on growth rate and oil
   content. In most cases, these two parameters have been studied
   independently. Thus, the goal of this study is to provide a combined
   method for evaluating strain performance in specially designed
   photobioreactors together with an in-depth lipidomic analyses. The nine
   strains of Nannochloropsis tested showed considerable variations in
   productivity and lipidomics highlighting the importance of strain
   selection. Finally, Nannochloropsis gaditana CCMP527 and Nannochloropsis
   salina CCMP537 emerged as the two most promising strains, with an oil
   content of 37 and 27 dry wt% after 11-day nitrogen starvation,
   respectively, resulting in TAG productivity of 13*10-3 and 18*10-3 kg
   m-3 d-1, respectively.

TI Critical review on production, characterization and applications of
   microalgal hydrochar: insights on circular bioeconomy through
   hydrothermal carbonization.
SO Chemical Engineering Journal
VL 473
PY 2023
U1 9
U2 35
AB Exploitation of microalgal biomass as a valuable resource is hindered by
   the challenges associated with high downstream processing costs,
   including biomass harvesting, drying, and product extraction. Direct
   utilization of microalgae as a solid fuel source, soil conditioner,
   capacitor or adsorbent material raises environmental concerns.
   Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a highly efficient and promising
   technology for microalgal biomass conversion. This comprehensive review
   provides an in-depth understanding of the HTC reaction mechanisms
   involved in microalgal hydrochar production, shedding light on the
   underlying processes and factors affecting the quality of hydrochar. HTC
   has the potential to improve fixed carbon content, thermal stability and
   nutrient availability in the resulting hydrochar. Furthermore, this
   review explores the integration of HTC with anaerobic digestion (AD) to
   establish a circular bioeconomy, thereby promoting sustainability in
   energy generation. The synergistic combination offers a promising
   approach for the efficient utilization of microalgal biomass, where
   hydrochar can serve as a renewable energy source while the aqueous
   fraction can be utilized as a nutrient-rich feedstock for biogas
   production. By highlighting the potential benefits and futuristic
   directives associated with microalgal biomass valorisation through HTC,
   this review aims to contribute to the development of sustainable waste
   management strategies for recovery of value-added compounds from
   microalgae. Ultimately, this review strives to foster the transition
   towards a more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient
   bioeconomy.

TI Circular zero-residue process using microalgae for efficient water
   decontamination, biofuel production, and carbon dioxide fixation.
SO Chemical Engineering Journal
VL 388
PY 2020
U1 7
U2 70
AB Microalgae can be easily integrated into an effective and scalable
   zero-carbon-emission circular process that exploits their CO2 fixation
   and wastewater remediation capabilities while simultaneously using their
   residues as an energy and biofuel source to power global sustainable
   development. Herein, the use of glycogen-rich Arthrospira platensis
   microalgae for efficient water decontamination, biofuel production, and
   CO2 fixation is explored. The circular process is initiated by efficient
   bioremediation of heavy metals (removal >99%) during microalgal growth,
   followed by bioethanol production, pellet production, and mineralization
   of persistent organic pollutants from wastewater, and is accompanied by
   CO2 fixation and/or oxygen production. Microalgal biomass generated
   during heavy metal bioremediation is used to produce bioethanol via
   simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (0.4 L per kg of dried
   microalgal biomass). The residual biomass obtained after bioethanol
   production is dried and compressed into pellets for its use as a fuel in
   biomass boilers (calorific power = 20.6  0.2 MJ kg-1). The iron-rich
   ashes produced during pellet combustion are subsequently used as
   heterogeneous re-usable Fenton-like catalysts for the photo-Fenton
   degradation (mineralization >99%) of persistent organic pollutants.
   Finally, the low-activity ashes are incorporated into an ash-based
   medium for the efficient cultivation of microalgae. For each proposed
   step, product characterization and evaluation were conducted to optimize
   and enhance the process performance while minimizing negative effects on
   the environment.

AB Biofuels are the promising sources which are produced by various
   microalgae or in the form of metabolic by-products from organic or food
   waste products. Microalgae have been widely reported for the production
   of biofuels since these have a high storage of lipids as
   triacylglycerides, which can mainly be converted into biofuels.
   Recently, products such as biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas have renewed
   the interest toward the microalgae. The proteomics alone will not pave
   the way toward finding an ideal alga which will fulfill the current
   energy demands, but a combined approach of proteomics, genomics and
   bioinformatics can be pivotal for a sustainable solution. The present
   review emphasizes various technologies currently involved in algal
   proteomics for the efficient production of biofuels.

AB The potential of algal biomass as a source of liquid and gaseous
   biofuels has been the subject of considerable research over the past few
   decades, with researchers strongly agreeing that algae have the
   potential of becoming a viable aquatic energy crop with a higher energy
   potential compared to that from either terrestrial biomass or municipal
   solid waste. However, neither microalgae nor seaweed are currently
   cultivated solely for energy purposes due to the high costs of
   harvesting, concentrating and drying. Anaerobic digestion of algal
   biomass could theoretically reduce costs associated with drying wet
   biomass before processing, but practical yields of biogas from digestion
   of many algae are substantially below the theoretical maximum. New
   processing methods are needed to reduce costs and increase the net
   energy balance. This review examines the biochemical and structural
   properties of seaweeds and of microalgal biomass that has been produced
   as part of the treatment of wastewater, and discusses some of the
   significant hurdles and recent initiatives for producing biogas from
   their anaerobic digestion.

AB In the context of global advancements, the imperative of a sustainable
   energy supply looms large. Biomass, an adaptable and renewable resource,
   has garnered attention for its potential contributions, although
   economic uncertainties persist due to the intricate web of processing
   pathways. In response, the biorefinery concept emerges as a structured
   strategy to optimize the processing of microalgae and municipal solid
   waste (MSW), capitalizing on their multifaceted potential to yield
   diverse end-products. This review underscores the critical significance
   of a cohesive biorefinery paradigm that unites the processing of
   microalgae and MSW, unveiling their capacity to generate a spectrum of
   high-value products. The utilization of mixed-integer linear programming
   paves the way for an optimal biorefinery model that navigates through
   complex decisions. Challenges encompass the array of diverse feedstocks
   and the preliminary nature of data availability. The overarching goal of
   this research is to discern optimal pathways for the conversion of MSW
   and microalgae into energy and valuable products, with a focus on
   enhancing waste utilization and augmenting the energy supply. In the
   broader landscape, this comprehensive review advances strategies for
   sustainable energy generation and waste management, invigorating
   innovative approaches to shape future progress. By illuminating pathways
   towards maximizing the potential of biomass resources, this review
   contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable energy and waste
   utilization.

AB Background: Carbon capture using alkaliphilic cyanobacteria can be an
   energy-efficient and environmentally friendly process for producing
   bioenergy and bioproducts. The inefficiency of current harvesting and
   downstream processes, however, hinders large-scale feasibility. The high
   alkalinity of the biomass also introduces extra challenges, such as
   potential corrosion, inhibitory effects, or contamination of the final
   products. Thus, it is critical to identify low cost and energy-efficient
   downstream processes. Results: Autofermentation was investigated as an
   energy-efficient and low-cost biomass pre-treatment method to reduce pH
   to levels suitable for downstream processes, enabling the conversion of
   cyanobacterial biomass into hydrogen and organic acids using
   cyanobacteria's own fermentative pathways. Temperature, initial biomass
   concentration, and oxygen presence were found to affect yield and
   distribution of organic acids. Autofermentation of alkaline
   cyanobacterial biomass was found to be a viable approach to produce
   hydrogen and organic acids simultaneously, while enabling the successful
   conversion of biomass to biogas. Between 5.8 and 60% of the initial
   carbon was converted into organic acids, 8.7-25% was obtained as soluble
   protein, and 16-72% stayed in the biomass. Interestingly, we found that
   extensive dewatering is not needed to effectively process the alkaline
   cyanobacterial biomass. Using natural settling as the only harvesting
   and dewatering method resulted in a slurry with relatively low biomass
   concentration. Nevertheless, autofermentation of this slurry led to the
   maximum total organic acid yield (60% C mol/C mol biomass) and hydrogen
   yield (326.1 mol/g AFDM). Conclusion: Autofermentation is a simple, but
   highly effective pretreatment that can play a significant role within a
   cyanobacterial-based biorefinery platform by enabling the conversion of
   alkaline cyanobacterial biomass into organic acids, hydrogen, and
   methane via anaerobic digestion without the addition of energy or
   chemicals.

AB Algae have long been investigated as a plausible reserve of several
   biofuel and bioactive compounds attributed to their fast-growing
   characteristics, shorter doubling time, and capability of accumulating
   lipids. Compounds extracted from algae are being studied in various
   sectors namely, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, cancer biology, nanoscience,
   food industry, etc. In view of the rich potentials of algae, this
   present review is aimed to highlight the significance of different
   cultivation aspects of microalgae like open pond and photobioreactor and
   advantages and disadvantages thereof. This state-of-the-art review
   provides the limitations of energy (biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen,
   biomethane) products obtained from the algae in a perspective of
   shifting lab-scale into a field scale. In addition to the cultivation
   systems and biofuels, several non-energy products or value-added
   products obtained from algae were critically compared and presented.
   Data from plethora literatures discussing the advanced methods for the
   extraction of omega-3, omega-6 fatty acids, vitamins and nanoparticles
   from algae have been discussed extensively. Further, bioactive compounds
   extracted from several algal strains were listed. Considering the health
   benefits, anti-angiogenic, and anti-cancer properties of algal bioactive
   compounds were described along with other industrial applications.
   Overall, this comprehensive review will help in understanding status of
   algal biofuel, cultivation systems, metabolites and their application
   for the betterment of the human society.

AB BACKGROUND: Conventional biodiesel production relies on
   trans-esterification of lipids extracted from vegetable crops. However,
   the use of valuable vegetable food stocks as raw material for biodiesel
   production makes it an unfeasibly expensive process. Used cooking oil is
   a finite resource and requires extra downstream processing, which
   affects the amount of biodiesel that can be produced and the economics
   of the process. Lipids extracted from microalgae are considered an
   alternative raw material for biodiesel production. This is primarily due
   to the fast growth rate of these species in a simple aquaculture
   environment. However, the dilute nature of microalgae culture puts a
   huge economic burden on the dewatering process especially on an
   industrial scale. This current study explores the performance and
   economic viability of chemical flocculation and tangential flow
   filtration (TFF) for the dewatering ofTetraselmis suecicamicroalgae
   culture. RESULT: Results show that TFF concentrates the microalgae
   feedstock up to 148 times by consuming 2.06 kWh m-3of energy while
   flocculation consumes 14.81 kWh m-3to concentrate the microalgae up to
   357 times. Economic evaluation demonstrates that even though TFF has
   higher initial capital investment than polymer flocculation, the payback
   period for TFF at the upper extreme of microalgae revenue is 1.5 years
   while that of flocculation is 3 years. CONCLUSION: These results
   illustrate that improved dewatering levels can be achieved more
   economically by employing TFF. The performances of these two techniques
   are also compared with other dewatering techniques.

AB Microalgae have been largely used as a source of human and animal food,
   essential fatty acids for the treatment and prevention of diseases, and
   as a source of pigments for natural colorants. They have also been
   considered a promising feedstock for the production of liquid biofuels,
   as they can achieve oil yields considerably higher than oilseed crops.
   However, microalgae-based biofuels are not yet economically feasible due
   to high operating costs and large energy demands, which result in poor
   net energy returns and unattractive internal rates of return. Biomass
   cultivation, nutrient recycling, water usage, and biomass harvesting are
   critical process issues. Refining the biomass in its various
   constituents presents an opportunity for making microalgal lipids
   economically viable for bioenergy production, supported on high
   added-value co-products. Hence, this review aims to consolidate the
   public information on microalgal biomass processing and to present an
   analysis of the best options for integrating individually studied
   processes in an energy-driven biorefinery. From this analysis, a
   preliminary proposal of a biorefinery flow diagram is presented, along
   with recommendations for further research and technology development in
   the critical areas for accelerating the development of microalgae
   biorefineries.

AB Lightning belongs among critical process parameters that significantly
   affect growth and microalgal yield in photobioreactors. Sunshine or
   artificial lighting is applied to irradiate photobioreactors.
   Nevertheless, sunshine lighting is limited by locality and weather
   conditions. On the contrary, there is a typical demand for nonstop or
   8000 annual working hours for industrial biorefineries using
   photobioreactors as an economic point of view. Thus the paper scopes to
   evaluate the fundamental economic feasibility of artificial lightning
   provided by electric energy from fossil fuels, renewable energy systems,
   or their mutual combinations. The economic feasibility is discussed
   concerning local annual sunshine hours for a model 1-ha microalgae
   cultivation plant. It was found that combined sunlight, solar energy-
   and electric energy-based artificial lighting has a significant positive
   effect on the economic behavior of a model biorefinery. The mutual
   combination of sunshine, solar energy- and electric artificial
   energy-based light evinces a profit increase of 2.18 for microalgal
   powder, 3.09 for microalgal lipids and 4.11 for microalga carotenoids
   production technologies all compared only to sun lighted
   photobioreactors. Nevertheless, capital investments in artificial
   lightings, solar systems, or photobioreactors, and high operating
   expenses represent the dominant risk factors of the discussed microalgal
   biorefinery. Developing cheap and reliable artificial lighting systems,
   solar and energy storage systems, and improving process characteristics
   of microalgal cultivation (process stability, high concentrated
   suspension in thin layer photobioreactors avoiding biofilm formation)
   were identified as the essential research needs and challenges to
   improve the economic feasibility of artificially lighted microalgal
   biorefinery.

AB Biomass is a crucial energy resource used for the generation of
   electricity and transportation fuels. Microalgae exhibit a high content
   of biocomponents which makes them a potential feedstock for the
   generation of ecofriendly biofuels. Biofuels derived from microalgae are
   suitable carbon-neutral replacements for petroleum. Fermentation is the
   major process for metabolic conversion of microalgal biocompounds into
   biofuels such as bioethanol and higher alcohols. In this review, we
   explored the use of all three major biocomponents of microalgal biomass
   including carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids for maximum biofuel
   generation. Application of several pretreatment methods for enhancement
   the bioavailability of substrates (simple sugar, amino acid, and fatty
   acid) was discussed. This review goes one step further to discuss how to
   direct these biocomponents for the generation of various biofuels
   (bioethanol, higher alcohol, and biodiesel) through fermentation and
   transesterification processes. Such an approach would result in the
   maximum utilization of biomasses for economically feasible biofuel
   production.

AB As an alternative fuel biodiesel has become increasingly important due
   to diminishing petroleum reserves and adverse environmental consequences
   of exhaust gases from petroleum-fueled engines. Recently, research
   interest has focused on the production of biofuel from microalgae.
   Cyanobacteria appeared to be suitable candidates for cultivation in
   wastes and wastewaters because they produce biomass in satisfactory
   quantity and can be harvested relatively easily due to their size and
   structure. In addition, their biomass composition can be manipulated by
   several environmental and operational factors to produce biomass with
   concrete characteristics. Herein, we review the culture of cyanobacteria
   in wastewaters and also the potential resources that can be transformed
   into biodiesel successfully for meeting the ever-increasing demand for
   biodiesel production.

AB Microalgae are a potential source for various valuable chemicals for
   commercial applications ranging from nutraceuticals to fuels. Objective
   in a biorefinery is to utilize biomass ingredients efficiently similarly
   to petroleum refineries in which oil is fractionated in fuels and a
   variety of products with higher value. Downstream processes in
   microalgae biorefineries consist of different steps whereof cell
   disruption is the most crucial part. To maintain the functionality of
   algae biochemicals during cell disruption while obtaining high
   disruption yields is an important challenge. Despite this need, studies
   on mild disruption of microalgae cells are limited. This review article
   focuses on the evaluation of conventional and emerging cell disruption
   technologies, and a comparison thereof with respect to their potential
   for the future microalgae biorefineries. The discussed techniques are
   bead milling, high pressure homogenization, high speed homogenization,
   ultrasonication, microwave treatment, pulsed electric field treatment,
   non-mechanical cell disruption and some emerging technologies.

AB The aim of the present study was to analyze studies that cultivate
   microalgae in a consortium using effluent as a nutrient source, and
   later use the biomass to produce other biocompounds. The production of
   microalgal biomass, which is associated with the remediation of
   effluent, production of biofuels, and by-products of high added value
   (such as bioethanol, biomethane, biodiesel, biofertilizers, and
   biochar), has been highlighted among the types of sustainable
   refineries. Further, consortium cultures, with interactions between
   microalgae and bacteria, fungi, and protozoa at the cellular level, can
   generate mutual relationships in the conversion and use of nutrients.
   Large-scale microalgae cultivation enables the mitigation of the
   presence of inorganic carbon in the atmosphere through microalgal
   cellular respiration. To assess the economic and environmental
   sustainability of the promotion of technologies that use microalgae, the
   relationships between the bioeconomy and renewable energy must be
   established. The present study sought to demonstrate the relationship
   between the factors associated with the cultivation of microalgae using
   effluents and the use of microalgal biomass in the production of
   biocomposites. Furthermore, whether these factors could favor the
   reduction of costs related to the production processes and boost the
   biorefinery industry were also investigated.

AB Concerns about rising energy demand, fossil fuel depletion, and global
   warming have increased interest in developing and utilizing alternate
   renewable energy sources. Among the available renewable resources,
   microalgae biomass, a third-generation feedstock, is promising for
   energy production due to its rich biochemical composition, metabolic
   elasticity, and ability to produce numerous bioenergy products,
   including biomethane, biohydrogen, and bioethanol. However, the true
   potential of microalgae biomass in the future bioenergy economy is yet
   to be realized. This review provides a comprehensive overview of various
   biochemical conversion processes (anaerobic digestion, direct
   biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, photo fermentation, dark
   fermentation, microalgae-catalyzed photo fermentation,
   microalgae-catalyzed dark fermentation, and traditional alcoholic
   fermentation by ethanologenic microorganisms) that could be adapted to
   transform microalgae biomass into different bioenergy products. Recent
   advances in biochemical conversion processes are compiled and critically
   analyzed, and their limitations in terms of process viability, efficacy,
   scalability, and economic and environmental sustainability are
   highlighted. Based on the current research stage and technological
   development, biomethane production from anaerobic digestion and
   bioethanol production from traditional fermentation are identified as
   promising methods for the future commercialization of microalgae-based
   bioenergy. However, significant challenges to these technologies'
   commercialization remain, including the high microalgae production costs
   and low energy recovery efficiency. Future research should focus on
   reducing microalgae production costs, developing an integrated
   biorefinery approach, and effectively utilizing artificial intelligence
   tools for process optimization and scale-up to solve the current
   challenges and accelerate the development of microalgae-based bioenergy.

AB Recently, algal biorefinery concepts have been gaining a lot of
   attention. The rapidly evolving algae mediated bioeconomy places an
   increased emphasis on characterizing and addressing the significant need
   to develop products for a sustainable future. These emerging
   developments must always be accompanied by the principles of economic
   and environmental sustainability, which will aid in unravelling the
   contentious link between the bioproduct-energy-ecosystem that the algae
   exist. Understanding the metabolic activities to produce biofuels and
   bioproducts can shed light on the critical barriers that currently limit
   net carbon utilization and photosynthetic activity, which will
   eventually steer towards efficient production and some insights on
   financial prospects in the context of limited resources. Researchers
   have studied numerous potential pathways as well as addressed and
   identified significant obstacles in the theoretical aspect of macro- and
   microalgal biorefinery systems in order to improve the prospect. To
   date, researchers have studied every promising biorefinery product,
   classified their appropriate transformation and extraction processes,
   along with their values and commercial viability. This review
   comprehensively discusses the updates on biorefinery products derived
   from marine algae along with the challenges and opportunities for
   obtaining valuable products from the marine algal biomass. Considering
   possible technological advances, herein, the products of algal
   biotechnology and their unique applications have been described to
   demonstrate how marine algae could provide modern, inexpensive, along
   with sustainable remedies for humans in the future.

AB Lipid droplet is the major site of neutral lipid storage in eukaryotic
   cells, and increasing evidence show its involvement in numerous cellular
   processes such as lipid homeostasis, signaling, trafficking and
   inter-organelle communications. Although the biogenesis, structure, and
   functions of lipid droplets have been well documented for seeds of
   vascular plants, mammalian adipose tissues, insects and yeasts, relative
   little is known about lipid droplets in microalgae. Over the past 5
   years, the growing interest of microalgae as a platform for biofuel,
   green chemicals or value-added polyunsaturated fatty acid production has
   brought algal lipid droplets into spotlight. Studies conducted on the
   green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other model microalgae
   such as Haematococcus and Nannochloropsis species have led to the
   identification of proteins associated with lipid droplets, which include
   putative structural proteins different from plant oleosins and animal
   perilipins, as well as candidate proteins for lipid biosynthesis,
   mobilization, trafficking and homeostasis. Biochemical and microscopy
   studies have also started to shed light on the role of chloroplasts in
   the biogenesis of lipid droplets in Chlamydomonas.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment using activated sludge cannot
   efficiently eliminate nitrogen and phosphorus, thus engendering the risk
   of water eutrophication and ecosystem disruption. Fortunately, a new
   wastewater treatment process applying microalgae-bacteria consortia has
   attracted considerable interests due to its excellent performance of
   nutrients removal. Moreover, some bacteria facilitate the harvest of
   microalgal biomass through bio-flocculation. Additionally, while
   stimulating the functional bacteria, the improved biomass and enriched
   components also brighten bioenergy production from the perspective of
   practical applications. Thus, this review first summarizes the current
   development of nutrients removal and mutualistic interaction using
   microalgae-bacteria consortia. Then, advancements in bio-flocculation
   are completely described and the corresponding mechanisms are thoroughly
   revealed. Eventually, the recent advances of bioenergy production (i.e.,
   biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioethanol, and bioelectricity) using
   microalgae-bacteria consortia are comprehensively discussed. Together,
   this review will provide the ongoing challenges and future developmental
   directions for better converting nitrogen and phosphorus wastewater into
   bioenergy using microalgae-bacteria consortia.

   source of active ingredients. In addition, biotechnology research has
   demonstrated the remarkable potential of microalgae in the sectors of
   bioenergy, food, pharmaceuticals and biomedicine. This paper provides a
   review on the various microalgae products and applications, especially
   in nutrition and health and addresses the procedures and considerations
   in the design and development of microalgae (ChlorellaandSpirulina)
   functional foods, such as characterization of bioactivity and
   immunostimulatory properties. It also describes the Inmugal project,
   which main objective is to strengthen the immune system using specific
   functional foods based on compounds from microalgae. Market prospects
   for the manufacture of microalgae products are considered as well.

AB Biomass-derived fuels can contribute to energy sustainability through
   diversifying energy supply and mitigating carbon emissions. However, the
   biomass chemistry poses an important challenge, i.e., the effective
   hydrogen to carbon ratio is significantly lower for biomass compared to
   petroleum, and biomass conversion technologies produce a large amount of
   carbon dioxide by-product. Therefore, CO2 capture and utilization will
   be an indispensable element of future biorefineries. The present
   research explores the economic feasibility and environmental performance
   of utilizing CO2 from biomass pyrolysis for biodiesel production via
   microalgae. The results suggest that it is possible to increase biomass
   to fuel conversion from 55% to 73%. In addition, if subsidies and fuel
   taxes are included in the economic analysis, the extra produced fuel can
   compensate the cost of CO2 utilization, and is competitive with
   petroleum-derived fuels. Finally, the proposed integrated refinery shows
   promise as CO2 in the flue gas is reduced from 45% of total input carbon
   to 6% with another 19% in biomass residue waste streams.

AB Traditional wastewater treatment has been aimed solely at sanitation by
   removing contaminants, yet actual issues of climate change and depletion
   of natural resources are calling for methods that both remove
   contaminants and convert waste into chemicals and fuels. In particular,
   biological treatments with synergic coupling of microalgae and bacteria
   appear promising to remove organic, inorganic, and pathogen contaminants
   and to generate biofuels. Here, we review the use of algae and bacteria
   in the treatment and valorization of wastewater with focus on
   cell-to-cell adhesion, wastewater properties, and techniques for algae
   harvesting and production of biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen,
   exopolysaccarides, biofertilizers, and animal feeds.

AB Biofuel is considered as a solution to substitute petroleum fuel and to
   reduce the carbon dioxide emissions contributing to global warming. The
   most known biofuels used are biodiesel, bioethanol, and biohydrogen
   extracted from biomass. For a long time, these biofuels were produced
   from edible crops that compete with the food of humans and animals.
   Therefore, research is focused worldwide on alternative biomass sources.
   Scientists are looking for innovative biofuel feedstocks such as
   agricultural wastes, algae, and jatropha. The first generation of
   biodiesel mainly depended on vegetable oils for conversion to methyl
   esters and glycerol. In Johannesburg, South Africa, the 2002 World
   Summit on Sustainable Development pledged to promote renewable energy
   sources. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in
   Paris in 2015, 174 countries pledged to work together to keep global
   warming well below 2 degrees Celsius by supporting more renewable energy
   investment. Algae are one of the very promising feedstocks for biofuel
   production.

AB Nowadays, fossil fuels; including coal, oil, and natural gas; are the
   world's primary energy sources required for industry, lighting,
   transportation and heating. Their needs increased dramatically due to
   the vast expansion in human population and economy. In contrast, a
   greenhouse gas emission is a serious problem arose from such uses that
   might lead to potentially catastrophic changes in the earth's climate.
   In addition, fossil fuels are limited non-renewable resources that will
   run out in few decades. These factors motivated many researchers to
   develop a new renewable energy sources that could replace fossil fuels.
   Biodiesel is considered as the best candidate for this purpose.
   Recently, microalgae were discussed as a promising feedstock for
   biodiesel production. This review presents a critical overview of
   engineered challenges compilations related to microalgal biomass
   production. In addition, advantages and current limitations of biodiesel
   production, quantitative and qualitative feasibility of microalgal
   biodiesel, and its economic feasibility are discussed.

U2 49
AB Biodiesel is an alternative, renewable, biodegradable and
   environmentally friendly fuel for transportation, with properties like
   petroleum-derived diesel, and can be used directly in a compression
   ignition engine without any modifications. The world's fossil fuel and
   crude oil reserves are going to dry up in the next few decades, but,
   contrariwise, an attractive, high quality, readily available and
   economically extractable oil from microalgae is a substitute feedstock
   to produce alternative biodiesel fuel for the transportation sector in
   the future. Microalgae have a higher biomass productivity
   (tons/hectare/year) and lipid yield (kg/kg of algal biomass) as compared
   to vegetable oil crops. To overcome the problem of energy deficiency in
   developing countries, like Pakistan, and boost their economic growth,
   alternative fuels are proving very important for environment-friendly
   and sustainable development, especially in the last few decades.
   Different research studies on microalgae cultivation, characterization
   of microalgae oil (lipids), and evaluations of its socio-economic
   feasibility to produce renewable biodiesel have been conducted in the
   past in Pakistan for its future prospects. This review paper includes
   the overall summary and compilation of the microalgae research conducted
   in Pakistan on biodiesel production and includes the algal biodiesel
   production cost analysis. The studies showed promising results for
   harnessing microalgae and using its lipids to produce biodiesel with
   favourable properties that were comparable to the conventional diesel in
   Pakistan. The information related to the microalgae research will help
   stakeholders and governmental organisations working in the renewable
   energy sector to consider its cultivation on a large scale, using waste
   water as a feedstock to produce biodiesel to meet the target set by the
   Government of Pakistan of using 10% blended biodiesel by the year 2025
   in Pakistan.

AB Recent research interest has focused on microalgae cultivation for
   biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading due to the requirement
   of high efficiency for nutrient uptake and CO2capture, with economic
   feasibility and environmental benefits. Numerous studies have suggested
   that biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading can occur
   simultaneously via microalgae-based technology. However, there is no
   comprehensive review on this technology with respect to the nutrient
   removal from biogas slurry and biogas upgrading. This article summarizes
   microalgal cultivation with biogas slurry and biogas from anaerobic
   digestion. The parameters, techniques, and modes of microalgae
   cultivation have been discussed in detail to achieve high efficiency in
   biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading. In addition, the
   evaluation of energy efficiency and safety has also been explored.
   Compared with mono-cultivation of microalgae and co-cultivation of
   microalgae and bacteria, microalgae-fungi symbiosis has demonstrated
   greater development prospect and higher energy efficiency and the energy
   consumption for pollutants and CO2removal were 14.2-39.0% . USD-1and
   19.9-23.3% . USD-1, respectively. Further, a sustainable recycling
   scheme is proposed for the purification of biogas slurry from anaerobic
   digestion process and biogas upgrading via microalgae-based technology.

AB Development of biofuels from renewable resources is critical to the
   sustainability of the world's economy and to slow down the global
   climate change. Currently, a significant amount of bioethanol and
   biodiesel are produced as biofuels to partially replace gasoline and
   diesel, respectively, in the transportation sector worldwide. However,
   these biofuels represent a tiny portion (<4%) of the total fuels
   consumed. Furthermore, bioethanol is produced predominantly from
   sugarcane and corn, and biodiesel from crop and plant oils. Production
   of these raw materials is competing for the limited arable land against
   food and feed production. It is not feasible to tremendously increase
   biofuel production using the current technologies. Therefore, it is
   critical to investigate advanced or 2nd generation biofuel production
   technologies. This article is trying to summarize the current status of
   the 2nd generation biofuel technologies including bioethanol from
   lignocellulosic materials and biodiesel from microalgae. The summary
   includes the descriptions of the technologies, their advantages and
   challenges, feedstocks for the 2nd generation biofuels, the key barriers
   to their commercial applications, and future perspectives of the
   advanced technologies.

AB Microalgae have been identified as a promising option for concomitant
   bioremediation of wastewaters and biodiesel generation. However, the
   nutritional composition of wastewater differs between locations, and
   some wastewater contains low nitrogen levels that inhibit microalgae
   growth, resulting in poor total nutrient removal and biomass output.
   Furthermore, the high cost of harvesting microalgae biomass is a barrier
   to commercial microalgae farming. This study aims to employ a novel
   microalga,Scenedesmussp. DDVG I for bioremediation of low-nitrogen
   domestic wastewater. The nutritional balance of the wastewater was
   achieved with the addition of urea at two different levels and then was
   used for the cultivation of microalgae. The results showed that the
   optimized nutritional condition included total nitrogen (TN) of 250 mg/L
   and total phosphorus (TP) of 5 mg/L (N250/P5). The culture cultivated in
   this optimal medium improved chemical oxygen demand (COD), TN, and TP
   removal by as much as 89.5%, 99.98%, and 99.1%,
   respectively.Scenedesmussp. DDVG I growth was likewise at its peak, with
   a value of 5.1 g/L, but with a low harvesting efficiency (0.02%).
   Subsequently,Scenedesmussp. DDVG I was co-cultured with a novel
   cyanobacterium,Limnothrixsp. DDVG II under the optimal nutritional
   condition. The results revealed a 99.5% increase in harvesting
   efficiency with effective wastewater treatment. The co-culture-derived
   biodiesel also complied with the standard specifications. Further,
   analysis of the essential amino acid content andin vitrodigestibility of
   the biomass proved its usefulness as a feed supplement. Overall, this
   study demonstrated a promising future for a cleaner environment and
   sustainable bio-economy of microalgae.

TI The dilemma and potential development of biodiesel in China - in view of
   production capacity and policy.
SO Energy for Sustainable Development
VL 75

PY 2023
U1 7
U2 53
AB China has issued a series of biodiesel-related policies to alleviate
   energy shortage anxiety and reduce carbon emissions. However, no other
   provinces or cities in China widely utilize biodiesel except Shanghai.
   This article firstly conducted a comprehensive estimation of the
   potential botanical biodiesel capacity in China. Then, we examined why
   biodiesel advancement in China was stagnated by comparing
   biodiesel-related policies in pioneer countries such as Malaysia and
   Indonesia. We found the highest mix ratio will be ~13% if all potential
   botanical oils are added to petrochemical diesel and an addition of 3%
   blending ratio can be achieved if waste cooking oils are effectively
   utilized. We concluded that despite the encouragement from policies,
   insufficient materials and lack of downstream consumptions may be the
   major reasons for the sluggish development of biodiesel in China. If
   microalgae biodiesel production technology is overcome in the future,
   China can compulsorily mix biodiesel on a large scale. This paper
   provided a comprehensive review of biodiesel-related policies in
   Malaysia, Indonesia and China, and figured out the key problems that
   hinder the promotion of biodiesel, helping to understand the dilemma and
   drive the potential development of biodiesel in China.

AB Microbial fuel cell (MFC) provides a promising technology to handle two
   problems by decomposing organic waste and power generation which is
   economical and clean source of energy. However, use of platinum catalyst
   in the MFC is quite expensive and not economically suitable for
   real-time applications that needs to find an alternative. Hence, the
   main aim of the present research is to investigate the power generation
   and food processing wastewater treatment with two types of microalgae
   (Oscillatoria sp. and Scenedesmus sp.) as a biocathode in the MFC. The
   experimental results showed that the peak power density of 32.5  0.5 and
   28.5  0.3 mW/m2was obtained forOscillatoria sp. andScenedesmus sp.,
   respectively. The MFC power generation was also investigated with
   respect to CO2supply and light intensity, respectively. The results of
   this study indicated that the possibility of bioelectricity generation
   using algae as a biocatalyst for economic feasibility and allowing the
   development of energy efficient systems for wastewater treatment.

AB In this study the heterotrophic cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris
   NIES-227 fed with glucose was investigated systematically using six
   media types; combinations of nitrogen repletion/depletion and phosphorus
   repletion/limitation/depletion. It was found that a high yield of fatty
   acids (0.88 of fed glucose-COD) and a high content of fatty acid methyl
   esters (FAMEs) (89% of dry weight) were obtained under nitrogen starved
   conditions. To our knowledge it is the first report on such high COD
   conversion yield and FAME content in microalgae. The dominant fatty acid
   (>50%) was methyl oleate (C18:1), a desirable component for biodiesel
   synthesis. FAME content under nitrogen starved conditions was
   significantly higher than under nitrogen sufficient conditions, while
   phosphorus had no significant influence, indicating that nitrogen
   starvation was the real - fatty acids trigger - in heterotrophic
   cultivation. These findings could simplify the downstream extraction
   process, such as the extrusion of oil from soybeans, and could reduce
   operating costs by improving the fatty acid yield from waste COD.

AB This article is an overview of a biosystem of food-industry wastewater
   (WW) treatment using microalgae towards circular bioeconomy through
   biosynthesis of compounds of added-value. Focusing on circular
   bioeconomy with concern to environmental pollution, the management of
   water-resource and energy-crisis could be combined; by upgrading
   conventional WW treatment and simultaneously producing a renewable and
   sustainable source of energy algal-lipids for biodiesel production.
   Phyco-remediation of food WW using microalgae has revealed many
   advantages that can fulfill new demands for the WW treatment. WWs can be
   valuable resources of micronutrients and organic content (carbon source)
   for algal cultivation. In this review, prospective routes for the
   production of value-added compounds (polysaccharides, amino acids,
   biofuels, and biopigments) along with the bioremediation of food
   industry WW have been discussed. Furthermore, limitations and issues of
   phyco-remediation of WW using microalgae have also been reviewed with
   perspectives for further research and development.

U1 1

AB Bioconversion technologies of biomass to bioethanol require intensive
   energy process due to several pretreatment steps to break down the
   biomass in order to obtain fermentable sugar for subsequent
   fermentation. Hence, a feasible approach to the production of bioethanol
   from lipid-extracted biomass of Scenedesmus dimorphus will be presented
   in this study in a biorefinery concept. The lipid-extracted biomass was
   directly subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
   thereby avoiding the costly pretreatment, lowering the contamination
   risk and reducing the complication of high sugar content. The
   technological challenges for this fermentation process were investigated
   to identify optimum conditions for amyloglucosidase enzyme activity and
   Sacchromyces cerevisiae yeast ethanolic fermentation. As a result, the
   optimum key parameters for the fermentation were identified at an enzyme
   concentration of 60 units/ml, pH 5, temperature at 36°C and yeast
   loading of 3 g/L. At the optimum condition, an overall conversion of
   more than 90% of the theoretical yield was achieved with maximum
   bioethanol yield of 0.26 g bioethanol/g lipid-extracted biomass. The
   direct usage of lipid-extracted biomass into simultaneous
   saccharification and fermentation with single enzyme ensures the
   feasibility of the biofuel produced.

AB Global uptrends in palm oil industry have been observed while a vast
   amount of waste, particularly palm oil mill effluent (POME) which is a
   type of wastewater that can cause severe environmental pollution has
   been discharged. This has caused remarkable challenges for palm oil
   mills to obey the regulations of standard discharge limits, resulting in
   development of several bioremediation methods and bioreactors, which are
   presented in this paper. For further utilisation of POME, researches
   have been carried out to develop value added products from POME and to
   make POME as energy resources. Indeed, POME with high chemical and
   biochemical oxygen demand as well as mineral content is suitable and
   useful raw material. Simultaneous wastewater treatment and production of
   bioenergy and bioproducts will make palm oil industry more clean,
   sustainable and environmentally friendly. Hence, this review
   comprehensively summarizes the production of renewable energies
   (methane, biohydrogen, syngas, biodiesel and biocrude oil) and high
   value products (microalgae, yeasts, enzymes and bioplastics) from the
   POME wastewater, critically analysing their current developments and
   future prospect. Nevertheless, there are still research needs in order
   to improve the biorefinery and bioremediation of POME.

AB In order to study the effect of phosphorus on biodiesel production from
   Scenedesmus obliquus especially under nitrogen deficiency conditions,
   six types of media with combinations of nitrogen repletion/depletion and
   phosphorus repletion/limitation/depletion were investigated in this
   study. It was found that nitrogen starvation compared to nitrogen
   repletion enhanced biodiesel productivity. Moreover, biodiesel
   productivity was further strengthened by varying the supply level of
   phosphorus from depletion, limitation, through to repletion. The maximum
   FAMEs productivity of 24.2 mg/L/day was obtained in nitrogen depletion
   with phosphorus repletion, which was two times higher than that in
   nutrient complete medium. More phosphorus was accumulated in cells under
   the nitrogen starvation with sufficient phosphorus condition, but no
   polyphosphate was formed. This study indicated that nitrogen starvation
   plus sufficient P supply might be the real "lipid trigger". Furthermore,
   results of the current study suggest a potential application for
   utilizing microalgae to combine phosphorus removal from wastewater with
   biodiesel production.

AB Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) Hermetia illucens is fastest growing and
   most promising insect species especially recommended to bring high-fat
   content as 5th generation bioenergy. The fat content can be fully
   optimized during the life-cycle of the BSFL through various organic
   dietary supplements and environmental conditions. Enriched fat can be
   obtained during the larval stages of the BSF. The presence of high
   saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in their body helps to produce 70%
   of extractable oil which can be converted into biodiesel through
   transesterification. The first-generation biodiesel process mainly
   depends on catalytic transesterification, however, BSFL had 94% of
   biodiesel production through non-catalytic transesterification. This
   increases the sustainability of producing biodiesel with less energy
   input in the process line. Other carbon emitting factors involved in the
   rearing of BSFL are less than the other biodiesel feedstocks including
   microalgae, cooking oil, and non-edible oil. Therefore, this review is
   focused on evaluating the optimum dietary source to produce fatty acid
   rich larvae and larval growth to accumulate C16-18 fatty acids in larger
   amounts from agro food waste. The process of optimization and
   biorefining of lipids using novel techniques have been discussed herein.
   The sustainability impact was evaluated from the cultivation to
   biodiesel conversion with greenhouse gas emissions scores in the entire
   life-cycle of process flow. The state-of-the-art in connecting circular
   bioeconomy loop in the search for bioenergy was meticulously covered.

AB This study assessed the recovery of natural pigments (phycobiliproteins)
   and bioenergy (biogas) from microalgae grown in wastewater. A consortium
   of microalgae, mainly composed by Nostoc, Phormidium, and Geitlerinema,
   known to have high phycobiliproteins content, was grown in
   photobioreactors. The growth medium was composed by secondary effluent
   from a high rate algal pond (HRAP) along with the anaerobic digestion
   centrate, which aimed to enhance the N/P ratio, given the lack of
   nutrients in the secondary effluent. Additionally, the centrate is still
   a challenging anaerobic digestion residue since the high nitrogen
   concentrations have to be removed before disposal. Removal efficiencies
   up to 52% of COD, 86% of NH4+-N, and 100% of phosphorus were observed.
   The biomass composition was monitored over the experimental period in
   order to ensure stable cyanobacterial dominance in the mixed culture.
   Phycocyanin and phycoerythrin were extracted from harvested biomass,
   achieving maximum concentrations of 20.1 and 8.1 mg/g dry weight,
   respectively. The residual biomass from phycobiliproteins extraction was
   then used to produce biogas, with final methane yields ranging from 159
   to 199 mL CH4/g VS. According to the results, by combining the
   extraction of pigments and the production of biogas from residual
   biomass, we would not only obtain high-value compounds, but also more
   energy (around 5-10% higher), as compared to the single recovery of
   biogas. The proposed process poses an example of resource recovery from
   biomass grown in wastewater, moving toward a circular bioeconomy.

AB The industrialization of integrated algae-aquaculture systems entails

   Accordingly,Scenedesmus obliquuswas cultivated in a raceway pond (300
   m3), and the algal biomass was used as a protein source for the growth
   of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Nile tilapia fish was
   cultivated in five commercial-scale tanks for 44 weeks, having a
   productivity of 15-20 kg (live weight).m-3. Among various algal-based
   fish meals, the diet containing 7.5% microalgae provided the largest
   body length (29 cm) and weight (402 g), as well as the optimum growth
   performance parameters.Scenedesmus obliquuswas subjected to lipid
   extraction, and the defatted biomass was also used as a substitute for
   fishmeal in diets. Nile tilapia grown using the lipid-extracted algae
   had improved health status, and the biochemical composition was
   satisfactory. Further, two scenarios were economically investigated:Case
   1, the direct use of algal biomass for fish production, andCase 2, the
   utilization of algae for biodiesel production followed by the
   application of residual biomass in fishmeal diets. Based on field
   experiments and financial information reported in the literature, the
   two options would offset their initial investment cost within payback
   periods of 7.5 and 6.8 yr, respectively.

AB Biofuels have gained much attention in the recent years. Microalgae hold
   tremendous potential for production of biofuels as a suitable
   alternative to conventional fossil fuels. However, in order to ensure
   sustainability of the biofuel production from microalgae, many issues
   needs to be considered. Large-scale production of such biofuels is often
   limited by high cost of production, various environmental concerns
   including water footprint, and low yield. The algal biorefinery
   strategy, which can integrate several different conversion technologies
   to produce biofuels, holds potential for reducing the overall production
   cost. This paper is a review on various aspects associated with algal
   cultivation, lipid extraction and biodiesel production. Different
   factors reported to affect the process of algal cultivation and
   advancements in transesterification process and product recovery are
   summarized here. A brief on biorefinery approach is also discussed.

AB Sustainable and cost effective ways to produce renewable energy from
   biomass have generated considerable interest. Palm oil industries
   generates huge amount of waste. From one tonne of processed fresh fruit
   bunches (FFB), different types of wastes are generated which includes
   empty fruit bunch (EFB) (23%), mesocarp fiber (12%), shell (5%) and palm
   oil mill effluent (POME) (60%). POME has a high chemical and biochemical
   oxygen demand and mineral content such as nitrogen and phosphorous which
   can cause severe pollution to the environment. This can be a great
   nutrient for algal cultivation whilst remediating effluent and
   generating biomethane through anaerobic digestion. Algae capable of
   producing lipids and hydrocarbons with their photosynthetic abilities
   are among potential candidates for bioenergy generation. The harvested
   microalgal biomass can be used to produce bioethanol through
   fermentation. An integrated wastewater treatment and renewable bioenergy
   production would be an added benefit to the oil palm industry. This
   review discusses several potential strategies for tackling the
   environmental problems generated by POME together with renewable
   energies production, such as biomethane and biohydrogen. In addition,
   the prospects and technologies for commercialization of those renewable
   energies are discussed in detail. Apart from that, co-cultivation of
   microalgae using POME for biodiesel, bioethanol and biomethane
   production together with wastewater treatments are suggested as a new
   process for the enhancement renewable energies generation from oil palm
   mills. This unrealistic approach will ultimately become an essential
   standard reference for scientists, oil palm millers and government
   stakeholders.

   Marine-based biorefinery has been recently discussed as a promising
   route to mitigate the environmental challenges, enhance the energy
   recovery, and provide a potential source for value-added products.
   Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology that can convert the
   organic compounds of marine ecosystems into biogas. To date, a
   comprehensive review incorporating integrated biogas potential and
   effective approaches to enhance seaweed digestibility for biogas
   production from marine resources has not been reported. Thus, the
   present review aims to explore and comprehensively present seaweed and
   other marine resources for potential biogas production. The basics and
   challenges of biogas production from seaweed are elucidated. The impact
   of biochemical composition on biogas and the microbial communities
   involved in anaerobic digestion of seaweed are discussed. Utilization of
   different techniques such as pretreatment, co-digestion, and sequential
   extraction of seaweed biomass to enhance the biogas yield and to
   mitigate the effect of inhibitors are presented. Specifically, this
   article evaluates the co-digestion of seaweed with other biomass
   feedstocks or liquid biowastes. Integration of marine microalgae
   cultivation on anaerobic digestate for value-added compound production,
   biogas upgrading, and bioenergy recovery provides a promising approach
   towards a zero-waste marine-based system.

AB Cyanobacteria and algae having complex photosynthetic systems can
   channelize absorbed solar energy into other forms of energy for
   production of food and metabolites. In addition, they are promising
   biocatalysts and can be used in the field of "white biotechnology" for
   enhancing the sustainable production of food, metabolites, and green
   energy sources such as biodiesel. In this review, an endeavor has been
   made to uncover the significance of various metabolites like phenolics,
   phytoene/terpenoids, phytols, sterols, free fatty acids, photoprotective
   compounds (MAAs, scytonemin, carotenoids, polysaccharides, halogenated
   compounds, etc.), phytohormones, cyanotoxins, biocides (algaecides,
   herbicides, and insecticides) etc. Apart from this, the importance of
   these metabolites as antibiotics, immunosuppressant, anticancer,
   antiviral, anti-inflammatory agent has also been discussed. Metabolites
   obtained from cyanobacteria and algae have several biotechnological,
   industrial, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic uses which have also been
   discussed in this review along with the emerging technology of their
   harvesting for enhancing the production of compounds like bioethanol,
   biofuel etc. at commercial level. In later sections, we have discussed
   genetically modified organisms and metabolite production from them. We
   have also briefly discussed the concept of bioprocessing highlighting
   the functioning of companies engaged in metabolites production as well
   as their cost effectiveness and challenges that are being addressed by
   these companies.

AB Discharge of untreated or partially treated toxic dyes containing
   wastewater from textile industries into water streams is hazardous for
   environment. The use of heavy metal(s) rich dyes, which are chemically
   active in azo and sulfur content(s) has been tremendously increasing in
   last two decades. Conventional physical and chemical treatment processes
   help to eliminate the dyes from textile wastewater but generates the
   secondary pollutants which create an additional environmental problem.
   Microalgae especially the diatoms are promising candidate for dye
   remediation from textile wastewater. Nanoporous diatoms frustules doped
   with nanocomposites increase the wastewater remediation efficiency due
   to their adsorption properties. On the other hand, microalgae with
   photosynthetic microbial fuel cell have shown significant results in
   being efficient, cost effective and suitable for large scale
   phycoremediation. This integrated system has also capability to enhance
   lipid and carotenoids biosynthesis in microalgae while simultaneously
   generating the bioelectricity. The present review highlights the textile
   industry wastewater treatment by live and dead diatoms as well as
   microalgae such as Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Desmodesmus sp. etc. This
   review engrosses applicability of diatoms and microalgae as an
   alternative way of conventional dye removal techniques with
   techno-economic aspects.

AB Microalgae has emerged as promising feedstock for production of
   biodiesel compared to other vegetative resources primarily because of
   their high photosynthetic ability, high lipid content as well as rapid
   growth. As an alternative fuel, biodiesel is very imperative for the
   sustainable development of mankind. The production of Biodiesel process
   is carried out through upstream and downstream processing to generate
   cellular biomass to produce fatty acids and lipids via
   transesterification reaction. In our present study,Chlorella vulgariswas
   grown autotrophically in BG-11 medium as a batch culture. After proper
   incubation of algae, harvesting, drying and extraction of lipid were
   carried out with the help of standard procedurei.e.Modified Bligh &
   Dyer's method. Extracted lipid was 28.5% and it was further converted
   into biodiesel with the help of base catalysed trans-esterification
   reaction. The identification and quantification of fatty acids was
   performed using gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The
   identified fatty acids were dominated by those with carbon chain of C16
   and C18;i.e.13-Docosenoic acid, Oleic acid, 13-Eicosenoic acid,
   Benzenepropanoic acid, Glycidyl oleate, 9-Octadecanoic acid and Erucic
   acid.

AB In the wake of global warming and rapid fossil fuel depletion,
   microalgae emerge as promising feedstocks for sustainable biofuel
   production. Nile red staining acts as a rapid diagnostic tool to measure
   the amount of biodiesel-convertible lipid that the cells accumulate.
   There is a need for the development of a more uniform staining
   procedure. In its first phase, this study examined the dependence of
   microalgal Nile red fluorescence (Tetraselmis suecica) in terms of its
   most pertinent staining variables. A quadratic surface model that
   successfully described the Nile red fluorescence intensity as a
   composite function of its variables was generated (r2=0.86). Cell
   concentration was shown to have a significant effect on the fluorescence
   intensity. Up to a certain threshold, fluorescence intensity was shown
   to increase with Nile red dye concentration. In its second phase, the
   study reviewed findings from previous Nile red studies to elucidate some
   of the fundamental mechanism underlying the diffusion of Nile red dye
   molecules into the microalgal cells and their subsequent interaction
   with intracellular lipids. Through the review process, we were able to
   develop a simple framework that provided a set of guidelines for the
   standardization of the Nile red staining procedure across different
   microalgal species.

SO Bioresource Technology
VL 424
PY 2025
U1 1
U2 1
AB The production of biodiesel using microalgae has emerged as a promising
   alternative to fossil fuel-derived energy. However, microalgae-based
   biodiesel still faces challenges in achieving commercial economic
   feasibility. One of the primary reasons for this challenge is the
   limited extraction yield of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), which are
   essential for biodiesel synthesis. This study explores an easily
   accessible ozone-based extraction method to maximize LCFAs yields to
   address limitations. The experiments were conducted using Chlorella
   vulgaris, and the extraction efficiency was assessed for single ozone
   treatment and the combination of ozone treatment with physical
   (ultrasound) and chemical (pH adjustment) methods. The results indicated
   that LCFAs yield (33.12 mg/g) was achieved at 5 mg/L ozone concentration
   for 15 min at neutral pH, which was 3.41 times higher than that of the
   control (9.71 mg/g). Furthermore, combining ozone treatment with 100 W
   of ultrasound further enhanced the LCFAs yield to 52.32 mg/g,
   demonstrating a synergistic effect between ozone and physical treatment.
   The mechanism behind the increased extraction efficiency was attributed
   to the weakening of the cell wall, which facilitated LCFAs extraction.
   Additionally, it was observed that endogenous lipid synthesis was
   enhanced when the antioxidant 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP) was
   promoted in response to oxidative stress. The extracted LCFAs in this
   study were mainly saturated fatty acids, namely palmitic acid (C16:0)
   and stearic acid (C18:0). This study offers insights into optimizing
   ozone-based LCFA extraction as a scalable, eco-friendly method for
   microalgal biodiesel production, emphasizing its potential to reduce
   carbon dioxide emissions and support carbon-neutral energy solutions.

AB Spirulina platensis, when grown under stress, may alter its metabolic
   pathways, leading to carbohydrate accumulation. Research on the combined
   effects of stress factors such as UV radiation, photoperiod, and light,
   and the influence of micronutrients (Ca, Fe, and Mg) on microalgae
   carbohydrate composition is scarce. The aim of the present study was to
   evaluate the effects of combined cell stress factors on the microalgal
   growth and biochemical composition ofS. platensis, to apply the biomass
   in the context of biorefineries. Assays were performed at two
   cultivation stages: in the first stage, Zarrouk medium (50%) was used
   until the end of the exponential growth phase (18 days) and, in the
   second stage, the cells obtained in the first stage were centrifuged and
   recultivated in 20% Zarrouk's medium under physical (UV,
   photoperiod/light, NaCl) and nutritional stress (limitation of Ca, Fe,
   and Mg concentrations in 20% Zarrouk). The highest carbohydrate yields
   (27.84 mg L-1day-1) were obtained in the photoperiod/light
   intensity-stressed cultures in the medium with nutrient limitation. The
   study outcomes showed the methods to increase carbohydrate synthesis in
   cultures under optimized conditions. Our results showed that nutrient
   limitation by 20% Zarrouk combined with higher light intensity (67.5 mol
   photons m-2s-1) and photoperiod (18-h/6-h light/dark cycles) is an
   efficient strategy to achieve higher intracellular concentrations
   (59.71%) and carbohydrate yields (55.85 mg L-1day-1) in a discontinuous
   culture method.

AB Microalgae as a renewable and alternative energy feedstock have come
   under increased research interest, in response to the energy crisis,
   global warming and climate changes. Microalgal growth needs large
   amounts of chemical or organic fertilizers, causing substantial costs
   and risking the environment due to nutrient release. Using nutrient-rich
   wastewaters to cultivate microalgae appears a promising choice for the
   removal of nutrients and production of biofuels. Meanwhile, livestock
   production is rapidly increasing, especially in developing countries,
   because of increased consumption demands for meat. As a result, large
   quantities of animal wastes are left over, threatening environmental
   hygiene and becoming a barrier for development if not disposed of
   appropriately. Hence, the efforts to seek for an effective way to manage
   livestock wastes are also extremely important. This paper evaluates the
   feasibility of microalgal cultivation with livestock waste compost for
   continuous production of multiple bioproducts such as high values,
   biodiesel and biogas. A feasibility framework is proposed to fulfill
   this target. System integration and engineering is highlighted and main
   challenges are also discussed. Through careful microalgal biorefinery,
   the improvement of the economics of microalgal biofuels can be
   potentially achieved. Applying livestock waste compost to cultivate
   microalgae appears as a sustainable solution to realize both livestock
   waste management and bioproducts recovery, thus driving the industry
   towards sustainable growth.

U1 8
U2 182
AB Microalgae biorefineries for the production of biofuels and high-value
   products have captured the attention of academia and industry.
   Implementing an anaerobic digestion step can enhance resource recovery
   from microalgae and microalgae residues. Anaerobic co-digestion, the
   simultaneous digestion of two or more substrates, is an opportunity to
   overcome the low biodegradability and the risk of ammonia inhibition
   associated with microalgae and microalgae residues mono-digestion.
   Besides, microalgae can also be used as co-substrate in biogas plants,
   with the aim of increasing the organic loading rate while providing
   alkalinity, macro- and micronutrients. Sewage sludge is the most
   researched co-substrate for microalgae since microalgae photobioreactors
   can be used for secondary, tertiary and anaerobic digestion supernatant
   treatment in wastewater treatment plants. However, microalgae and
   microalgae residues have been successfully co-digested with a wide
   variety of wastes, including crops, energy crops, paper waste, animal
   manure, vinasse, olive mill waste, and fat, oil and grease. Lipid-spent
   microalgae and glycerol co-digestion has also been largely researched
   due to the growing interest on microalgal-derived biodiesel. Most
   studies have assessed the impact of co-digestion on the methane yield
   and process kinetics through biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests.
   However, BMP test is not the most suitable method to assess the impact
   of co-digestion on other important factors such as supernatant nutrient
   content, digestate dewaterability, biosolids quality, and H2S
   concentration in the biogas. Overall, more lab-scale and pilot-scale
   continuous experiments are needed to get a holistic understanding of
   microalgal anaerobic co-digestion.

U1 2
U2 40
AB Microalgae are a possible source of biofuel, but no commercial
   development has yet been developed. Possible approaches to improve
   economic feasibility involve increasing lipid content and the usage of
   biorefinery in microalgae. In this regard, the
   nitrogen-deficient-synthetic wastewater was fed to four microalgae to
   increase the lipid and carbohydrate content. In conjunction, changes in
   the amount of biorefinery components, including proteins and pigments,
   during nitrogen synthetic wastewater feeding have also been reported.
   The study revealed that both lipids and carbohydrates increased as much
   as 2 and 1.5 times in selected microalgae after 20 days of
   nitrogen-deficient-synthetic wastewater relative to nitrogen sufficient
   conditions, respectively. In particular, after 20 days of exposure to
   nitrogen deficient synthetic wastewater, the highest Lipid content of
   40% was displayed by Desmodesmus sp. The same species had also shown an
   increased carbohydrate content of 18.3%. Carotenoids was retained in
   Desmodemsus sp. (0.03%) through nitrogen deficiency, but were shown to
   be reduced in three other algae. Analysis of the FAME profile of four
   nitrogen-deficient microalgae indicated that lipid was promising for
   biodiesel production as it showed an increase in saturated fatty acid
   content and a decrease in unsaturated fatty acid content. However,
   during nitrogen insufficiency, unavoidable side reactions involving
   reductions in protein levels, chlorophylls (a and b type) and biomass
   were observed in all four microalgae. But 23.3% protein was found in
   Desmodesmus sp. at end of 20th day of nitrogen deprivation The study
   showed that feeding of nitrogen-deficient-synthetic wastewater raised
   the lipid and carbohydrate content and maintained carotenoids in
   selected microalgae. Above said approach is possibly a low cost
   economical option for biorefinery.

AB Algal biomass is regarded as a sustainable energy feedstock for the
   future. Enhancement of the biomass and metabolite production of
   microalgae increases the economic feasibility of the biofuel production
   process. The present study encompasses on bioethanol production from
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through a biorefinery approach. The biomass
   and carbohydrate productivity of C. reinhardtii UTEX 90 and CC 2656 were
   enhanced by optimizing the physico-chemical parameters. The following
   conditions were found suitable for the improvement of biomass and
   metabolite content of C. reinhardtii: pH 6.5-7.0, incubation temperature
   30°C, initial acetate and ammonium chloride concentration of 1.56 g L-1
   and 100-200 mg L-1, respectively. Under the optimized operational
   condition biomass and carbohydrate productivity of C. reinhardtii UTEX
   90 and CC 2656 were 512 mg L-1 d-1 & 266.24 mg L-1 d-1 and 364 mg L-1 d
   -1 & 163.80 mg L-1 d-1, respectively. The amount of CO2 sequestered
   during the cultivation process by UTEX 90 and CC 2656 were 113 mg L-1
   d-1 and 74.95 mg L-1 d-1, respectively. The depigmented and defatted
   carbohydrate rich biomass was considered as raw material for bioethanol
   production. The bioethanol yield range was 90-94% of the theoretical
   yield using Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSC-1 in a double jacket reactor.
   To improve the viability of the process, the spent media after ethanol
   fermentation was subsequently used for methane production using mixed
   microbial consortium. The energy recovery from the process was 40.39%
   and 39.7% for UTEX 90 and CC 2656, respectively when C. reinhardtii
   biomass was used as substrate for biofuel production. The present
   investigation concedes with the potentiality of algae as a favourable
   3rd generation feedstock to address the existing challenges of clean
   energy production with concomitant CO2 sequestration.

AB With their fast growth rate and ability to accumulate a high percentage
   of their weight as lipid and carbohydrate, microalgae potentially
   represent an ideal feedstock for the production of biodiesel and
   bioethanol. In addition, microalgae offer several environmental
   benefits, and do not compete with food production for land, fresh water,
   and nutrients. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to provide a
   quantitative, systematic and harmonized assessment of current bio-energy
   potential. The analysis is conducted by considering all the main steps
   in detail, from cultivation to biodiesel production, and by deriving an
   overall estimation of energy consumption for biodiesel production.
   Energy consumption uncertainty is also quantified and discussed. A
   systematic review of all the main technologies available for all the
   main processing steps towards the production of biodiesel from
   microalgae is presented, focusing on the derivation of the Net Energy
   Ratio (NER) of each combination of technologies, complemented by an
   uncertainty analysis of the data used and those obtained in the present
   work. A wide scatter in the data available in the literature has been
   identified, highlighting the need for an uncertainty analysis. If the
   average overall energy consumption per unit of biodiesel mass is
   considered, all the routes adopting a raceway pond have a lower energy
   consumption, but if the uncertainty on the overall energy consumption is
   also considered, the minimum value of the range of NER values for some
   of the routes adopting a photobioreactor is comparable to the NER value
   obtainable by using raceway ponds. Thus, the present framework proposes
   a harmonized and comprehensive methodology to compare and contrast
   technologies for the production of biodiesel from microalgae, and is
   applied in this paper to identify, with an appreciation of the
   uncertainty, the most promising combinations of technologies.

AB Photosynthetic green microalgae are eukaryotic microorganisms that can

   additional value from the biomass left after lipid extraction has the
   potential to help make the overall process more cost-effective. This
   review focuses on these additional value-added options that obtain and
   utilize either whole lipid-extracted biomass (LEB), which typically
   constitutes 60%-70% of total cell mass, or specific non-biodiesel lipid
   components such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, and

AB A comparison of different inorganic and organic flocculants at doses of
   50, 100 and 200 mg/L was performed to achieve the maximum biomass
   harvesting of Nannochloropsis gaditana microalgae. The best results were
   reached by aluminium chloride with 90.9  0.2% biomass recovered followed
   by copper sulphate with 70.8  0.3% at the maximum doses used. If the
   behaviour is analysed after spending 24 h, all flocculants recovered
   more than 90% algal biomass. In the oil extraction process, a maximum of
   29.25  1.10% extracted oil was achieved by Soxhlet using
   methanol-chloroform 2:1 as solvent and applying previous disruption by
   microwave. 20.4% less oil was released when n-hexane was used.
   Ultrasound extraction assisted by microwave reached peak values of 22.60
   1.03%. Methyl esters of saturated fatty acids (C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0)
   were found as the major constituents, accounting for about 70% of the
   total content. Direct transesterification with previous incubation
   accomplished higher biodiesel conversions than without it. Finally,
   pellet manufacturing from algal wastes obtained after the
   transesterification reaction was studied. The results indicated that
   these pellet should be mixed with another type of biomass (e.g.,
   miscanthus or eucalyptus) to be used as fuel in biomass boilers.

AB Emergence of pollutants in wastewater, expensive cultivation of
   microalgae, and difficulties in industrial scale production are the main
   challenges for successful coupling of microalgae with wastewater.
   Nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus in wastewater are deliberately consumed
   by microalgae and cyanobacteria for their growth and could act as green
   technology for wastewater treatment. In this review, the role and
   mechanistic approaches of microalgae and cyanobacteria for removal of
   various (in)organic compounds from wastewater have been thoroughly
   addressed. Distinct pathways have been reported for improving wastewater
   treatment technologies through large-scale cultivation of microalgal.
   The techno-economic feasibility and major commercial production
   challenges along with genetic engineering research have been addressed.
   A biorefinery approach with integrated biology, ecology, and engineering
   would lead to a feasible microalgal-based technology for various
   applications.

U1 3
U2 70
AB Cost-efficient harvesting of microalgae is a major challenge due to
   their small size and often low concentration in the culture medium. The
   flocculation efficacy of different inorganic and organic amendments was
   evaluated on various microalgae genera - one strain each belonging
   toChlamydomonas,Chlorococcum, two ofBotryococcus, and ofChlorella. An
   improvised medium comprising of commercial grade urea, single super
   phosphate, and muriate of potash was used to grow the microalgae for
   flocculation experiments. High pH induced increased flocculation
   efficiency (72-76%) in selected microalgal strains. Ferric chloride was
   found to be the most efficient for most of the microalgal strains, while
   maize starch and rice starch proved superior forChlorellasp. MCC6
   andBotryococcussp. MCC32. Although the highest flocculation efficiency
   was obtained with inorganic flocculant, i.e., ferric chloride (87.3%)
   withBotryococcusMCC31, this was comparable with rice starch (86.8%)
   forBotryococcusMCC32. This study showed that widely available cheaper
   biopolymers such as rice starch, maize, and potato starch can be
   promising flocculants due to their better harvesting efficiency (>80%)
   and low price, thereby contributing to economical production of
   biodiesel from algae.

U1 13
U2 64
AB Microalgae have received much interest as a biofuel feedstock. However,
   the economic feasibility of biofuel production from microalgae does not
   satisfy capital investors. Apart from the biofuels, it is necessary to
   produce high-value co-products from microalgae fraction to satisfy the
   economic aspects of microalgae biorefinery. In addition,
   microalgae-based wastewater treatment is considered as an alternative
   for the conventional wastewater treatment in terms of energy
   consumption, which is suitable for microalgae biorefinery approaches.
   The energy consumption of a microalgae wastewater treatment system (0.2
   kW/h/m3) was reduced 10 times when compared to the conventional
   wastewater treatment system (to 2 kW/h/m3). Microalgae are rich in
   various biomolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, pigments,
   vitamins, and antioxidants; all these valuable products can be utilized
   by nutritional, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. There are
   several bottlenecks associated with microalgae biorefinery. Hence, it is
   essential to promote the sustainability of microalgal biorefinery with
   innovative ideas to produce biofuel with high-value products. This
   review attempted to bring out the trends and promising solutions to
   realize microalgal production of multiple products at an industrial
   scale. New perspectives and current challenges are discussed for the
   development of algal biorefinery concepts.

AB The low grade of biogas and the difficulty of treating biogas slurry are
   the two major bottlenecks limiting the sustainable development of the
   fermentation engineering. This study investigates the potential role of
   microalgae-microbial symbiosis and phytohormones in solving this
   challenge.Chlorellamicroalgae were combined with endophytic bacteria
   (S395-2) andClonostachysfungus to construct symbiotic systems. Growth,
   photosynthetic activity, and carbon dioxide and pollutant removal out of
   biogas slurry and biogas were analyzed under treatment with three
   different phytohormones (cytokinin, synthetic strigolactones (GR24),
   natural strigolactones). TheChlorella-S395-2-Clonostachyssymbiont
   achieved the highest purification efficiency under GR24 induction, with
   removal efficiency exceeding 86% for chemical oxygen demand, total
   phosphorous, and total nitrogen, as well as over 76% for CO2. Economic
   efficiency can be increased by about 150%. The positive correlation
   between treatment effectiveness and co-culture performance suggests a
   promising avenue for developing symbiotic systems for biogas slurry
   treatment and biogas upgrading.

AB Biohydrogen (bio-H2) is regarded as a clean, non-toxic, energy carrier
   and has enormous potential for transforming fossil fuel-based economy.
   The development of a continuous high-rate H2production with low-cost
   economics following an environmentally friendly approach should be
   admired for technology demonstration. Thus, the current review discusses
   the biotechnological and thermochemical pathways for H2production.
   Thermochemical conversion involves pyrolysis and gasification routes,
   while biotechnological involves light-dependent processes (e.g., direct
   and indirect photolysis, photo/ dark fermentation strategies). Moreover,
   environmentally friendly technologies can be created while utilizing
   renewable energy sources including lignocellulosic, wastewater, sludge,
   microalgae, and others, which are still being developed. Lifecycle
   assessment (LCA) evaluates and integrates the economic, environmental,
   and social performance of H2production from biomass, microalgae, and
   biochar. Moreover, system boundaries evaluation, i.e., global warming
   potential, acidification, eutrophication, and sensitivity analysis could
   lead in development of sustainable bioenergy transition with high
   economic and environmental benefits.

AB Global warming issue due to the combustion of fossil fuel pushes the
   world to produce renewable and environmental friendly fuel from
   sustainable feedstock. There are several measures on different levels to
   reduce the global warming including clean energies from wind, solar, and
   biomass. There are different aspects in bringing these technologies into
   a reality including development of technology, economic feasibilities,
   environmental sustainability and finally, support from the government in
   the form of effective policies and public awareness. Adequate R&D
   efforts could overcome all the factors but only an effective policy
   could drive those efforts to reality. Therefore, in this connection this
   review initially addresses the present state of energy demand,
   progression of biofuel sources and the bottlenecks in microalgal biofuel
   production and commercialization. The biofuel policies are essential to
   change the world's dependence on fossil fuels for a better tomorrow.
   Hence, this review addresses the salient features of National Biofuel
   Policy of India that helps in regulating the biofuels production and
   their marketing. As a part of Policy implementation, government of India
   introduced several schemes and programs in last two-decades, which
   includes mandate blending of ethanol with gasoline, diesel with
   biodiesel, for the future clean energy vision, and incentivizing
   bio-based products/fuels. In addition, participation of both federal and
   state governments for clean energy initiatives, capital investments and
   tax credits were described in detail. Many policies lack easy outreach
   among public and industries, which needs marketing by the government
   that secures a clean energy future in India. Though India is in the
   process of evolution, it might be quite difficult to enact a dedicative
   legislation to deal with the challenges of biofuel marketing. Therefore,
   recent initiatives and scope were summarized in this review for future
   endeavours.

AB The use of renewable energy sources as a substitute for nonrenewable
   fossil fuels is urgently required. Algae biorefinery platform provides
   an excellent alternate to overcome future energy problems. However, to
   let this viable biomass be competent with existing feedstocks, it is
   necessary to exploit genetic manipulation and improvement in upstream
   and downstream platforms for optimal bio-product recovery. Furthermore,
   the techno-economic strategies further maximize metabolites production
   for biofuel, biohydrogen, and other industrial applications. The
   experimental methodologies in algal photobioreactor promote high biomass
   production, enriched in lipid and starch content in limited
   environmental conditions. This review presents an optimization framework
   combining genetic manipulation methods to simulate microalgal growth
   dynamics, understand the complexity of algal biorefinery to scale up,
   and identify green strategies for techno-economic feasibility of algae
   for biomass conversion. Overall, the algal biorefinery opens up new
   possibilities for the valorization of algae biomass and the synthesis of
   various novel products.

AB The rapid rise in global population and increase in food demands have
   significantly propelled mass production of plant- and animal-based
   conventional foods, which require substantial arable lands, water, and
   time. Microalgae have the potential to be a sustainable and promising
   alternative sources of nutrient-rich food supplement, amongst
   whichNannochloropsisis highlighted by its high concentration of nutrient
   rich metabolites. Most significantly, ~30-40% of lipids synthesized
   byNannochloropsisconstitute polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), in which
   20-30% of total fatty acids account for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an
   essential omega-3 supplement required for human health. Nevertheless,
   the incorporation of whole biomass ofNannochloropsisinto functional
   foods often imparts negative tastes and odor. Therefore, EPA could be
   extracted by utilizing green, sustainable methods, including microwave
   and ultrasound pretreatment, supercritical fluid extraction, green
   solvents, and purified through urea complexation. Moreover, the defatted
   residual biomass could be valorized to various co-products, namely
   biofuels, sugars, and proteins, within a zero-waste biorefinery model.
   Amongst the multitude of biorefinery routes available, processes
   starting with high value EPA extraction followed by synthesis of
   peptides from a protein-rich residual biomass appear to be most
   lucrative. Hence, the current review provides a holistic outlook on
   large-scale production ofNannochloropsis-derived EPA by assessing
   various extraction and purification methods, and functional food
   applications, while scrutinizing the viability of biorefining for an
   economically viable and sustainable commercialization.

AB This report shows that pig manure can be used for algal production in
   small farms. Huge pig sludge amounts produced using actual methods in
   large-scale pig breeding farms is a major issue due to the lack of
   disposal options and potential water pollution. This issue may be solved
   by using pig sludge for algal biofuel production. Therefore, we studied
   an economical method of algae production on pig sludge that can be
   operated on animal farms in Hungary with modest levels of investment. We
   analyzed four algae species,Chlorella vulgaris,Scenedesmus
   quadricauda,Scenedesmus dimorphus, andArthrospira platensis, in the
   laboratory andC. vulgarisin outdoor conditions. The following parameters
   were studied: pot size, illumination, temperature, filtered versus
   unfiltered pig manure, water depth, aeration, CO2enrichment, inoculums
   solution, fertilization level, and length of rotation period. Produced
   alga biomass was measured every 4 days, and the protein- and lipid
   content was analyzed using the method of Bradford (1976) and Erickson
   (1993). Our results show first that the unfiltered pig manure is not
   suitable for algae production due to illumination shortage. By contrast,
   using filtered pig manure, we found thatC. vulgarisyield in 70-l indoor
   pots was 64% higher than in smaller pots. In a larger outdoor system,
   the annual dry yield ofC. vulgarisreached 141-259 t/ha during
   12-day-long rotation periods. Here, we demonstrate that only filtered
   liquid pig manure can be recommended for algae production.C. vulgarisis
   the most suitable alga species for use in large-scale experiments on pig
   sludge. Based on our outdoor experiments, the adaptation of a 12- to
   14-day rotation period could be considered the most reasonable. An algae
   farm can therefore be operated with relative modest amount of capital,
   can hence address the issue of sludge management, and provide a
   substrate for energy production.

AB Over the last decades, microalgal biomass has gained a significant role
   in the development of different high-end (nutraceuticals, colorants,
   food supplements, and pharmaceuticals) and low-end products (biodiesel,
   bioethanol, and biogas) due to its rapid growth and high carbon-fixing
   efficiency. Therefore, microalgae are considered a useful and
   sustainable resource to attain energy security while reducing our
   current reliance on fossil fuels. From the technologies available for
   obtaining biofuels using microalgae biomass, thermochemical processes
   (pyrolysis, Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL), gasification) have proven
   to be processed with higher viability, because they use all biomass.
   However, due to the complex structure of the biomass (lipids,
   carbohydrates, and proteins), the obtained biofuels from direct
   thermochemical conversion have large amounts of heteroatoms (oxygen,
   nitrogen, and sulfur). As a solution, catalyst-based processes have
   emerged as a sustainable solution for the increase in biocrude
   production. This paper's objective is to present a comprehensive review
   of recent developments on the catalyst-mediated conversion of algal
   biomass. Special attention will be given to operating conditions,
   strains evaluated, and challenges for the optimal yield of algal-based
   biofuels through pyrolysis and HTL.

AB The potential for biodiesel production from microalgal lipids and for
   CO2 mitigation due to photoautotrophic growth of microalgae have
   recently been recognized. Microalgae biomass also has other valuable
   components, including carbohydrates, long chain fatty acids, pigments
   and proteins. The microalgae-based carbohydrates consist mainly of
   cellulose and starch without lignin; thus they can be ready carbon
   source for the fermentation industry. Some microalgae can produce long
   chain fatty acids (such as DHA and EPA) as valuable health food
   supplements. In addition, microalgal pigments and proteins have
   considerable potential for many medical applications. This review
   article presents comprehensive information on the current state of these
   commercial applications, as well as the utilization and characteristics
   of the microalgal components, in addition to the key factors and
   challenges that should be addressed during the production of these
   materials, and thus provides a useful report that can aid the
   development of an efficient microalgae-based biorefinery process.

   productivities of mixotrophic algal cells exceed the combination of
   autotrophic and heterotrophic cells when acetate was adopted as the

   culture (130 mg L-1 day-1) is 1.9 times greater than the combination of
   autotrophic (15 mg L-1 day-1) and heterotrophic (51 mg L-1 day-1)
   cultures. C18:1 is the predominant fatty acid accounting for 60.4 and

   (TCA) cycle is improved in mixotrophic culture when compared with
   heterotrophic culture, leading to more fatty acid synthesis in C.
   vulgaris.

AB In this study, Desmodesmus pannonicus IITISM-DIX2, outperforming
   Chlorella sorokiniana IITISM-DIX3 in caffeine degradation, was used to
   develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting caffeine
   removal efficiency under varying pH, photoperiods, caffeine, and indole
   acetic acid (IAA) concentrations. The ANN model, designed with a 4-15-1
   multilayer perceptron and trained on 120 data points, achieved high
   predictive accuracy (R2 > 0.96) and bias/accuracy factors between
   0.95-1.11. Sensitivity analysis identified pH as the most critical
   factor. IAA enhanced lipid content in Desmodesmus by 91% in
   caffeine-containing simulated wastewater. FAME analysis was performed
   under optimal lipid-producing conditions (10 ppm caffeine, 5 ppm IAA).
   IAA upregulated key metabolic pathways, increasing secondary metabolites
   in Desmodesmus and Chlorella. In summary, the modeling results are key
   for improving system performance, guiding parameter selection to enhance
   caffeine removal by Desmodesmus. IAA also enhanced resilience and lipid
   yield, increasing the economic feasibility of caffeine removal and
   biofuel production.

   Effect of iron on growth and lipid accumulation in marine microalgae
   Chlorella vulgaris were investigated. In experiment I, supplementing the
   growth media with chelated FeCl3 in the late growth phase increased the
   final cell density but did not induce lipid accumulation in cells. In
   experiment II, cells in the late-exponential growth phase were collected
   by centrifugation and re-inoculated into new media supplemented with
   five levels of Fe3+ concentration. Total lipid content in cultures
   supplemented with 1.2*10-5 mol L-1 FeCl3 was up to 56.6% biomass by dry
   weight and was 3-7-fold that in other media supplemented with lower iron
   concentration. Moreover, a simple and rapid method determining the lipid
   accumulation in C. vulgaris with spectrofluorimetry was developed.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sodium nitrate
   (NaNO3) limitation on cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 growth in
   order to increase its lipid content. The results revealed that the
   nitrate limitation conditions increase the volumetric biomass
   productivity, reaching the maximum content at 0.75 g/L NaNO3 (0.043
   g/L.day). The maximum chlorophyll a and b concentrations were 6.42
   mug/mL (0.75 g/L NaNO3) and 0.63 mug/mL (1.25 g/L NaNO3), respectively
   for Synechocystis PCC 6803, cultured in week 9. Also, Synechocystis PCC
   6803 exhibited a decrease of protein content and an increase of lipid
   content with the decrease of NaNO3 concentration. The obtained results
   suggested that a concentration of 0.75 g/L NaNO3 in the Synechocystis
   PCC 680 growth medium resulted in the highest lipid content (21.3%),
   making it a potential feedstock for biodiesel production.

AB There is wide consensus that Spirulina can serve as a tool for
   wastewater management and simultaneously provide feedstock for
   biorefining. However, the economic aspects associated with its use
   remain a significant challenge. Spirulina cultivated in wastewater
   decreased the concentrations of both ammonia and nitrate and also served
   as a biodiesel source. The oil obtained in the feedstock was subjected
   to transesterification and turned into biodiesel. The biodiesel was
   subsequently analyzed in a test motor (water-cooled, four-stroke,
   single-cylinder compression ignition with injection). The tests were
   conducted at a constant 1500 rpm, and the output power was 3.7 kW.
   Mixtures of diesel and biodiesel were also enriched with carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs). The amount of CNTs added to the diesel was 30 mg L-1.
   The algae and de-oiled biomass were characterized using XRD analysis,
   and an ultrasonicator was used to mix the CNTs with diesel and spirulina
   blends. A series of tests were conducted at different load conditions
   (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for all fuel blends. Test results were
   compared with a neat diesel engine with a CR of 17.5:1. Among the fuel
   blends, the B25 reported improved brake thermal efficiency and reduced
   emissions. The outcomes are a reduction in thermal efficiency of 0.98%
   and exhaust gas temperature of 1.7%. The addition of Spirulina biodiesel
   blends had a positive impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas
   emissions, including reductions of 16.3%, 3.6%, 6.8%, and 12.35% of CO,
   NOx, and smoke, respectively. The specific fuel consumption and CO2
   emissions were reduced by 5.2% and 2.8%, respectively, for B25 fuel
   blends compared to plain diesel and B50. Concerning cost
   competitiveness, vigorous research on microalgae for the production of
   biodiesel can cut production costs in the future.

   microalgal protein recovery and separation by utilizing a one-step or
   integrated downstream process. This in turn enables green biorefinery of
   protein, contributing to circular bioeconomy whereby less energy, labor,
   and cost are required for the process. By utilizing electric three phase
   partitioning flotation system, high protein recovery yield, R of 99.42 
   0.52% and high separation efficiency, E of 52.72  0.40% system was
   developed. Scaling up also showed high protein recovery yield with R
   value of 89.13  1.56%. Total processing duration (extraction,
   separation, and purification) was also significantly reduced to 10 min.
   This system showed remarkable potential in reducing processing time,
   alternatively cost of production, benefiting microalgal downstream
   processing. Concisely, through this system, microalgal bioprocessing
   will no longer be complex allowing a wide array of potentials for

AB Outbreaks of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms present a serious
   threat to ecosystem safety and human well-being. Removal of toxic
   cyanobacterial biomass from freshwaters and its safe utilization is a
   worldwide problem. We showed that regulation of intracellular carbon
   flow by applying nitrogen deprivation strategy with light and inorganic
   carbon manipulation during the cultivation of cyanobacterium Microcystis
   allows efficiently convert its biomass into the biofuel feedstock. The
   proteomic analysis demonstrated that highly efficient feedstock
   production can be achieved during Microcystis culturing by nitrogen
   deprivation, which slows down the catabolic consumption of carbohydrates
   in cells. Further, we developed a novel approach that allows converting
   the natural Microcystis biomass into carbohydrate-rich feedstock by
   maintaining a high rate of carbohydrate production at minimal biomass
   losses. The yield attains 0.22 g ethanol per gram dry biomass, which is
   in the range of the ethanol yield of sugarcane, but higher than the
   values of sugarcane waste. The suggested approach provides
   cost-effective technology for sustainable green energy production from
   nuisance cyanobacterial biomass. The massive removal of toxic
   cyanobacterial biomass for bioethanol productions can mitigate the
   harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes, and positively affect
   their restoration.

   regarding a variety of microalgae uses results in high interest among
   people in the world to harvest microalgae. Harvesting of commercial
   microalgae is normally done by centrifugation, gravity filtration,
   ultrafiltration and other methods which require high costs. Therefore,
   the harvesting ofChlorella spby bioflocculation method which involves
   autoflocculating microalgae,Scenedemus spwith lower cost was introduced.
   The removal efficiency >80% and biomass recovery >75% were achieved for
   coagulation-flocculation ofScenedesmus spto harvestChlorella sp. Results
   of this study showed that the utilization of auto-flocculate microalgae
   in microalgae biomass harvesting could abridge downstream processing,
   redeemable resources and would reduce the production cost for future

AB Microalgal biodiesel is considered as a carbon-neutral and renewable
   energy source for replacing/blending with petroleum-based diesel fuel.
   Selection of a microalgal species for its potential to produce biodiesel
   relies significantly on its acclimatization to grow in outdoor condition
   with high lipid productivity. The present investigation undertakes
   outdoor experiments in a raceway pond system involving a local isolate
   of green microalga, Chlorella minutissima, throughout varied seasonal
   changes and culture depth. The variations in climatic and cultural
   parameters were documented; the optimum culture depth of 30 cm was taken
   for further investigation. A novel cultivation approach incorporating
   the sequential addition of low-dose phosphate (LDSPA) projected a lipid
   productivity of 5.88 ton hectare-1 year-1, which was ~40% higher than
   its batch culture counterpart, along with a 14-fold reduction in
   phosphate application. The biodiesel exhibited the dominance of
   saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters, and the fuel
   qualities were confirmed to be within the stipulated limitations of
   European, American and Indian biodiesel standards, thus nominating C.
   minutissima as an attractive feedstock for generating high-quality
   biodiesel.

AB One of the main challenges for the successful production and use of
   microalgae for biodiesel production is to obtain a satisfactory level of
   fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The aims of this study are to identify
   the best method of lipid extraction and provide high FAME levels and to
   evaluate their fatty acid profiles. Six lipid extraction methodologies
   in three microalgae species were tested in comparison with the direct
   transesterification (DT) of microalgal biomass method. The choice of
   extraction method affected both the oily extract yield and the FAME
   composition of the microalgae and consequently may affect the properties
   of biodiesel. The efficiency of different lipid extraction methods is
   affected by the solvent polarity, which extracts different target
   compounds from lipid matrix. Dichloromethane/methanol extraction and
   Folch extraction produced the largest oil extract yields, but extraction
   with hexane/ethanol resulted in the best ester profile and levels.
   Performing DT reduces the volume of extractor solvent, the time and cost
   of FA composition analysis, as well as, presents less steps for fatty
   acid quantification. DT provided biomass FAME levels of 50.2, 636.4, and
   258.2 mg.g-1inNannochlorophisis oculata,Chaetoceros muelleri,
   andChlorellasp., respectively. On the basis of an analysis of the fatty

   for biodiesel production. Depending on the extraction
   method,Chlorellasp. andN. oculatacan be considered as an alternative in
   obtaining arachidonic (Aa) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids.

AB Microalgae biorefinery is a platform for the conversion of microalgal
   biomass into a variety of value-added products, such as biofuels,
   bio-based chemicals, biomaterials, and bioactive substances.
   Commercialization and industrialization of microalgae biorefinery
   heavily rely on the capability and efficiency of large-scale cultivation
   of microalgae. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel technologies that
   can be used to monitor, automatically control, and precisely predict
   microalgae production. In light of this, innovative applications of the
   Internet of things (IoT) technologies in microalgae biorefinery have
   attracted tremendous research efforts. IoT has potential applications in
   a microalgae biorefinery for the automatic control of microalgae
   cultivation, monitoring and manipulation of microalgal cultivation
   parameters, optimization of microalgae productivity, identification of
   toxic algae species, screening of target microalgae species,
   classification of microalgae species, and viability detection of
   microalgal cells. In this critical review, cutting-edge IoT technologies
   that could be adopted to microalgae biorefinery in the upstream and
   downstream processing are described comprehensively. The current
   advances of the integration of IoT with microalgae biorefinery are
   presented. What this review discussed includes automation, sensors,
   lab-on-chip, and machine learning, which are the main constituent
   elements and advanced technologies of IoT. Specifically, future research
   directions are discussed with special emphasis on the development of
   sensors, the application of microfluidic technology, robotized
   microalgae, high-throughput platforms, deep learning, and other
   innovative techniques. This review could contribute greatly to the
   novelty and relevance in the field of IoT-based microalgae biorefinery
   to develop smarter, safer, cleaner, greener, and economically efficient
   techniques for exhaustive energy recovery during the biorefinery
   process.

AB This study assessed the feasibility of unhydrolyzed cogongrass as a
   medium fortificant for cultivation ofChlorella vulgarisUMT-M1
   andScenedesmussp. KS-2. Nitrogen-limited media supplemented with
   0.1-0.5% (w/v) cogongrass leaf extract induced changes in lipid content
   and produced effects that appear to counteract the effects of nitrogen
   depletion, restoring lipid and fatty acid content to levels similar to
   nitrogen-replete media while biomass was decreased. While
   nitrogen-limited media led to an increase in total lipid, oleic acid
   (C18:1) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content and a decrease in
   palmitic acid (C16:0), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and saturated
   fatty acid (SFA) content, the presence of cogongrass extract evidently
   cancelled this effect. As a sole ingredient, cogongrass reduced biomass,
   C16:0, PUFA and SFA, but increased total oil, C18:1 and MUFA to levels
   similar to N-limited media. Unexpectedly, a 45.8% increase in lipid
   productivity inScenedesmussp. under N-limitation was observed, despite a
   reduction in biomass. This study demonstrates that the extract from
   cogongrass and likely from other plant sources could potentially be used
   as a medium fortificant for microalga cultivation for lipid production.
   It could also be used as part of a cultivation strategy towards the
   production of desired fatty acid composition for biodiesel applications.
   In addition, this study could spark new research for alternative medium
   fortificants for microalga cultivation from various unutilized or waste
   plant biomass resources.

   medium, resulting in biomass yields and fatty acids (FAs) content which
   varied between 570-1117 mg L-1 and 3.9-24.5%, respectively. The main FAs
   detected in the four species were oleic, palmitic and linolenic acid,
   with significant differences in their relative abundance. Concerning
   nutrients removal, almost complete NH3-N removal was observed, while% TP
   removal exceeded 80% for three of the four strains tested. Furthermore,
   induction kinetics of prompt chlorophyll fluorescence was used as a

AB The non-model microalgaMessastrum gracileSE-MC4 is a potential species
   for biodiesel production. However, low biomass productivity hinders it
   from passing the life cycle assessment for biodiesel production.
   Therefore, the current study was aimed at uncovering the differences in
   the transcriptome profiles of the microalgae at early exponential and
   early stationary growth phases and dissecting the roles of specific
   differential expressed genes (DEGs) involved in cell division duringM.
   gracilecultivation. The transcriptome analysis revealed that the
   photosynthetic integral membrane protein genes such as photosynthetic
   antenna protein were severely down-regulated during the stationary
   growth phase. In addition, the signaling pathways involving
   transcription, glyoxylate metabolism and carbon metabolism were also
   down-regulated during stationary growth phase. Current findings
   suggested that the coordination between photosynthetic integral membrane
   protein genes, signaling through transcription and carbon metabolism
   classified as prominent strategies during exponential growth stage.
   These findings can be applied in genetic improvement ofM. gracilefor
   biodiesel application.

AB The production of biofuel from microalgae has been an area of great
   interest as microalgae have higher productivities than land plants, and
   certain species have high lipid constituents which are the major
   feedstock for biodiesel production. One way to enhance the economic
   feasibility of algal-based biofuel is to couple it with waste
   remediation. This study investigated the technical feasibility of
   cultivatingChlorellasp. andNannochloropsissp. with fish water for
   biofuel production. The remediation potential ofChlorellasp. was found
   to be higher but the lipid yield is lower, when compared
   toNannochloropsissp. Lipid productivities were found to be similar for
   both types of algae at 1.1-1.3 mg L-1h-1. The fatty acid profiles of the
   obtained lipids were found suitable for biofuel production, and the
   calorific values were high at 30-32 MJ/kg. The results provide insights
   into lipid production inChlorellasp. andNannochloropsissp., when coupled
   with waste remediation.

AB This research aims to propose management strategies to mitigate

   Colombia. The information analyzed was provided by environmental
   authorities such as IDEAM, CORANTIOQUIA, and CORNARE in Antioquia, where
   the average concentrations of phosphorus in wastewater from municipal,
   livestock, and industrial activities are 5.1, 30.6, and 29.1 mg P/L. The
   total nitrogen concentrations are 77, 143, and 121 mg N/L, respectively,
   surpassing the limit concentrations stated by the European Union, the
   United States, and Mexico, among others, while Colombia has not
   established its own limits. Including limitations for nutrient
   concentrations will align Colombia with the 2050 Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs), where microalgae species like Chlorella or Scenedesmus
   could be used in wastewater treatment systems for municipalities and
   industries. These microalgae can capture organic matter, nutrients, and
   greenhouse emissions and reduce the concentrations observed in natural
   water. They could also be an alternative for capturing heavy metals and
   some pollutants of emerging concern. In addition to the ecological and
   social benefits, the algal biomass could be valorized by transforming it
   into biological products such as fuels, fertilizers, and pigments when
   micropollutants are not present, reducing operational costs for
   treatment systems.

AB Microalgae have been rising as a feedstock for biofuel in response to
   the energy crisis. Due to a high lipid content, composed of fatty acids
   favorable for the biodiesel production, microalgae are still being
   investigated as an alternative to biodiesel. Environmental factors and
   process conditions can alternate the quality and the quantity of lipid
   produced by microalgae, which can be critical for the overall production
   of biodiesel. To maximize both the lipid content and the biomass
   productivity, it is necessary to start with robust algal strains and
   optimal physio-chemical properties of the culture environment in
   combination with a novel culture system. These accumulative approaches
   for cost reduction can take algal process one step closer in achieving
   the economic feasibility.

AB Purpose of Review: Increasing environmental problems demand mitigation
   solutions to fulfill sustainability development goals. Microalgae offer
   possibility of valorizing the CO2and wastewater-derived nutrients to
   produce numerous industrial bioproducts. However, developing
   self-sustained systems for the complete valorization of algal biomass
   into valuable biobased products is challenging. Currently, sustainable
   algal processing faces several challenges including costly cultivation,
   difficult harvesting, and incomplete biomass valorization. This review
   assessed the prospects of emerging technologies focusing on the
   integrated approaches for sustainable algal biorefinery development
   ensuring the sustainability of environment-water-energy nexus. Recent
   Findings: Evaluation of various upstream, midstream, and downstream
   processing technologies provided insights into the processing issues. In
   upstream processing, high-rate algal ponds and integrated carbon capture
   and transformation technologies offer waste valorization into
   eco-friendly algal production. A brief comparison of harvesting
   technologies mainly focusing on chemical and biological flocculation has
   shown that integrating physical and biological harvesting methods are
   more reliable and efficient. Overview of downstream processing has
   indicated that biomass processing in a cascading manner offers the
   complete biomass valorization in a zero-waste paradigm. Summary:
   Assessment of cultivation-to-production technologies highlighted that
   "zero-waste" algal biorefinery has the potential to become reality by
   integrating the industry 4.0 and phenomics approaches with eco-friendly
   cultivation, harvesting, and processing technologies. Hybrid methods
   based on integrated cascading processing offer complete biomass
   valorization in a circular bioeconomy paradigm.

AB Microalgae are a non-food grade, fast-growing, and non-land competitive
   biomass with relatively high energy content. The high lipid and mineral
   contents of microalgae render it beneficial for the production of
   biofuels and value-added products. The complete energy-effective
   harnessing of microalgae potentials concerning biodiesel production is
   faced with drawbacks because of the energy-intensive steps required to
   harvest and dry microalgae. The limitations have impelled the search for
   alternative and low-cost utilization of microalgae in wet form for
   biofuel production. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is among the wet techniques
   for the valorization of microalgae that is gaining immense research
   attention because of its simplicity. Also, the products can be recycled
   to reduce material costs. This review is focused on the recent trends
   and comparison of the AD process to maximize energy recovery from
   microalgae biomass and co-digestion of microalgae waste coupled to
   biodiesel production (after lipid extraction), respectively. The yield
   of methane gas in these two processes is compared and the pros and cons
   of biogas production using microalgae biomass and microalgae waste
   considering that the former produces biofuels and the later value-added
   products are discussed.

AB Microalgae are being proposed as excellent substrates for different
   biorefinery processes. Anaerobic digestion process of microalgae is one
   of these interesting processes but has some limitations in deleting cell
   walls. For this reason, many studies proposed different types of
   pre-treatments, entailing energy, operation, and investment costs. This
   work aims to optimize the anaerobic digestion of the microalgaeChlorella
   sorokinianaandChlorella sorokiniana(strain S12/S13/S16) without any
   pre-treatment by selecting the optimal harvesting time. The greatest
   influence is seen at 5:00 PM in methane production for both microalgae.
   ForChlorella sorokiniana, it is the most optimal moment for anaerobic
   digestion, whereasChlorella sorokiniana(strain S12/S13/S16) is the least
   optimal. In the other harvesting times, both microalgae present a
   similar methane production, i.e. 173  12 mL CH4/g of total volatile
   solids. The highest methane production rate values were obtained during
   peak sunlight, 1:00 PM and 8:00 AM, respectively, and lower overnight.

AB Overexpression ofDunaliella parva(D. parva) malic enzyme (ME) gene
   (DpME) significantly increasedDpMEexpression and ME enzyme activity in
   transgenicD. parva. Nitrogen limitation had an inhibitory effect on
   protein content, andDpMEoverexpression could improve protein content.
   Nitrogen limitation increased carbohydrate content, andDunaliella
   parvaoverexpressing malic enzyme gene under nitrogen limitation
   (DpME-N-) group showed the lowest starch content among all
   groups.Dunaliella parvaoverexpressing malic enzyme gene under nitrogen
   sufficient condition (DpME) and DpME-N-groups showed considerably high
   mRNA levels ofDpME.ME activity was significantly enhanced
   byDpMEoverexpression, and nitrogen limitation caused a smaller
   increase.DpMEoverexpression and nitrogen limitation obviously enhanced
   lipid accumulation, andDpMEoverexpression had more obvious effect.
   Compared with control (wild type), lipid content (68.97%) obviously
   increased in DpME-N-group. This study indicated that the combination
   ofDpMEoverexpression and nitrogen limitation was favorable to the
   production of microalgae biodiesel.

PY 2017

U2 28
AB An integrated microalgal biorefinery is desirable from an economic
   standpoint but challenging to synthesize, due to diversity of options.
   This work uses a model-based optimization approach to address this
   challenge in a systematic manner. A superstructure of the integrated
   biorefinery is developed where biodiesel is considered as the main
   product, while polar lipid, protein, and carbohydrate are also processed
   to various value-added compounds. Mass balances, equipment capacity
   limitations, and cost functions corresponding to these processes
   constitute the constraints of the optimization problem. The decision
   variables include the process synthesis as well as process scheduling
   and operations-related decisions. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming
   (MILP) model was developed to minimize the net annualized life cycle
   cost (ALCC) of the biorefinery. For a scenario of 30 Mg/d production
   target of biodiesel, with no intermediate storage between the stages,
   the superstructure yielded an optimal biodiesel production cost of
   US$8.53/L and reduced sugar was selected as a co-product. Several cases
   were analyzed in terms of the decision making of the process on the
   upstream and downstream levels, as well as variations in scheduling
   strategies. Co-cultivation of the phototrophic and heterotrophic strains
   resulted in net ALCC of US$7.66/L, which was 10.2% less than the base
   case. Batch scheduling with various strategies were also investigated
   and the case with infinite intermediate storage coupled with
   debottlenecking reduced the net ALCC by 25% to US$6.4/L.

PY 2014

U2 82
AB Energy-intensive chemical conversion of crude algal oils into biodiesel
   is a major barrier for cost-effective algal biofuel production. To
   overcome this problem, we developed an enzyme-based platform for
   conversion of crude algal oils into fatty acid methyl esters. Crude
   algal oils were extracted from the oleaginous microalga Nannochloropsis
   oceanica IMET1 and converted by an immobilized lipase from Candida
   antarctica. The effects of different acyl acceptors, t-butanol as a
   co-solvent, oil to t-butanol ratio, oil to methanol ratio, temperature
   and reaction time on biodiesel conversion efficiency were studied. The
   conversion efficiency reached 99.1% when the conversion conditions were
   optimized, i.e., an oil to t-butanol weight ratio of 1:1, an oil to
   methanol molar ratio of 1:12, and a reaction time of 4 h at 25°C. The
   enzymatic conversion process developed in this study may hold a promise
   for low energy consumption, low wastewater-discharge biochemical
   conversion of algal feedstocks into biofuels.

AB The current use of fossil fuels is problematic for both environmental
   and economic reasons and biofuels are regarded as a potential solution
   to current energy issues. This study analyzes the energy balances and
   greenhouse gas emissions of 24 different technology scenarios for the
   production of algal biodiesel fromNannochloropsiscultivated at
   industrial scale in photobioreactors in Denmark. Both consolidated and
   pioneering technologies are analyzed focusing on strengths and
   weaknesses which influence the performance. Based on literature data,
   energy balance and greenhouse gas emissions are determined in a
   comparative 'well-to-tank' Life Cycle Assessment against fossil diesel.
   Use of by-products from biodiesel production such as glycerol obtained
   from transesterification and anaerobic digestion of residual biomass are
   included. Different technologies and methods are considered in
   cultivation stage (freshwater vs. wastewater; synthetic CO2vs. waste
   CO2), harvesting stage (flocculation vs. centrifugation) and oil
   extraction stage (hexane extraction vs. supercritical CO2extraction).
   The choices affecting environmental performance of the scenarios are
   evaluated. Results show that algal biodiesel produced through current
   conventional technologies has higher energy demand and greenhouse gas
   emissions than fossil diesel. However, greenhouse gas emissions of algal
   biodiesel can be significantly reduced through the use of 'waste' flows
   (nutrients and CO2) but there are still technical difficulties with both
   microalgae cultivation in wastewater as well as transportation and
   injection of waste CO2. In any way, a positive energy balance is still
   far from being achieved. Considerable improvements must be made to
   develop an environmentally beneficial microalgae biodiesel production on
   an industrial scale. In particular, different aspects of cultivation
   need to be enhanced, such as the use of wastewater and CO2-rich flue gas
   from industrial power plants.

U2 187
AB Surface and water bodies in many parts of the world are affected due to
   eutrophication, contamination and depletion. The approach of wastewater
   treatment using algae for eliminating nutrients and other pollutants
   from domestic wastewater is growing interest among the researchers.
   However, sustainable treatment of the wastewater is considered to be
   important in establishing more effective nutrient and pollutant
   reduction using algal systems. In comparison to the conventional method
   of remediation, there are opportunities to commercially viable
   businesses interest with phycoremediation, thus by achieving cost
   reductions and renewable bioenergy options. Phycoremediation is an
   intriguing stage for treating wastewater since it provides tertiary
   bio-treatment while producing potentially valuable biomass that may be
   used for a variety of applications. Furthermore, the phycoremediation
   provides the ability to remove heavy metals as well as harmful organic
   substances, without producing secondary contamination. In this review,
   the role of microalgae in treating different wastewaters and the process
   parameters affecting the treatment and future scope of research have
   been discussed. Though several algae are employed for wastewater
   treatment, species of the genera Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, and
   Scenedesmus are extensively utilized. Interestingly, there is a vast
   scope for employing algal species with high flocculation capacity and
   adsorption mechanisms for the elimination of microplastics. In addition,
   the algal biomass generated during phycoremediation has been found to
   possess high protein and lipid contents, promising their exploitation in
   biofuel, food and animal feed industries.

AB This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of different
   nitrate concentrations in culture medium on oil content and fatty acid
   composition of Chlorella vulgaris (UMT-M1) and Chlorella sorokiniana
   (KS-MB2). Results showed that both species produced significant higher
   (p<0.05) oil content at nitrate ranging from 0.18 to 0.66 mM with C.
   vulgaris produced 10.20-11.34% dw, while C. sorokiniana produced
   15.44-17.32% dw. The major fatty acids detected include C16:0, C18:0,
   C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3. It is interesting to note that both species
   displayed differentially regulated fatty acid accumulation patterns in
   response to nitrate treatments at early stationary growth phase. Their
   potential use for biodiesel application could be enhanced by exploring
   the concept of binary blending of the two microalgae oils using
   developed mathematical equations to calculate the oil mass blending
   ratio and simultaneously estimated the weight percentage (wt.%) of
   desirable fatty acid compositions.

AB To utilize CO2 in syngas from coal gasification with H2S impurity for
   microalgal biodiesel production, metabolic regulation stimulated by NaHS
   (an H2S donor) of carbon allocation and energy supply in Nannochloropsis
   oceanica were investigated to improve lipid accumulation. Enzyme
   analysis showed that H2S (NaHS ≤0.5 mM) enhanced glycolysis and fatty
   acids synthesis, as well as suppressed the desaturation, elongation, and
   degradation of fatty acids during intracellular carbon metabolism.
   Additionally, H2S transformed the main ATP synthesis pathway from
   oxidative phosphorylation to photophosphorylation and substrate
   phosphorylation, facilitating efficient energy supply during lipid
   accumulation. Raman spectra and transmission electron microscopy showed
   that the peak rate of lipid accumulation increased by 60.2-62.2% in N.
   oceanica cells exposed to 0.5 mM NaHS. This markedly increased the
   yields of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and short-chain FAMEs (C12:0
   and C14:0) from N. oceanica cells by 77.0 and 144.4%, respectively, and
   decreased the unsaturated lipid composition in total FAMEs by 44.8%.

AB In biorefining, biomass is processed sustainably to produce multiple
   high-value products. The biorefinery concept has been acknowledged as
   the most promising tactic for creating a biomass-based
   business/industry. Biomass from microalgae includes a variety of
   beneficial bioactive elements like pigments, proteins, polyunsaturated
   fatty acids, and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). In addition, microalgal
   cells can also be utilized as a source of raw materials to make biofuel.
   In order to reduce overall process costs, these value-added chemicals
   can be extracted concurrently or sequentially with biodiesel. Further,
   to promote microalgae in the industrial sector, a biorefinery approach
   is crucial. Researchers have been eager to use the bio-refinery strategy
   for obtaining the high-value constituents entrapped by microalgae.
   Microalgae not only contain a variety of valuable chemicals but also
   contribute in lowering the atmospheric levels of anthropogenic carbon
   dioxide. These advantages make microalgae a viable resource for
   bio-refinery strategy. This review intends to emphasize the valuable
   properties of microalgae together with their significance to people.
   This article also highlights the recent as well as upcoming developments
   that will increase the viability of bio-processing for microalgal-based
   bio-refinery.

AB Recent research has demonstrated that synthetic
   methanotroph-photoautotroph cocultures offer a highly promising route to
   convert biogas into value-added products. However, there is a lack of
   techniques for fast and accurate characterization of cocultures, such as
   determining the individual biomass concentration of each organism in
   real-time. To address this unsolved challenge, we propose an
   experimental-computational protocol for fast, easy, and accurate
   quantitative characterization of the methanotroph-photoautotroph
   cocultures. Besides determining the individual biomass concentration of
   each organism in the coculture, the protocol can also obtain the
   individual consumption and production rates of O2and CO2for the
   methanotroph and photoautotroph, respectively. The accuracy and
   effectiveness of the proposed protocol was demonstrated using two model
   coculture pairs,Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum20ZR-Synechococcussp.
   PCC7002 that prefers high pH high salt condition, andMethylococcus
   capsulatus-Chlorella sorokinianathat prefers low salt and neutral pH
   medium. The performance of the proposed protocol was compared with a
   flow cytometry-based cell counting approach. The experimental results
   show that the proposed protocol is much easier to carry out and delivers
   faster and more accurate results in measuring individual biomass
   concentration than the cell counting approach without requiring any
   special equipment.

AB To understand the mechanism of lipid accumulation and the corresponding
   metabolic changes of the microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1, the
   lipid content, fatty acid composition and metabolic profile were
   investigated via batch culture under nutrient deficiency and chemostatic
   culture under nitrate limitation. The results indicated that the
   triacylglycerol-neutral lipids were significantly accumulated through an
   acyl-CoA dependent pathway, while the polar lipids were partially
   converted to triacylglycerol through an acyl-CoA independent pathway.
   The fatty acid compositions of the polar lipids changed concurrently
   with the length of time of the nutrient deficiency, while the fatty acid
   compositions of the neutral lipids remained nearly consistent. The
   concentrations of several major osmolytes were significantly changed
   under chemostatic conditions with different nitrogen concentrations,
   which reflect the membrane property changes caused by the alteration of
   the polar lipid composition.
