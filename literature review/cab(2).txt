AB Microalgae are regarded as a promising source of biofuels, and the
   concept of a microalgae-based biorefinery has attracted increasing
   attention in recent years. From an economic perspective, however, the
   process remains far from competitive with fossil fuels. This is
   particularly true of lipid extraction, due in part to the
   energy-intensive drying step. As a result, wet extraction methods have
   been studied as an economic alternative. In the present study, a novel
   extraction approach which utilizes high shear stress mixing was adopted
   and demonstrated for simultaneous lipid extraction and cell disruption
   to enable the retrieval of lipids directly from concentrated wet
   biomass. When a high shear mixer (HSM) was used to extract lipid from a
   dense biomass (>350 g/L) of the oleaginous algae Aurantiochytrium sp.,
   it exhibited a yield of esterifiable lipids which exceeded 80% in 10 min
   at 15,000 rpm with various solvent types. The HSM was found to improve
   the lipid yields substantially with solvents less miscible with either
   lipids or water, such that the range of Hansen solubility parameters for
   the usable solvents became 3.3 times wider (14.9-26.5 MPa1/2). The HSM,
   which appeared effectively to loosen the water barrier that prevents
   solvent molecules from penetrating through the cell envelope, was found
   to be more efficient with hexane, hexane/isopropanol, and ethanol, all
   of which showed nearly identical lipid yields compared to the dry
   extraction process. The HSM can, indeed, offer a powerful mechanical
   means of lipid extraction with non-polar and less toxic solvents from
   wet biomass.

AB Microalgae have a great potential for the sustainable production of food
   and fuel for a growing world population with increasing demands and
   changing habits. Since they are cultivated in technical systems, they do
   not contribute to land use competition, loss of biodiversity, and
   environmental pollution like other food and energy crops. Despite these
   advantages, the commercialization of algae technology is still in an
   infant stage. Algae fuel production has so far failed due to low oil
   prices and lack of economic viability. However, integrated food and fuel
   production is considered promising because the food market is more
   diversified and open to new and innovative products than the energy
   market. Integrated food and fuel production from microalgae can not only
   achieve higher returns on investment but also greater acceptance than
   fuel production alone. From the sociotechnical point of view, it is
   however crucial that the integrated algae production system will fulfill
   the promises of health and sustainability. To achieve this, a codesign
   approach is used, considering public perception and the views, knowledge
   and values of citizens and stakeholders already at an early stage in the
   research and innovation process.

AB The integration of microalgae-based biofuel and bioproducts production
   with wastewater treatment has major advantages for both industries.
   However, major challenges to the implementation of an integrated system
   include the large-scale production of algae and the harvesting of
   microalgae in a way that allows for downstream processing to produce
   biofuels and other bioproducts of value. Although the majority of algal
   production systems use suspended cultures in either open ponds or closed
   reactors, the use of attached cultures may offer several advantages.
   With regard to harvesting methods, better understanding and control of
   autoflocculation and bioflocculation could improve performance and
   reduce chemical addition requirements for conventional mechanical
   methods that include centrifugation, tangential filtration, gravity
   sedimentation, and dissolved air flotation. There are many approaches
   currently used by companies and industries using clean water at
   laboratory, bench, and pilot scale; however, large-scale systems for
   controlled algae production and/or harvesting for wastewater treatment
   and subsequent processing for bioproducts are lacking. Further
   investigation and development of large-scale production and harvesting
   methods for biofuels and bioproducts are necessary, particularly with
   less studied but promising approaches such as those involving attached
   algal biofilm cultures.

AB Cyanobacterial biomass is a promising natural resource for power
   generation, through the reactions bio-catalyzed by electrochemically
   active bacteria (EAB). However, the major limitation is the involvement
   of Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in inhibiting EAB activation. In this work,
   toxic M. aeruginosa biomass was employed as analyte of a microbial fuel
   cell (MFC), and sodium acetate was applied as easy-to-biodegrade
   co-substrate to alleviate the MC-LR stress on EAB survival. The running
   stability was continuously enhanced with the increment of co-substrate
   concentration. The sufficient co-substrate supply (6.0 mM) eliminated
   the negative effects of MC-LR on the cyanobacteria biomass fed-MFC
   performance; it contributed 12.7% extension on the electric cyclic terms
   and caused the productions of the power density which was comparable and
   even 3.8% higher than its corresponding control (MFC treated with
   acetate alone). The co-substrate addition also increased coulombic
   efficiency by 60.1%, microcystin-LR removal efficiency increased by
   64.7%, and diversified the microbial community with more species able to
   biodegrade the MC-LR, bio-transforming the metabolites and EAB.
   Microcystin-degrading bacteria, such as Sphingopyxis sp.,
   Burkholderia-Paraburkholderia, and Bacillus sp., were remarkably
   increased, and EAB, including Shewanella sp., Desulfovibrio
   desulfuricans, Aeromonas hydrophila, were also much more enriched in
   co-substrate use protocol. Therefore, this study verified a co-substrate
   strategy for simultaneously eliminating MC-LR toxin and enhancing
   bioelectricity generation from cyanobacterial biomass via an MFC.

AB Microalgae provide a well balanced mixture of nutrients to organisms
   higher in the food web. Indeed life in the oceans is ultimately
   dependent on the organic matter produced by microalgae through
   photosynthesis. These aquatic food-chains are mimicked in aquaculture
   where microalgae are used as live feeds for a variety of animals
   including molluscs, larval stages of crustaceans and some fish species,
   and as food for zooplankton which in turn are used as live feeds for
   other animals. Microalgae contain high, but variable, percentages of the
   key macronutrients: typically 25 to 40% protein (of DW), 5 to 30%
   carbohydrate and 10 to 30% lipid. The proportions of each nutrient can
   be modified by careful selection of growth conditions or by harvesting
   the microalgae at different growth stages. All species have similar
   amino acid compositions and are rich in the essential amino acids. The
   sugar composition of polysaccharides is more variable, but most have
   high proportions of glucose (21-87%). Most microalgae are rich sources
   of one or both of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids'
   eicosapentaenoic acid 20:5(n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid 22:6(n-3).
   These fatty acids are essential for the growth of marine fish larvae.
   Green microalgae tend to be poor sources of these polyunsaturated fatty
   acids: prasinophytes have moderate amounts of 22:6(n-3) (4-10%), whereas
   chlorophytes are deficient in both acids (0-3%). Microalgae also contain
   significant quantities of micronutrients and antioxidants such as the
   vitamins ascorbic acid (1-16 mg g-1DW), riboflavin (20-40 g g-1) and
   tocopherols as well as different carotenoids and a surprising variety of
   novel lipids. Details of the nutritional values of the different classes
   of microalgae, based on their biochemical composition, are discussed in
   this review plus comments on the applications of microalgae to
   aquaculture nutrition. Uses of microalgae also extend well beyond
   aquaculture to include commercial sources of carotenoid pigments, single
   cell oils having a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary
   supplements such as 'Spirulina' tablets, biodiesel and many others.

AB Background: Microalgae accumulate lipids when exposed to stressful
   conditions such as nutrient limitation that can be used to generate
   biofuels. Nitrogen limitation or deprivation is a strategy widely
   employed to elicit this response. However, this strategy is associated
   with a reduction in the microalgal growth, leading to overall poor lipid
   productivities. Here, we investigated the combined effect of a reduced
   source of nitrogen (ammonium) and super-saturating light intensities on
   the growth and induction of lipid accumulation in two model but diverse
   microalgal species,Phaeodactylum tricornutumandNannochloropsis oceanica.
   We hypothesized that the lower energy cost of assimilating ammonium
   would allow the organisms to use more reductant power for lipid
   biosynthesis without compromising growth and that this would be further
   stimulated by the effect of high light (1000 mol m-2s-1) stress. We
   studied the changes in growth and physiology of both species when grown
   in culture media that either contained nitrate or ammonium as the
   nitrogen source, and an additional medium that contained ammonium with
   tungsten in place of molybdenum and compared this with growth in media
   without nitrogen. We focused our investigation on the early stages of
   exposure to the treatments to correspond to events relevant to induction
   of lipid accumulation in these two species. Results: At super-saturating
   light intensities, lipid productivity inP. tricornutumincreased twofold
   when grown in ammonium compared to nitrogen free medium that increased
   further when tungsten was present in the medium in place of molybdenum.
   Conversely,N. oceanicagrowth and physiology was not compromised by the
   high light intensities used, and the use of ammonium had a negative
   effect on the lipid productivity, which was even more marked when
   tungsten was present. Conclusions: Whilst the use of ammonium and
   super-saturating light intensities inP. tricornutumwas revealed to be a
   good strategy for increasing lipid biosynthesis, no changes in the lipid
   productivity ofN. oceanicawere observed, under these conditions. Both
   results provide relevant direction for the better design of processes to
   produce biofuels in microalgae by manipulating growth conditions without
   the need to subject them to genetic engineering manipulation.

AB The microalgal strainScenedesmus rubescensKNUA042 was identified in
   freshwater in Korea and characterized by evaluating its stress responses
   in an effort to increase lipid and carotenoid production. Under a
   two-stage cultivation process, the algal strain that generally exhibits
   optimal growth at a nitrate (source of nitrogen) concentration of 0.25 g
   L-1was challenged to different exogenous stimuli - salinity (S), light
   intensity (L), combined L and S (LS), and nitrogen deficiency (C) - for
   14 days. Lipid production and carotenoid concentration increased in a
   time-dependent manner under these physicochemical conditions during the
   culture periods. Lipid accumulation was confirmed by thin layer
   chromatography, BODIPY staining, and fatty acid composition analysis,
   which showed no differences in the algal cells tested under all four (C,
   S, L, and LS) conditions. The quality of biodiesel produced from the
   biomass of the algal cells met the American Society for Testing and
   Materials and the European standards. Total carotenoid content was
   increased in the LS-treated algal cells (6.94 mg L-1) compared with that
   in the C-, S-, and L-treated algal cells 1.75, 4.15, and 1.32 mg L-1,
   respectively. Accordingly, the concentration of canthaxanthin and
   astaxanthin was also maximized in the LS-treated algal cells at 1.73 and
   1.11 mg g-1, respectively, whereas lutein showed no differences in the
   cells analyzed. Conversely, chlorophyll a level was similar among the
   C-, S-, and LS-treated algal cells, except for the L-treated algal
   cells. Thus, our results suggested thatS. rubescensKNUA042 was capable
   of producing carotenoid molecules, which led to the maximum values of
   canthaxanthin and astaxanthin concentrations when exposed to the
   combined LS condition compared with that observed when exposed to the
   salinity condition alone. This indicates that the algal strain could be
   used for the production of high-value products as well as biofuel.
   Furthermore, this article provides the first evidence of carotenoid
   production inS. rubescensKNUA042.

AB Microalgal lipids are precursors to the production of biodiesel, as well
   as a source of valuable dietary components in the biotechnological
   industries. So, this study aimed to assess the effects of nutritional
   (nitrogen, and phosphorus) starvations and salinity stress (NaCl) on the
   biomass, lipid content, fatty acids profile, and predicted biodiesel
   properties of green microalga Monoraphidium braunii. The results showed
   that biomass, biomass productivity, and photosynthetic pigment contents
   (Chl. a, b, and carotenoids) of M. braunii were markedly decreased by
   nitrogen and phosphorus depletion and recorded the maximum values in
   cultures treated with full of N and P concentrations (control, 100%).
   These parameters were considerably increased at the low salinity level
   (up to 150 mM NaCl), while an increasing salinity level (up to 250 mM
   NaCl) reduces the biomass, its productivity, and pigment contents.
   Nutritional limitations and salt stress (NaCl) resulted in significantly
   enhanced accumulation of lipid and productivity of M. braunii, which
   represented more than twofold of the control. Furthermore, these
   conditions have enhanced the profile of fatty acid and biodiesel
   quality-related parameters. The current study exposed strategies to
   improve M. braunii lipid productivity for biodiesel production on a
   small scale in vitro in terms of fuel quality under low nutrients and
   salinity stress.

AB Microalgae are recognized as one of the most powerful biotechnology
   platforms for many value added products including biofuels, bioactive
   compounds, animal and aquaculture feed etc. However, large scale
   production of microalgal biomass poses challenges due to the
   requirements of large amounts of water and nutrients for cultivation.
   Using wastewater for microalgal cultivation has emerged as a potential
   cost effective strategy for large scale microalgal biomass production.
   This approach also offers an efficient means to remove nutrients and
   metals from wastewater making wastewater treatment sustainable and
   energy efficient. Therefore, much research has been conducted in the
   recent years on utilizing various wastewater streams for microalgae
   cultivation. This review identifies and discusses the opportunities and
   challenges of different wastewater streams for microalgal cultivation.
   Many alternative routes for microalgal cultivation have been proposed to
   tackle some of the challenges that occur during microalgal cultivation
   in wastewater such as nutrient deficiency, substrate inhibition,
   toxicity etc. Scope and challenges of microalgal biomass grown on
   wastewater for various applications are also discussed along with the
   biorefinery approach.

AB Cyanobacteria, photosynthetic prokaryotic microorganisms having a simple
   genetic composition are the prospective photoautotrophic cell factories
   for the production of a wide range of biofuel molecules. The simple
   genetic composition of cyanobacteria allows effortless genetic
   manipulation which leads to increased research endeavors from the
   synthetic biology approach. Various unicellular model cyanobacterial
   strains like Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC
   7942 have been successfully engineered for biofuels generation. Improved
   development of synthetic biology tools, genetic modification methods and
   advancement in transformation techniques to construct a strain that can
   contain multiple foreign genes in a single operon have vastly expanded
   the functions that can be used for engineering photosynthetic
   cyanobacteria for the generation of various biofuel molecules. In this
   review, recent advancements and approaches in synthetic biology tools
   used for cyanobacterial genome editing have been discussed. Apart from
   this, cyanobacterial productions of various fuel molecules like
   isoprene, limonene, alpha-farnesene, squalene, alkanes, butanol, and
   fatty acids, which can be a substitute for petroleum and fossil fuels in
   the future, have been elaborated.

AB Biorefinery of biomass blends can achieve sustainable development of
   biofuel production. Herein, three lignocellulosic wastes with
   significant differences in chemical composition - namely corncob (CC),
   sugarcane bagasse (SB), andBroussonetia papyrifera(BP) - were selected
   to investigate their hydrothermal co-hydrolysis kinetics and
   thermodynamics of different biomass blends. Activation energies of
   hemicellulose decomposition (Ea1, 90.59 kJ/mol) for CC/SB were lower
   than those for CC (126.12 kJ/mol) and CC/SB/BP (153.62 kJ/mol). BP
   (having a high content of nitrogen sources) loading weakened the acidic
   autohydrolysis of CC/SB hemicellulose, but yielded stable products as
   indicated by the negative entropy value for CC/SB/BP hydrolysis.
   Cumulative feedback inhibition occurred among different biomass, and it
   could be minimized by controlling the blending ratio. The highest total
   xylose yield was 83.64% for CC/SB with a mass ratio of 2:1. Moreover,
   biomass blend of CC/SB/BP enabled complete utilization of hexose,
   pentose and amino acids by co-production of ethanol and microalga
   biomass.

AB Although microalgae can serve as an appropriate alternative feedstock
   for biofuel production, the high microalgal cultivation cost has been a
   major obstacle for commercializing such attempts. One of the feasible
   solution for cost reduction is to couple microalgal biofuel production
   system with wastewater treatment, as microalgae are known to effectively
   eliminate a variety of nutrients/pollutants in wastewater, such as
   nitrogen/phosphate, organic carbons, VFAs, pharmaceutical compounds,
   textile dye compounds, and heavy metals. This review aims to critically
   discuss the feasibility of microalgae-based wastewater treatment,
   including the strategies for strain selection, the effect of wastewater
   types, photobioreactor design, economic feasibility assessment, and
   other key issues that influence the treatment performance. The potential
   of microalgae-bacteria consortium for treatment of industrial
   wastewaters is also discussed. This review provides useful information
   for developing an integrated wastewater treatment with microalgal
   biomass and biofuel production facilities and establishing efficient
   co-cultivation for microalgae and bacteria in such systems.

AB The fuel properties of microalgal biodiesel are predicted using
   published microalgal fatty acid (FA) compositions and predictive fuel
   models. Biodiesels produced from the microalgae investigated are
   predicted to have extremely poor oxidative stabilities and the majority
   also have poor cold-flow properties. The cetane number in most cases is
   out of specification, but less so than the oxidative stability and cold
   flow. These findings support the idea that feedstocks rich in
   monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are desirable for biodiesel but the
   composition of the saturated fatty acids (SFAs) is also shown to be of
   great importance. There is an apparent relationship between algal class
   and the percentage of FAs represented by MUFA. This potentially allows
   for the identification of high-MUFA algal classes, or at least provides
   some basis for researchers to make initial selections of target classes
   for bioprospecting. Comparisons of FA groups between algal classes also
   show that the SFAs of Mediophyceae contain significantly higher
   proportions of C14:0, which is in contrast to the normally abundant
   C16:0 and the Mediophyceae therefore have better cold-flow
   characteristics than other classes with similar total SFA contents.
   Certain particularly promising cases for biodiesel production are
   presented as species level examples of feedstocks that are close to
   satisfying the biodiesel standards and to further illustrate the
   challenges that remain. Variation in FA composition as a response to
   changes in certain environmental variables forms another important facet
   to feedstock selection and is briefly considered, with suggestions for
   further research.

AB Purpose of Review: Microalgae-mediated resource recovery and recycling
   of wastewater might be useful in producing biomass, biofertilizers, and
   environmentally acceptable bioproducts. This review aims to provide a
   comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities of
   wastewater valorization to valuable algal biomass by opting a
   self-sustainable carbon-neutral approach. Recent Findings: Various
   challenges and opportunities of using unsterilized urban wastewater are
   explored to provide insights into addressing the processing issues.
   Major wastewater challenges include turbidity with blackish appearance,
   emerging contaminants, pathogenic microbial community, and higher
   nutrient load. A brief comparison of sterilization techniques has been
   made, mainly focusing on principles, advantages, and limitations.
   Despite the challenges, it is found that microalgae-based resource
   recovery could be a viable and promising opportunity in a
   wastewater-driven integrated biorefinery paradigm. Summary: Despite the
   availability of various wastewater treatment methods, microalgae-based
   wastewater treatment is promising, and carbon neutral approach which
   transforms the nutrients to valuable biomass, thereby reducing the
   nutrient load of the water. However, microalgal cultivation in
   wastewater encounters physical and biological challenges. In this
   article, challenges, opportunities, and sterilization methods of
   wastewater are critically reviewed concerning microalgae-based resource
   recovery from the urban wastewater. The processing of
   wastewater-produced algal biomass could be valorized into multiple
   products in minimal waste and carbon-neutral paradigm.

AB Microalgae are now the focus of intensive research due to their
   potential as a renewable feedstock for biodiesel. This research requires
   a thorough understanding of the biochemistry and genetics of these
   organisms' lipid-biosynthesis pathways. Genes encoding
   lipid-biosynthesis enzymes can now be identified in the genomes of
   various eukaryotic microalgae. However, an examination of the predicted
   proteins at the biochemical and molecular levels is mandatory to verify
   their function. The essential molecular and genetic tools are now
   available for a comprehensive characterization of genes coding for
   enzymes of the lipid-biosynthesis pathways in some algal species. This
   review mainly summarizes the novel information emerging from recently
   obtained algal gene identification.

AB Microalgae-derived biofuels have potential advantages over other
   renewable, crop-based resources; however, large-scale production is not
   currently economical due, in part, to challenges in the harvesting step.
   In this article, we present a novel approach for the dewatering and
   harvesting of microalgae using flocculants that can be recovered and
   recycled. Polyampholytes with molecular charges dependent upon pH
   (ranging from net positively- to net negatively-charged) are used as a
   model flocculant system and provide reversible electrostatic
   interactions with the negatively-charged algal cells. These pH-dependent
   properties allow the polyampholytic flocculants to efficiently desorb
   from concentrated biomass and, unlike most commercial flocculants that
   have permanently charged functionalities, be recovered and recycled for
   further dewatering processes. The behavior of the model polyampholytic
   flocculants is characterized for the dewatering of Chlorella vulgaris
   (UTEX 395). The reversible and recyclable flocculants achieve >99%
   flocculation efficiencies, are recovered at more than 98wt% yields after
   biomass dewatering, and can be recycled over five times for
   flocculation.

AB Background: Successful implementation of modified cyanobacteria as hosts
   for industrial applications requires the development of a cyanobacterial
   chassis. The cyanobacteriumSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 embodies key
   attributes for an industrial host, including a fast growth rate and high
   salt, light, and temperature tolerances. This study addresses key
   limitations in the advancement ofSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 as an
   industrial chassis. Results: Tools for genome integration were developed
   and characterized, including several putative neutral sites for genome
   integration. The minimum homology arm length for genome integration
   inSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 was determined to be approximately 250 bp.
   Three fluorescent protein reporters (hGFP, Ypet, and mOrange) were
   characterized for gene expression, microscopy, and flow cytometry
   applications inSynechococcussp. PCC 7002. Of these three proteins, the
   yellow fluorescent protein (Ypet) had the best optical properties for
   minimal interference with the native photosynthetic pigments and for
   detection using standard microscopy and flow cytometry optics.
   Twenty-five native promoters were characterized as tools for recombinant
   gene expression inSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 based on previous RNA-seq
   results. This characterization included comparisons of protein and mRNA
   levels as well as expression under both continuous and diurnal light
   conditions. Promoters A2520 and A2579 were found to have strong
   expression inSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 while promoters A1930, A1961,
   A2531, and A2813 had moderate expression. Promoters A2520 and A2813
   showed more than twofold increases in gene expression under light
   conditions compared to dark, suggesting these promoters may be useful
   tools for engineering diurnal regulation. Conclusions: The genome
   integration, fluorescent protein, and promoter tools developed in this
   study will help to advanceSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 as a cyanobacterial
   chassis. The long minimum homology arm length forSynechococcussp. PCC
   7002 genome integration indicates native exonuclease activity or a low
   efficiency of homologous recombination. Low correlation between
   transcript and protein levels inSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 suggests that
   transcriptomic data are poor selection criteria for promoter tool
   development. Lastly, the conventional strategy of using promoters from
   photosynthetic operons as strong promoter tools is debunked, as
   promoters from hypothetical proteins (A2520 and A2579) were found to
   have much higher expression levels.

AB Several studies have shown that any magnetic field (MF) applied to
   microalgae modifies its cultivation conditions and may favor biomolecule
   production since it interacts with the microorganisms and affect their
   growth. As a result, there are changes in concentrations and
   compositions of biomass and biomolecules. This review aims at updating
   MF applications to microalga cultures that were reported by studies
   conducted in the last 5 years. It shows the main studies that reached
   positive results of carbohydrate, lipid, protein and pigment production.
   Effects of MFs may be positive, negative or null, depending on some
   factors, such as intensity, exposure time, physiological state of cells
   and application devices. Therefore, this review details cultivation
   conditions used for reaching high concentration of biomolecules,
   explains the action of MFs on microalgae and describes their
   applicability to the biorefinery concept.

AB To mitigate some of the potentially deleterious environmental and

   microbial oxygenic photoautotrophs (AMOPs), more commonly known as

   productivity in mass culturing and aspects of their physiology that are
   particularly attractive for integration into renewable biofuel
   applications. Compared with terrestrial crops, AMOPs are inherently more
   efficient solar collectors, use less or no land, can be converted to
   liquid fuels using simpler technologies than cellulose, and offer
   secondary uses that fossil fuels do not provide. AMOPs pose a new set of
   technological challenges if they are to contribute as biofuel
   feedstocks.

AB Background: One of the major challenges for the present and future
   generations is to find suitable substitutes for the fossil resources we
   rely on today. Cyanobacterial carbohydrates have been discussed as an
   emerging renewable feedstock in industrial biotechnology for the
   production of fuels and chemicals, showing promising production rates
   when compared to crop-based feedstock. However, intrinsic capacities of
   cyanobacteria to produce biotechnological compounds are limited and
   yields are low. Results: Here, we present an approach to circumvent
   these problems by employing a synthetic bacterial co-culture for the
   carbon-neutral production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from CO2. The
   co-culture consists of twobio-modules:Bio-module I, in which the
   cyanobacterial strainSynechococcus elongatus cscBfixes CO2, converts it
   to sucrose, and exports it into the culture supernatant; andbio-module
   II, where this sugar serves as C-source forPseudomonas putida cscABand
   is converted to PHAs that are accumulated in the cytoplasm. By applying
   a nitrogen-limited process, we achieved a maximal PHA production rate of
   23.8 mg/(L day) and a maximal titer of 156 mg/L. We will discuss the
   present shortcomings of the process and show the potential for future
   improvement. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the feasibility of
   mixed cultures ofS. elongatus cscBandP. putida cscABfor PHA production,
   making room for the cornucopia of possible products that are described
   forP. putida. The construction of more efficient sucrose-utilizingP.
   putidaphenotypes and the optimization of process conditions will
   increase yields and productivities and eventually close the gap in the
   contemporary process. In the long term, the co-culture may serve as a
   platform process, in whichP. putidais used as a chassis for the
   implementation of synthetic metabolic pathways for biotechnological
   production of value-added products.

AB Development of low-cost and economic cellulase production is among the
   key challenges due to its broad industrial applications. One of the main
   topics of research pertaining to sustainable biomass waste based
   biorefinaries is the development of economic cellulase production
   strategies. The main cause of the increase in cellulase production costs
   is the use of commercial substrates; as a result, the cost of any
   cellulase-based bioprocess can be decreased by employing a productive,
   low-cost substrate. The goal of the current study is to develop low-cost
   cellulase using the carbohydrate-rich, renewable, and widely accessible
   cyanobacteria algae Oscillatoria obscura as the production substrate.
   Maximum cellulase was produced utilising the fungus Rhizopus oryzae at
   substrate concentration of 7.0 g among various tested concentrations of
   algal biomass. Maximum production rates of 22 IU/gds FP, 105 IU/gds BGL,
   and 116 IU/gds EG in 72 h were possible under optimal conditions and
   substrate concentration. Further investigations on the crude enzyme's
   stability in the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) revealed
   that it was thermally stable at 60°C for up to 8 h. Additionally, the
   crude enzyme demonstrated pH stability by maintaining its complete
   activity at pH 6.0 for 8 h in the presence of the optimal dose of 15 mg
   IONPs. The outcomes of this research may be used to investigate the
   possibility of producing such enzymes in large quantities at low cost
   for industrial use.

AB When cultivated under stress conditions, many plants and algae
   accumulate oil. The unicellular green microalga Chlamydomonas
   reinhardtii accumulates neutral lipids (triacylglycerols; TAGs) during
   nutrient stress conditions. Temporal changes in TAG levels in nitrogen
   (N)- and phosphorus (P)-starved cells were examined to compare the
   effects of nutrient depletion on TAG accumulation in C. reinhardtii. TAG
   accumulation and fatty acid composition were substantially changed
   depending on the cultivation stage before nutrient starvation. Profiles
   of TAG accumulation also differed between N and P starvation.
   Logarithmic-growth-phase cells diluted into fresh medium showed
   substantial TAG accumulation with both N and P deprivation. N
   deprivation induced formation of oil droplets concomitant with the
   breakdown of thylakoid membranes. In contrast, P deprivation
   substantially induced accumulation of oil droplets in the cytosol and
   maintaining thylakoid membranes. As a consequence, P limitation
   accumulated more TAG both per cell and per culture medium under these
   conditions. To enhance oil accumulation under P deprivation, we
   constructed a P deprivation-dependent overexpressor of a Chlamydomonas
   type-2 diacylglycerol acyl-CoA acyltransferase (DGTT4) using a
   sulphoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (SQD2) promoter, which was up-regulated
   during P starvation. The transformant strongly enhanced TAG accumulation
   with a slight increase in 18:1 content, which is a preferred substrate
   of DGTT4. These results demonstrated enhanced TAG accumulation using a P
   starvation-inducible promoter.

U2 87
AB The interest in developing microalgae for industrial use has been
   increasing because of concerns about the depletion of petroleum
   resources and securing sustainable energy sources. Microalgae have high
   biomass productivity and short culture periods. However, despite these
   advantages, various barriers need to be overcome for industrial
   applications. Microalgal cultivation has a high unit price, thus
   rendering industrial application difficult. It is indispensably
   necessary to co-produce their primary and secondary metabolites to
   compensate for these shortcomings. In this regard, this article reviews
   the following aspects, (1) co-production of primary and secondary
   metabolites in microalgae, (2) induction methods for the promotion of
   the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and (3) perspectives on the
   co-production and co-extraction of primary and secondary metabolites.
   This paper presents various approaches for producing useful metabolites
   from microalgae and suggests strategies that can be utilized for the
   co-production of primary and secondary metabolites.

AB The possibility of obtaining commercially valuable products from
   microalgae stimulates scientific research in this direction. The ability
   of microalgae to accumulate lipids is very promising from the point of
   view of practical application. The diversity of the composition of
   microalgae lipids makes it possible to study a wide range of their
   applications: biofuel production, food products, feed for farm animals
   and birds, for aquaculture, food additives, etc. Fatty acids (FAs) are
   involved in the metabolic pathways of formation and conversion of most
   lipid classes, and their composition largely determines their properties
   and practical use. As a result, much attention is paid to the study of
   the composition of fatty acids in microalgae (including cyanobacteria).
   This review summarizes information on the diversity of the fatty acid
   composition of microalgae and cyanobacteria, taking into account their
   rare and unusual categories. The total variety of FA profile of
   microalgae from different habitats is formed by 135 FAs. Taking into
   account the length of the hydrocarbon chain, its structure and the
   presence of substituents, they are distributed into several groups: with
   an even number of carbon atoms in the chain-81 (short-chain FAs-2,
   medium-chain FAs-14, long-chain FAs-28, very-long-chain FAs-37), with an
   odd number of carbon atoms-33, with a branched hydrocarbon chain and
   additional functional groups-21. Among FAs of microalgae there are both
   saturated and unsaturated FAs with different numbers of double bonds:
   saturated FAs-19, monounsaturated FAs-26, polyunsaturated FAs-68. The FA
   profile of microalgae is rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The
   review also considers the use of fatty acids as an industrial resource,
   as well as a biomarker.

U1 0
U2 8
AB It is well understood that both untreated and partially treated
   wastewater comprise substantial amount of resources, which can be
   recovered and utilized for different purposes. Since Waste Water
   Treatment Plant (WWTP) is energy intensive and expensive, substantiating
   the WWTPs with Resource Recover Technologies (RRTs) will not only save a
   considerable amount of energy but also make the environment cleaner and
   safer. In line with this, this paper seeks to review several RRTS and to
   identify their limitations. Several effective nutrient recovery methods
   using both biota (e.g., microalgae, duckweed, aquatic macrophytes) and
   chemical processes (e.g., struvite precipitation and HAIX resin) are
   discussed in this study. The recovered nutrients can be used as
   fertilizer, animal feed and for production of protein rich byproducts.
   In order to enhance the efficiency of nutrient recovery processes,
   several researchers suggest introducing hybrid system of nutrient
   recovery. On the other hand, biosolids, biogas, conserved heat, effluent
   flow, Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC), Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MEC) can
   potentially be employed to produce electricity and other forms of energy
   that can meet the demand of existing WWTPs. Moreover, the comparative
   analysis of these technologies in terms of advantages and disadvantages
   and their recovery potential has been discussed. The review analysis
   indicates that despite having limitations, several RRTs are being
   practiced mostly in developed world. Future research should focus on how
   to increase the efficiency of existing RRTs and identify innovative RRTs
   available in developing countries.

PY 2018
U1 12

AB Achieving high biomass and lipid yields simultaneously during the
   cultivation process is essential and currently represents one of the
   biggest challenges in the production of microalgal biofuel. Using waste
   streams for microalgal growth is essential to improving the economic
   viability of microalgal biofuel systems, and provides an avenue for
   wastewater treatment. In this study, the growth of and nutrient removals
   by Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) under autotrophic, heterotrophic,
   and mixotrophic conditions were optimized for centrate wastewater,
   generated from anaerobic digestion at wastewater treatment plants, as
   well as on glycerol, a byproduct from the downstream microalgal lipid
   transesterification process. Compared to autotrophic and heterotrophic
   conditions, mixotrophic conditions promoted more biomass growth
   (0.720.01 g/L) and yielded higher total chlorophyll (14.20.1 g/ml) and
   carotenoid (12.90.4 g/ml) concentrations. Subsequently, three glycerol
   feeding strategies (single-dose initial feeding, multiple-dose step
   feeding, single-dose exponential feeding) were studied under mixotrophic
   conditions. Feeding glycerol at the late exponential growth stage
   generated the highest biomass (0.0700.001 g/L/d) and lipid (20.43.4
   mg/L/d) productivities as it engaged both autotrophic and heterotrophic
   metabolisms, which enhanced biomass yields. The composition of the
   extracted lipids varied slightly with cultivation conditions, although
   C16, C18 and C24 accounted for 55-82% of the total fatty acids.
   Moreover, under conditions exhibiting high biomass production, almost
   complete nitrogen and phosphorus removals (>99% for both total nitrogen
   and PO43--P) were achieved, primarily through biomass assimilation.
   Finally, an integrated two-phase autotrophic-mixotrophic cultivation
   process for C. vulgaris, with glycerol fed at the exponential growth
   stage, was demonstrated, giving an effective wastewater treatment
   alternative while simultaneously obtaining high lipid productivities for
   biofuel production.

U2 58
AB Eutrophication of water catchments and the greenhouse effect are major
   challenges in developing the global economy in the near future.
   Secondary effluents, containing high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus,
   need further treatment before being discharged into receiving water
   bodies. At the same time, new environmentally friendly energy sources
   need to be developed. Integrating microalgal cultivation for the
   production of biodiesel feedstock with the treatment of secondary
   effluent is one way of addressing both issues. This article provides a
   comprehensive review of the latest progress in microalgal cultivation in
   secondary effluent to remove pollutants and accumulate lipids.
   Researchers have discovered that microalgae remove nitrogen and
   phosphorus effectively from secondary effluent, accumulating biomass and
   lipids in the process. Immobilization of appropriate microalgae, and
   establishing a consortium of microalgae and/or bacteria, were both found
   to be feasible ways to enhance pollutant removal and lipid production.
   Demonstrations of pilot-scale microalgal cultures in secondary effluent
   have also taken place. However there is still much work to be done in
   improving pollutants removal, biomass production, and lipid accumulation
   in secondary effluent. This includes screening microalgae, constructing
   the consortium, making use of flue gas and nitrogen, developing
   technologies related to microalgal harvesting, and using lipid-extracted
   algal residues (LEA).

AB There is a growing interest in developing bio-based biodegradable
   plastics to reduce the dependence on depleting fossil fuels and provide
   a sustainable alternative. Bio-based plastics can usually be produced
   from lipids, proteins or carbohydrates, which are major components of
   microalgae. Despite its potential for algal plastics, little information
   is available on strain selection, culture optimization and bioplastics
   fabrication mechanism. In this review, we summarized the recent
   developments in understanding the utilization of seaweed
   polysaccharides, such as alginate and carrageenan for bio-based
   plastics. In addition, a conceptual biorefinery framework for algal
   plastics through promising components (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates and
   proteins) from microalgae is comprehensively presented. Moreover, the
   reasons for variations in bioplastics performance and underlying
   mechanism of various algal biocomposites have been critically discussed.
   We believe this review can provide valuable information to accelerate
   the development of innovative green technologies for improving the
   commercial viability of algal plastics.

U1 5
U2 16
AB Microalgae are autotrophs and CO2fixers with great potential to produce
   biofuels in a sustainable way, however the high cost of biomass
   production is a challenge. Mixotrophic growth of microalgae has been
   presented as a great alternative to achieve economic sustainability.
   Thus, the present work reports the energetic characterization
   ofS.platensisbiomasses cultivated under autotrophic (A) and mixotrophic
   conditions using cheese whey waste at different concentrations, 2.5
   (M2.5), 5.0 (M5) and 10.0% (M10), in order to analyze the potential
   production of valuable chemicals and bio-oil by TGA/DTG and Py-GC/MS.
   The biochemical compositions of the studied biomasses were different due
   to the influence of different culture mediums. As the whey concentration
   increased, there was an increase in the carbohydrate content and a
   decrease in the protein content, which influenced the elemental
   composition, calorific value, TGA and volatile compounds evaluated by
   Py-GC/MS at 450°C, 550°C and 650°C. Sample M10 had lower protein content
   and formed a smaller amount of nitrogenates compounds by pyrolysis at
   all temperatures evaluated. There was a reduction of 43.8% (450°), 45.6%
   (550°C) and 23.8% (650°C) in the formation of nitrogenates compounds in
   relation to sample A. Moreover, the temperature also showed a
   considerable effect in the formation of volatile compounds. The highest
   yields of nitrogenates compounds, phenols and aromatic and non-aromatic
   hydrocarbons were observed at 650°C. The oxygenated, and N and O
   containing compounds decreased as the temperature increased.
   Hydrocarbons such as toluene, heptadecane and heneicosane were produced
   byS.platensispyrolysis, which makes this biomass attractive for
   production of high quality bio-oil and valuable chemicals. Therefore,
   the results showed that it is possible to decrease the formation of
   nitrogen compounds via manipulation of growth conditions and
   temperature.

AB We have analysed the potential for biofuels from microalgae in the
   Italian biofuels context. This scenario analysis considers alternative
   pathways for the adoption of biofuels from microalgae by the year 2030.
   The scenarios were developed using a probabilistic approach based on
   Bayesian networks, through a structured process for elicitation of
   expert knowledge. We have identified the most and least favourable
   scenarios in terms of the expected likelihood for the development of the
   market of biofuels from microalgae, through which we have focussed on
   the contribution of economic and policy aspects in the development of
   the sector. A detailed analysis of the contribution of each variable in
   the context of the scenarios is also provided. These data represent a
   starting point for the evaluation of different policy options for the
   future biofuel market in Italy. The best scenario shows a 75%
   probability that biofuels from microalgae will exceed 20% of the biofuel
   market by 2030. This is conditional on the improvement and development
   of the technological changes and environmental policies, and of the
   markets for bioenergy and novel foods derived from microalgae.

TI An evolved native microalgal consortium-snow system for the

   and stabilization.
SO Water Research (Oxford)
VL 196
PY 2021
U1 7
U2 126
AB It is necessary to develop sustainable technologies for centrate
   wastewater (CW) and biogas treatment from sludge anaerobic digestion
   (AD) systems in an environmentally friendly and economical manner. The
   microalgae-based bioremediation approach presents a competitive
   alternative due to its capacity for nutrient recovery and carbon
   sequestration. However, process instabilities and operating challenges
   limit its development and implementation largely due to the complexities
   in the CW and biogas. In this study, the evolved native microalgal
   consortium (ENMC) was firstly developed using the gradual stress
   increase method to enhance their adaptation in high ammonium condition.
   The supplementation of local snow (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and biogas into
   CW significantly enhanced ENMC growth through batch tests. Subsequently,
   an integrated ENMC-snow (ENMCS) system was proposed consisting of a
   hydrolysis-acidification reactor (HAR), biogas upgrade reactor, and
   photobioreactor (PBR). The ENMCS system was systematically investigated
   under both batch and semi-continuous operations, by adjusting primary
   process parameters including the fill ratio, feeding time, hydraulic
   retention time (HRT), wastewater pretreatment, and PBR type. It was
   eventually optimized as a 24 h, 70% fermented CW diluted with 30% snow
   water, semi-continuous feeding system with a fill ratio of 50% and HRT
   of 6 d in an open-PBR. Long-term operation (310 days) showed superior
   biomass yield (0.3059  0.0039 g/(L.d)) and nutrient removal efficiencies
   (95.6  0.13% and 90.8  0.44% for NH4+-N and PO43--P removal). Meanwhile,
   biogas was upgraded with an 82.2% CO2 reduction. The economic and
   environmental analysis further demonstrated the ENMCS system as an
   effective alternative for the bioremediation of AD effluents while
   simultaneously producing value-added biomass, especially applicable to
   snowy regions.

AB Induction of oil accumulation in algae for biofuel production is often
   achieved by withholding nitrogen. However, withholding nitrogen often
   reduces total biomass yield. In this report, it is demonstrated that
   Chlorella sorokiniana will not only accumulate substantial quantities of
   neutral lipids when grown in the absence of nitrogen but will also
   exhibit unimpeded growth rates for up to 2 weeks. To determine the
   physiological basis for the observed increase in oil and biomass
   accumulation, we compared photosynthetic and respiration rates and
   chlorophyll, lipid, and total energy content under ammonia replete and
   deplete conditions. Under N-depleted growth conditions, there was a 64%
   increase in total energy density and a 20-fold increase in oil
   accumulation relative to N-replete growth leading to a 1.6-fold greater
   total energy yield in N-depleted than in N-replete cultures. We propose
   that the higher energy accumulation in N-depleted cultures is due to
   enhanced photosynthetic energy capture and conversion associated with
   reduced chlorophyll levels and reduced self-shading as well as a shift
   in metabolism leading to the accumulation of oils.

AB Today, microalgae are considered as an important source for the
   production of biofuels and pharmaceutical products. However, the lack of
   an efficient and economical method for dewatering and harvesting their
   biomass is is an important challenge to achieve this goal. The important
   issue for choosing the harvesting method are species characteristics,
   final product value and energy consumption. Therefore, in this study,
   the effect of flocculation method with pH change technique (range 6 to
   11) using sodium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride on harvesting
   efficiency, and fatty acid content ofDunaliella salinawas tested. The
   results of this study showed that with the addition of sodium hydroxide
   and increasing the pH from 8.2 to 9.8, the flocculation process
   increased upwards from 18 to 90% and then remained constant until: pH
   11. In contrast, increasing hydrogen chloride and creating an acidic
   environment up to: pH equal to 6 had no effect on clot stimulation. The
   highest coefficient of biomass concentration was observed in alkaline
   treatment with pH: equivalent to 9.8 which was 10 times the initial
   concentration (at pH equal to 8.2) the effect of alkaline pH induction
   technique and the centrifuge technique on the fatty acids content of
   biomass was tested. In the next stage, the effect of alkaline pH
   induction technique and the centrifuge technique on the fatty acids
   content of biomass was tested. The analysis showed that the percentage
   of lipid and fatty acids of harvested biomass were significantly
   different from each other. Based on the obtained results, the
   flocculation method by increasing the pH by 9.8 is a simple and
   relatively inexpensive technique with high efficiency and is suitable
   for harvestingDunaliella salinamicroalgae for specific purposes.

AB Main conclusion: It has been proposed that future efforts should focus
   on basic studies, biotechnology studies and synthetic biology studies
   related to algal biofuels and various high-value bioproducts for the
   economically viable production of algal biofuels. In recognition of
   diminishing fossil fuel reserves and the worsening environment,
   microalgal biofuel has been proposed as a renewable energy source with
   great potential. Algal biofuel thus became one of the hottest topics in
   renewable energy research in the new century, especially over the past
   decade. Between 2007 and 2017, research related to microalgal biofuels
   experienced a dramatic, three-stage development, rising, growing
   exponentially, and then declining rapidly due to overheating of the
   subject. However, biofuel-driven algal biotechnology and bioproducts
   research has been thriving since 2010. To clarify the gains (and pains)
   of the past decade and detail prospects for the future, this review
   summarizes the extensive scientific progress and substantial technical
   advances in algal biofuel over the past decade, covering basic biology,
   applied research, as well as the production of value-added natural
   products. Even after 10 years of hard work and billions of dollars in
   investments, its unacceptably high cost remains the ultimate bottleneck
   for the industrialization of algal biofuel. To maximize the total
   research benefits, both economically and socially, it has been proposed
   that future efforts should focus on basic studies to characterize
   oilgae, on biotechnology studies into various high-value bioproducts.
   Moreover, the development of synthetic biology provides new
   possibilities for the economically viable production of biofuels via the
   directional manufacture of microalgal bioproducts in algal cell
   factories.

AB Quantification of carbon flux distribution in the metabolic network of
   microalgae remains important to understand the complex interplay between
   energy metabolism, carbon fixation, and assimilation pathways. This is
   even more relevant with respect to cyclic metabolism of microalgae under
   light-dark cycle. In the present study, flux balance analysis (FBA) was
   carried out for an indigenous isolateChlorellasp. FC2 IITG under
   photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions. A shift in
   intracellular flux distribution was predicted during transition from
   nutrient sufficient phase to nutrient starvation phase of growth.
   Further, dynamic flux analysis (dFBA) was carried out to capture
   light-dark metabolism over discretized pseudo steady state time
   intervals. Our key findings include the following: (i) unlike
   heterotrophic condition, oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and
   Krebs cycle were relatively inactive under photoautotrophic growth; (ii)
   in both growth conditions, while transhydrogenation reaction was highly
   active, glyoxalate shunt was found to be nonoperative; (iii) flux
   distribution during transition period was marked with up regulation of
   carbon flux toward nongrowth associated (NGA) maintenance energy,
   oxidative phosphorylation, and photophosphorylation; (iv) redirection of
   carbon flux from polysaccharide and neutral lipid resulted in up
   regulation of Krebs cycle flux in the dark phase; (v) elevated
   glycolytic and acetyl-CoA flux were coupled with induction of neutral
   lipid during light cycle of the growth; (vi) significantly active
   photophosphorylation in the light phase was able to satisfy cellular
   energy requirement without need of oxidative PP pathway; and (vi) unlike
   static FBA, dFBA predicted an unaltered NGA maintenance energy of 1.5
   mmol g-1DCW h-1.

AB This study explores the challenges facing microalgae biofuel production,
   specifically low lipid content and difficulties with algal cell
   harvesting. The purpose of the research is to investigate the effect of
   seawater content and nanoparticle concentration on freshwater microalgae
   growth and biofuel production. The principal results of the study show
   that increasing the proportion of seawater and nanoparticles enhances
   the lipid content and cell diameter of microalgae, while excessive
   concentrations of nanoparticles and low seawater content lead to reduced
   microalgae growth. Furthermore, an optimal cell diameter was identified
   at a nanoparticle concentration of 150 mg/L. The study also reveals that
   increasing seawater content can decrease zeta potential and increase
   chlorophyllacontent due to the concentration of dissolved organic
   matter. Increasing the seawater content from 0% to 25% decreased zeta
   potential by 1% owing to the instability and aggregation of the cells.
   Chlorophyllafor the 0% seawater was 0.55 which is increased to 1.32 only
   due to the increase in the seawater content. This significant increase
   is due to the concentration of dissolved organic matter in seawater.
   Additionally, the presence of seawater positively affects microalgae
   metabolic activity and biochar yield. The findings of this study offer
   valuable insights into the potential for optimizing microalgae biofuel
   production. The use of seawater and nanoparticles has shown promise in
   enhancing microalgae growth and biofuel yield, and the results of this
   study underscore the scientific value of exploring the role of seawater
   and nanoparticles in microalgae biofuel production. Further research in
   this area has the potential to significantly contribute to the
   development of sustainable energy solutions.

AB Microalgae offer numerous potential applications, however the industrial
   scale-up of algal technology still remains a challenge due to high
   production cost. Optimization of growth conditions and integration with
   waste streams can improve the economic viability of microalgal
   production systems. This study investigated on the optimal growth
   conditions of microalgae Nostoc ellipsosporum cultivated in municipal
   wastewater with the objective of achieving maximum biomass production,
   nutrient removal efficiency and bio-oil yield. The effect of light
   intensity, photoperiod, wavelength, aeration and growth media
   composition were studied. Different formulations of municipal wastewater
   blended with Fog's nutrient were used as growth medium. Optimization of
   growth conditions and acclimatization to wastewater enhanced the biomass
   yield of Nostoc ellipsosporum from 1.42 to 2.9 g L-1, achieving 87.59%
   of nitrogen removal and 88.31% of phosphate removal from wastewater.
   Furthermore, hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass produced bio-oil yield
   of 24.62% at 300°C.

AB Nutrient deficiency induces a variety of cellular responses, including
   an increase in lipid accumulation in microalgae. Nitrogen starvation is
   the most studied deprivation. Here, we determine the effects of
   phosphorus and sulfur limitation on lipid accumulation inChlorella
   vulgaris. A set of 9 experiments were performed, varying the initial
   concentration of these nutrients (set to 0, 50, and 100% of their
   original composition in Bold's basal medium). According to our results,
   the variation of P and S modified the specific growth rate, lag phase,
   and cell generation time. The ratio of 50%P and 0%S significantly
   increased the total lipid concentration. The fatty acid profile was
   dominated by C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1; a considerable increase in C20:5
   was observed with 0%P and 50%S and 0%P and 100%S. Regarding neutral
   lipids, the response surface methodology (RSM) indicates that the
   maximum was observed when S was between 40 and 60% and P was between 95
   and 100%. Therefore, the enhanced production of lipids caused by P and S
   limitation may contribute to the efficient oil production useful for
   algal biofuels.

AB Bioenergy generation from microalgae can significantly contribute to
   climate mitigation and renewable energy production. In this regard,
   several multi-criteria decision-making method were employed to
   prioritize appropriate microalgae culture system for bioenergy
   production. Entropy weight, Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria
   Correlation (CRITIC) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity
   to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) were the employed MCDA method. Fourteen
   microalgae culture systems were selected as a case study, which contain
   teen monoculture and four dual-culture. Initially, through ans in-depth
   review of the literature and expert views, four categories total eight
   indicators were selected as the evaluation indices of the study, namely
   (1) Proliferation: Half growth cycle and Max growth rate, (2) Biomass
   output: Bio-crude yield and Lipid yield, (3) Nutrient utilization:
   residual concentration of total Nitrogen and total Phosphorus, and, (4)
   Stability: coefficient of variation of Bio-crude yield and Lipid yield.
   The result indicated that "Pediastrumsp. &Micractiniumsp." was
   identified as the most bioenergy potential microalgae culture system,
   and the evaluation results of entropy weight method and CRITIC method
   are similar. It is pertinent to note that (1) the entropy weight method
   exhibits lower sample size requirements, (2) the critic method excels
   when dealing with larger sample sizes, and (3) the TOPSIS method
   necessitates the incorporation of appropriate weighting methods to
   ensure credible results. In the application stage, the key indicators
   related to cost can be further included in the evaluation indices.

AB Sustainability, at present, is a prominent component in the development
   of production systems that aim to provide the future energy and material
   resources. Microalgae are a promising feedstock; however, the
   sustainability of algae-based production systems is still under debate.
   Commercial market volumes of algae-derived products are still narrow.
   The extraction and conversion of primary metabolites to biofuels
   requires cultivation at large scales; cost-effective methods are
   therefore highly desirable. This work presents a complete and up to date
   review on sustainability analysis of various microalgae production
   scenarios, including techno-economic, environmental, and social impacts,
   both in large-scale plants for bioenergy production and in medium-scale
   cultivars intended for the production of high added-value chemicals. The
   results show that further efforts in algal-based research should be
   directed to improving the productivity, the development of multi product
   scenarios, a better valorization of coproducts, the integration with
   current industrial facilities to provide sustainable nutrient resources
   from waste streams, and the integration of renewable technologies such
   as wind energy in algae cultivars.

AB Algae-based biofuel developed over the past decade has become a viable
   substitute for petroleum-based energy sources. Due to their high lipid
   accumulation rates and low carbon dioxide emissions, microalgal species
   are considered highly valuable feedstock for biofuel generation. This
   review article presented the importance of biofuel and the flaws that
   need to be overcome to ensure algae-based biofuels are effective for
   future-ready bioenergy sources. Besides, several issues related to the
   optimization and engineering strategies to be implemented for
   microalgae-based biofuel derivatives and their production were
   evaluated. In addition, the fundamental studies on the microalgae
   technology, experimental cultivation, and engineering processes involved
   in the development are all measures that are commendably used in the
   pre-treatment processes. The review article also provides a
   comprehensive overview of the latest findings about various algae
   species cultivation and biomass production. It concludes with the most
   recent data on environmental consequences, their relevance to global
   efforts to create microalgae-based biomass as effective biofuels, and
   the most significant threats and future possibilities.

AB The exploration of microbial communities to efficiently produce biofuels
   has become a critical approach among biochemical processes. Co-cultures
   have been intensively studied to address the limitations in substrate
   utilization by individual strains for the production of other
   bioproducts. Accordingly, many concerns have arisen about the effects of
   this strategy on lipid productivity. Despite the extensive research on
   lipid production by oleaginous microorganisms, co-culture strategy has
   been only well-reviewed in algal species and most of the original
   research has been concentrated on the different nutritional growth modes
   (e.g. heterotrophic and mixotrophic). Moreover, current literature
   indicates scarce information on strategies for the improvement of lipid
   production with other species rather than microalgae. From a systematic
   perspective, this review will highlight co-culture systems existing for
   the improved biomass and lipid productivity, among other species. The
   review first discloses the current state of microalgal assemblies and
   their strategies for lipid production. Subsequently, it summarizes other
   assemblies aimed at lipid production. Finally, it discusses the relative
   advantages and disadvantages and the possibilities to overcome inherent
   challenges.

U2 41
AB Microalgae have high lipid accumulation capacity, high growth rate and
   high photosynthetic efficiency which are considered as one of the most
   promising alternative sustainable feedstocks for producing lipid-based
   biofuels. However, commercialization feasibility of microalgal biofuel
   production is still conditioned to the high production cost. Enhancement
   of lipid accumulation in microalgae play a significant role in boosting
   the economics of biofuel production based on microalgal lipid. The major
   challenge of enhancing microalgal lipid accumulation lies in overcoming
   the trade-off between microalgal cell growth and lipid accumulation.
   Substantial approaches including genetic modifications of microalgal
   strains by metabolic engineering and process regulations of microalgae
   cultivation by integrating multiple optimization strategies widely
   applied in industrial microbiology have been investigated. In the
   present review, we critically discuss recent trends in the application
   of multiple molecular strategies to construct high performance
   microalgal strains by metabolic engineering and synergistic strategies
   of process optimization and stress operation to enhance microalgal lipid
   accumulation for biofuel production. Additionally, this review aims to
   emphasize the opportunities and challenges regarding scaled application
   of the strategic integration and its viability to make microalgal
   biofuel production a commercial reality in the near future.

AB A major challenge for next decades is development of competitive
   renewable energy sources, highly needed to compensate fossil fuels
   reserves and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among different
   possibilities, which are currently under investigation, there is the
   exploitation of unicellular algae for production of biofuels and
   biodiesel in particular. Microalgae have the ability of accumulating
   large amount of lipids within their cells which can be exploited as
   feedstock for the production of biodiesel. The lipid content of
   different species of microalgae can range from 30%-70% of their dry
   weight. In this project a microalgae with lipid content of 60.095% was
   used. This means that 26 gms of oil was obtained from 42 gms of
   microalgae sample from which 17.624 gm of biodiesel (FAME) was found at
   the end of transesterification. Algae biofuels avoid some of the
   previous drawbacks associated with crop-based biofuels as the algae do
   not compete with food crops. The favorable growing conditions found in
   many developing countries has led to a great deal of speculation about
   their potentials for reducing oil imports, stimulating rural economies,
   and even tackling hunger and poverty. Strong research efforts are
   however still needed to fulfill this potential and optimize cultivation
   systems and biomass harvesting.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) uses water under elevated temperatures
   and pressures (200-350°C, 5-20 MPa) to convert biomass into liquid
   "biocrude" oil. Despite extensive reports on factors influencing
   microalgae cell composition during cultivation and separate reports on
   HTL products linked to cell composition, the field still lacks a
   quantitative model to predict HTL conversion product yield and qualities
   from feedstock biochemical composition; the tailoring of microalgae
   feedstock for downstream conversion is a unique and critical aspect of
   microalgae biofuels that must be leveraged upon for optimization of the
   whole process. This study developed predictive relationships for HTL
   biocrude yield and other conversion product characteristics based on HTL
   of Nannochloropsis oculata batches harvested with a wide range of
   compositions (23-59% dw lipids, 58-17% dw proteins, 12-22% dw
   carbohydrates) and a defatted batch (0% dw lipids, 75% dw proteins, 19%
   dw carbohydrates). HTL biocrude yield (33-68% dw) and carbon
   distribution (49-83%) increased in proportion to the fatty acid (FA)
   content. A component additivity model (predicting biocrude yield from
   lipid, protein, and carbohydrates) was more accurate predicting
   literature yields for diverse microalgae species than previous
   additivity models derived from model compounds. FA profiling of the
   biocrude product showed strong links to the initial feedstock FA profile
   of the lipid component, demonstrating that HTL acts as a water-based
   extraction process for FAs; the remainder non-FA structural components
   could be represented using the defatted batch. These findings were used
   to introduce a new FA-based model that predicts biocrude oil yields
   along with other critical parameters, and is capable of adjusting for
   the wide variations in HTL methodology and microalgae species through
   the defatted batch. The FA model was linked to an upstream cultivation
   model (Phototrophic Process Model), providing for the first time an
   integrated modeling framework to overcome a critical barrier to
   microalgae-derived HTL biofuels and enable predictive analysis of the
   overall microalgal-to-biofuel process.

AB Sustainable energy production represents one of the most formidable
   problems of the 21st century, and plant-based biofuels offer significant
   promise. We summarize the potential advantages of using pond-grown
   microalgae as feedstocks relative to conventional terrestrial biofuel
   crop production. We show how pond-based algal biofuel production, which
   requires significantly less land area than agricultural crop-based
   biofuel systems, can offer additional ecological benefits by reducing
   anthropogenic pollutant releases to the environment and by requiring
   much lower water subsidies. We also demonstrate how key principles drawn
   from the science of ecology can be used to design efficient pond-based
   microalgal systems for the production of biodiesel fuels.

AB As one of the promising species of microalgae for biofuel
   production,Chlorella vulgarisCS-42 was cultivated phototrophically in
   two cylindrical photobioreactors with aeration of 5% (v/v) CO2or air for
   13 days to evaluate the effects of CO2supplementation on biomass,
   CO2fixation performance, and biochemical content. Significant increases
   of specific growth rate and total carbon content in biomass resulting in
   a higher CO2fixation rate were found with 5% CO2. The maximum biomass
   concentration, carbohydrate and fatty acid contents with 5% CO2were
   significantly higher than those with air, while carbohydrate
   biosynthesis was most affected as compared to other biochemical
   components. Cytomic analysis revealed a rapid accumulation of neutral
   lipid in the late growth phase with more lipid bodies visualized by
   confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), when nitrate consumption was
   accelerated with CO2supplementation. Gas chromatography mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated that 5% CO2favored the formation
   of C18:2, which led to a decrease in the degree of lipid unsaturation
   (DLU). These results proved that CO2supplementation was one of the most
   efficient methods to significantly prompt the growth of microalgae and
   increase the C/N ratio in the medium, which in turn regulated the carbon
   metabolic flux to enhance neutral lipid and fatty acid production inC.

AB The world has heavily relied on fossil fuels for decades to supply
   energy demands. However, the usage of fossil fuels has been strongly
   correlated with impactful problems, which lead to global warming.
   Moreover, the excessive use of fossil fuels has led to their rapid
   depletion. Hence, exploring other renewable and sustainable alternatives
   to fossil fuels is imperative. One of the most sustainable fossil fuel
   alternatives is biofuel. Microalgae-based biofuels are receiving the
   attention of researchers due to their numerous advantages compared with
   those obtained from other types of feedstocks. Hence, it is essential to
   explore the recent technologies for biofuel produced from microalgae
   species and define the possible challenges that might be faced during
   this process. Therefore, this work presents the recent advancements in
   biofuel production from microalgae, focusing on emerging technologies
   such as those using nanomaterials and genetic engineering. This review
   focuses on the impact of nanoparticles on the harvesting efficiency of
   various microalgae species and the influence of nanoparticles on biofuel
   production. The genetic screening performed by genome-scale mutant
   libraries and their high-throughput screening may assist in developing
   effective strategies for enhancing microalgal strains and oil production
   through the modification of enzymes. Furthermore, the barriers that
   limit the production of biofuels from microalgae are introduced. Even
   though microalgae-based biofuels are perceived to engage with low
   negative impacts on the environment, this review paper touches on
   several environmental issues associated with the cultivation and
   harvesting of microalgae species. Moreover, the economic and technical
   feasibility limits the production of microalgae-based biofuels.

AB The fossil fuels have negative effects on the environment thus in last
   years the concern about the supplies of petroleum has increased,
   therefore the implementation of renewable energies is a necessity, these
   energies also have to be economic and environment-friendly. The
   biofuels, are environment-friendly energy that can be obtained from
   renewable sources as corn, lignocellulose, citrus peel, or from the
   lipids of microorganism as cyanobacteria, genetically modified
   bacteriaEscherichia coliand yeast asYarrowia lipolyticaandRhodosporidium
   toruloides. Both yeasts have the capacity to accumulate 70% of lipid in
   dry biomass, unlikeY. lipolytica, theR. toruloidesaccumulate
   carotenoids, a kind of terpenoid with many applications in pharmaceutics
   and food industries. Moreover, this yeast has the ability to metabolize
   a variety of sugars as glucose, xylose, mannose, and sucrose, while the
   yeastsY. lipolyticandSaccharomyces cerevisiaeare unable to metabolize
   the pentose xylose. TheR. toruloidesalso can tolerate variations in
   temperature and pH reason why is one of the yeast more explored to
   achieve the production of biomolecules as lipids and terpenoids, from
   which is possible to obtain biofuels and biofuels additives. The
   biofuels obtained from yeast, due to its origin, are classified as
   biofuels of third generation, and energetic and structurally are similar
   to fossil fuels, therefore some isoprenoids are used in the aviation
   industry and can be used for diesel engines. In this review, we describe
   some properties of the isoprenoids as precursors of biofuels and
   additives.

AB The wastewater originates from different industrial, municipal, and
   agriculture processes and contains different nitrogen sources, for
   example, nitrate, ammonium, nitrite, and phosphate such as inorganic and
   organic sources. The discharge of high nitrate and phosphate to the
   ecosystem or nearby water bodies can cause eutrophication which
   disbalances the aquatic ecosystem. Furthermore, ingestion of these
   pollutants can cause severe toxicity and disease to humans and animals.
   Thus, from an environmental and social perspective, its treatment is
   essential with no negative impact on the ecosystem. Microalgae are
   fundamental, mixotrophic microorganisms that treat different wastewater
   and utilize nitrate and phosphate in the medium as a source of
   nutrients. Among them, Picochlorum sp., have the potential to remove
   nitrogen and phosphate from wastewater. The biomass produced by
   Picochlorum sp. can be a promising candidate as a sustainable feedstock
   for biofuel and bioproducts formation. Thus, the present review provides
   a brief knowledge and understanding about the concentration of nitrogen
   and phosphate in different wastewater, their negative impacts, and the
   uptake mechanism of microalgae. Furthermore, the review also provides an
   insight into Picochlorum sp., and the effects of different physiological
   and nutritional factors on their growth, wastewater treatment efficacy,
   and biomass for value-added products and biorefinery applications. In
   addition, the review is useful to understand the potential of
   Picochlorum sp. for a tenable wastewater treatment process.

AB Chlorella sorokiniana is one of the most productive microalgal species
   with a high potential for the production of biofuels and other high
   value-added molecules. Many studies have focused on its capability of
   mixotrophic growth using reduced organic carbon and growth pattern shift
   between autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. In this study, we
   investigated growth patterns of a novel isolate, C. sorokiniana G32,
   under mixotrophic growth conditions supplemented with a low level (1.25
   g L-1) and a high level (5 g L-1) of glucose. Physiological,
   transcriptomic (i.e., RNA-seq), and metabolomic (i.e., LC-MS/MS) methods
   were used. We showed that peak growth based on OD680 nm absorbance is
   ~4-fold higher with high glucose vs. low glucose supplementation.
   Photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) in G32 mixotrophic cultures with high
   or low glucose supplementation remains identical to that of G32
   phototrophic growth. We also found that the conversion rate between
   absorbance-based cell density and cell dry weight with high glucose
   supplementation was lower than with low glucose. This suggests that more
   cell biomass is produced under high glucose treatment than with low
   glucose. The result was confirmed via sucrose density gradient
   centrifugation. It is likely that accumulation of high concentration of
   starch may account for this effect. Transcriptomic analysis of G32
   cultures (i.e., via RNA-seq) in response to reciprocal change of glucose
   levels reveals that expression of a subset of differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs) is correlated with the amount of glucose supplementation.
   These DEGs are designated as glucose-specific responsive (GSR) genes.
   GSR genes are enriched for a number of energy metabolic pathways.
   Together with metabolomics data (i.e., LC-MS/MS), we show that under
   high-level supplementation, glucose is preferentially oxidized through
   an oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Collectively, our results
   indicate the mechanism of regulation of glucose assimilation and energy
   metabolism in G32 under mixotrophic conditions with different levels of
   glucose supplementation revealed by transcriptomic and metabolomic
   analyses. We propose that C. sorokiniana G32 has the potential for the
   production of high value-added molecules.

AB Microalgae have emerged as a renewable and sustainable candidate for
   bioenergy production coupled with pollutant removal from wastewater.
   However, costly biomass harvesting, insufficient biomass productivity,
   and energy-intensive extraction methods are major bottlenecks
   restricting their large-scale development. To break through such
   limitations, researchers have focused on the technologies towards
   consolidating microalgal-bacterial consortia, which exhibit numerous
   advantages related to economy, energy, and environment, due to the
   cooperative interactions between microalgae and bacteria. This paper
   recapitulates the most recent work on microalgal-bacterial interaction
   mechanisms, and describes the diverse biotechnological applications of
   microalgal-bacterial consortia. Based on this review, the interaction
   mechanisms cover substrate exchange, cell-to-cell signaling, and
   horizontal gene transfer. Nutrient availability, growth phase, and
   cultivation conditions are major factors affecting their interactions.
   In terms of wastewater treatment, attached microalgal-bacterial
   consortia are economically feasible and technically superior compared to
   suspended microalgal-bacterial consortia. Appropriate carrier,
   bioreactor type, operation mode, operational factor, and further
   perspectives for engineering attached microalgal-bacterial consortia are
   critically assessed. Bacteria play an important role in promoting
   microalgal growth, enhancing bio-flocculation and facilitating cell wall
   disruption, and thus expanding the application potential of microalgal
   biofuel production. The current state of other promising
   biotechnological applications of microalgal-bacterial consortia
   (particularly mitigation of CO2 emissions, microalgal bloom control, and
   electricity generation) and the appropriate strategies to enhance their
   practical applications are discussed. The major challenges to scale up
   microalgal-bacterial consortia and corresponding recommendations for
   further research are also addressed.

AB Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are important elements for global food
   production, but these nutrients cause pollution in water bodies without
   proper management. Furthermore, P is a finite resource with geologic
   reserves that are geographically restricted. Thus, sustainable use of P
   in agriculture has been the subject of much research over the past
   decade. This study jointly examines two examples of potential
   sustainability measures to address nutrient challenges: improved crop
   varieties and use of recycled fertilizers. We tested the effectiveness
   of dried biomass of a freshwater alga (Scenedesmus acutus) as a
   fertilizer with conventional lettuceLactuca sativacv. Conquistador; WT
   (wild-type)] and genetically modified lettuce of the same variety that
   was transformed for improved nutrient-use efficiency type I Arabidopsis
   Vacuolar Pyrophosphatase (AVP1). In greenhouse conditions, we measured
   yield, soil nutrient content and losses, and soil P fractions after
   application of dried S. acutus biomass at different rates, with and
   without supplemental additions of conventional fertilizer. Yield was
   higher with commercial fertilizer compared with algal fertilizer, and
   AVP1 lettuce consistently produced better yield than the conventional
   lettuce with both fertilizer types, although the effect was stronger
   with the algal treatments. Soil P was mostly sequestered in the pools of
   NaHCO3-extractable organic P, NaOH-extractable organic P, and
   HCl-extractable P, which are poorly available. Although the algal
   fertilizer was ineffective in supporting short-term growth, the P was
   retained in the soils, which may improve soil fertility in the long
   term.

AB The production of biodiesel utilizing microalgae has driven innovation
   worldwide, especially trying to overcome the current economic and
   technological limitations of the whole process. Within these efforts,
   the use of wastewater to cultivate oleaginous microalgae or the use of
   dual-purpose microalgae-bacteria-based systems that treat wastewater and
   produce oleaginous microalgae have become an attractive alternative. The
   aim of this work was to evaluate the population dynamics which occurred
   in mixed cultures of Neochloris oleoabundans with other native
   microalgae, in mixtures of a synthetic medium (BBM) and water of an
   urban polluted river. The effect of temperature, nutrient availability
   and the microscopic monitoring of the population dynamics in such mixed
   cultures were carried out. Furthermore, the isolation of the predominant
   consortium of diatoms and the evaluation of its kinetics of growth and
   its capacity for removal of pollutants was also performed. Results
   indicated that such green microalgae only predominated in mixtures
   containing 80% or 60% of the synthetic medium. In mixtures containing a
   volume of the polluted river higher than 40%, other microalgae
   predominated, especially diatoms of various genera. The diatom
   consortium isolated from a 100% of the river's water sampled in spring
   (April), was formed mainly by a population of Nitzchia frustulum and in
   less extent of Navicula sp. It showed a significantly higher specific
   growth rate when cultivated in water from the river, compared to
   cultures in synthetic modified diatom medium (MDM) and at 32°C, compared
   to cultures incubated at 25°C. The consortium was able to remove 95.45%
   and 95.78% of ammonia nitrogen, 60% and 62.5% of nitrates at 32°C and
   25°C, respectively, after 2 days. It also removed 95% of phosphates at
   32°C and 67% at 25°C after 4 days from the polluted river. Diatoms also
   showed significant accumulation of lipids after 10 days of cultivation
   when stained with Sudan III. In conclusion, such diatom consortium
   showed a large potential for being used in a dual-purpose system that
   could treat the water from polluted streams and that could produce lipid
   rich biomass.

AB The development of high-throughput technology using RNA-seq has allowed
   understanding of cellular mechanisms and regulations of bacterial
   transcription. In addition, transcriptome analysis with RNA-seq has been
   used to accelerate strain improvement through systems metabolic
   engineering. Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, a photosynthetic
   bacterium, has remarkable potential for biochemical and biofuel
   production due to photoautotrophic cell growth and direct CO2
   conversion. Here, we performed a transcriptome analysis of S. elongatus
   PCC 7942 using RNA-seq to understand the changes of cellular metabolism
   and regulation for nitrogen starvation responses. As a result,
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and functionally
   categorized. With mapping onto metabolic pathways, we probed
   transcriptional perturbation and regulation of carbon and nitrogen
   metabolisms relating to nitrogen starvation responses. Experimental
   evidence such as chlorophyll a and phycobilisome content and the
   measurement of CO2 uptake rate validated the transcriptome analysis. The
   analysis suggests that S. elongatus PCC 7942 reacts to nitrogen
   starvation by not only rearranging the cellular transport capacity
   involved in carbon and nitrogen assimilation pathways but also by
   reducing protein synthesis and photosynthesis activities.

AB The limitations of oil reserves and oil and oil derivatives usages
   concerns the world in ambiental, social and economical situation.
   Renewable energy sources, like biofuels, has been seen as a great
   sustainable alternative. Biodiesel has gained attention. It is produced
   in Brazil through the use of different oilseed plant species like castor
   bean, canola, sunflower, peanut and specially soy bean. However, there
   are limitations concerning to the plant crop and usage. Microalgae is a
   promising option compared to these oilseed plants, because their low
   cost crop and transport, lower water consumption, implantation area
   smaller related to others plant cultures. Besides biodiesel. The oil
   extracted from microalgae, has many potentials, among them their use in
   pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food supplements industries, and others. In
   this project, fresh water microalgae probes captured in the central lake
   of Matao-SP were grown in culture media with growing stimulus
   conditions, isolated and identified, and its oils were characterized as
   a potential source to biodiesel future production.

AB Microalgae biomass has attracted attention as a feedstock to produce
   biofuels, biofertilizers, and pigments. However, the high production
   cost associated with cultivation and separation stages is a challenge
   for the microalgae biotechnology application on a large scale. A
   promising approach to overcome the technical-economic limitations of
   microalgae production is using wastewater as a nutrient and water source
   for cultivation. This strategy reduces cultivation costs and contributes
   to valorizing sanitation resources. Therefore, this article presents a
   comprehensive literature review on the status of microalgae biomass
   cultivation in wastewater, focusing on production strategies and the
   accumulation of valuable compounds such as lipids, carbohydrates,
   proteins, fatty acids, and pigments. This review also covers emerging
   techniques for harvesting microalgae biomass cultivated in wastewater,
   discussing the advantages and limitations of the process, as well as
   pointing out the main research opportunities. The novelty of the study
   lies in providing a detailed analysis of state-of-the-art and potential
   advances in the cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, with a special
   focus on the use of wastewater and implementing innovative strategies to
   enhance productivity and the accumulation of compounds. In this context,
   the work aims to guide future research concerning emerging technologies
   in the field, emphasizing the importance of innovative approaches in
   cultivating and harvesting microalgae for advancing knowledge and
   practical applications in this area.

AB Geographic Information System (GIS) tools have been used to
   strategically locate bioenergy facilities and optimize the relationship
   between biomass supply and demand, aiming to minimize overall fuel
   production costs. Microalgae, also termed third generation bioenergy
   feedstocks, are discussed for their potential to meet future energy
   demands. This study reviews literature on GIS applications to locate
   algae cultivation sites and estimate algae biofuel potential. To
   highlight the diversity of results, a quantitative comparison for the US
   studies is presented. We found two major assumptions that primarily
   limited the algae biofuel production potential estimates: (1) the
   production technology (open pond or photobioreactor), and (2) the number
   and type of resources considered, such as land type, CO2, water source,
   water quality, etc. All studies used binary (a location is either
   unsuitable or suitable) suitability models to determine areas for algae
   production. Most studies considered water, land, and CO2resources, while
   some also accounted for infrastructure, soil properties, and work force
   requirements. We found that potential cultivation area in the USA is
   most sensitive to the constraints of CO2availability and land cost. This
   review explains the wide range of algal biofuel potential estimates
   (from 0.09 to over 600 billion L yr-1) by identifying underlying
   assumptions, methodologies, and data. The highly variable outputs
   indicate the need for a comprehensive analysis of different criteria
   individually and in combination to estimate realistic biofuel potential.
   The results suggest that with models becoming increasingly detailed in
   considering resources and conversion/production technologies, further
   decrease in estimated theoretical production potential is expected under
   available technology.

   researchers. This work optimized direct transesterification of dry
   biomass ofChoricystis minorvar.minorusing H3PO4and KOH as catalysts. The
   acid reaction conditions were optimized by Box-Behnken design and the
   base catalysis by 32factorial design with replication. The fatty acid
   methyl ester (FAME) yield was investigated by response surface
   methodology. The H3PO4catalyst was able to convert more than 50% of the
   triacylglyceride into FAME. Applying an analysis of variance, the
   temperature variable was the most significant factor, followed by
   reaction time. The interaction between time and temperature also
   positively influenced the model. The optimum conditions for acid
   catalysis were H3PO4solution 10 mL, 60°C, and 3 h. In base catalysis,
   the model presented a lower statistical significance, with no
   significant differences in FAME content. The base catalysis conditions
   determined were temperature of 30°C for 1 h. The qualitative and
   quantitative profile of FAMEs was similar for both designs evaluated.
   The statistical tool made it possible to optimize the biodiesel
   production by dry microalgae biomass at lower cost, with less labor and
   in less time.

AB One of the main limitations of productivity in photobioreactor is the
   inefficient conversion of the available light into biomass.
   Photoautotrophic cells such as microalgae only absorb a small fraction
   of supplied illumination due to limitation of its photosystem's (PS)
   absorbing rate. However, phenomenon of Flashing Light Effect (FLE)
   allows microalgae to utilize strong light exceptionally through
   intermittent exposure. Exposure of strong light at correct frequency of
   light and dark photoperiod would allow two pigment-protein complexes,
   PSI and PSII to be at the equilibrium mid-point potential to allow
   efficient light conversion. Narrow range of optimum frequency is crucial
   since overexposure to strong light would injured photosynthetic
   apparatus whereas longer dark period would contributed to loss of
   biomass due to triacylglycerol metabolism. The behaviour of microalgae
   towards various illumination conditions of FLE was determined at batch
   Photobioreactor (PBR) by varying the aeration flow rate: 16.94, 33.14
   and 49.28 mL sec-1which yield, respectively the light exposure time of
   3.99, 1.71 and 1.1 seconds per cycle. Maximum cell density in FLE-PBR
   was significantly higher at the exponential phase as compared to the
   continuously illuminated culture (p=5.62*10-5, a=0.05) under the flow
   rate of 25.07 mL sec-1. Maximum cell density yield of FLE-PBR and
   continuously illuminated PBR was, respectively 3.1125*107and
   2.947*107cells mL-1. Utilization of FLE as an innovative solution to
   increase the efficiency of microalgae to convert light into chemical
   energy would revolutionize the microalgae culture, reduce the time for
   cultivation and produce higher maximum biomass density.

   state-of-the-art, opportunities and challenges.
SO Aquacultural Engineering
VL 98

U2 63
AB The wide application of microalgae in health foods, nutritional feeds,
   aquaculture, pharmaceutical extracts, and biofuel production, has
   brought about the advancement of the microalgae cultivation industry.
   However, commercial-scale cultivation of microalgae still faces one
   major challenge, which is its economic feasibility, with lower cost and
   energy consumption. Developing floating photobioreactors to be utilized
   in offshore open water areas has gained more interest recently as it can
   diminish the cost effects of onshore land utilization, while seeking for
   additional benefits, such as regulated temperature, proximity to
   sunlight and nutrient supplies, and integrated ocean renewable energy.
   Thereby, this is timely to explore the potential of floating
   photobioreactors for microalgae cultivation in the offshore region. This
   review deliberately presents the characteristics of offshore
   environments and their potential effects on microalgae cultivation, as
   factors such as location selection, heat capacity, and utilization of
   cultivation resources are significantly different from conventional
   land-based cultivation. Compared to land-based photobioreactors, the
   design of floating photobioreactors has the opportunity to adopt
   hydrodynamical design; by utilizing the external force from ocean waves
   to generate internal liquid sloshing for improving the mixing of
   cultivation medium. While offshore-based microalgae cultivation is
   considerably new as part of blue economy and mariculture, this review
   provides insights into the opportunities for further advancement of
   offshore microalgae cultivation technologies. The encouraging factors
   for hybridization of offshore microalgae cultivation include
   mariculture, carbon dioxide capture and utilization, hydrogen
   production, and ocean thermal energy. Such understandings are vital to
   improving microalgae cultivation in offshore floating photobioreactors
   towards a valuable alternative to the current concerns in developing
   commercial scale of the microalgae industry. Various challenges in
   biological issues, economic and environmental challenges, installation
   and maintenance, as well as destructive hydrodynamic loads are also
   discussed.

AB Microalgae (including cyanobacteria) are promising organisms for
   sustainable products for use as feedstocks for food, feed, fine
   chemicals, and biofuels. They can synthesize a broad range of products
   with medium- to high-value market price such as beta-1,3-glucan
   polysaccharide, single-cell-protein, carotenoids and phycobilin
   pigments, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are
   commercialized in the food industry as dietary supplements and
   functional foods, in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries as
   cosmaceuticals and flavorants, and in the therapeutic field as
   nutraceutical compounds. These microorganisms are also exceptional
   producers of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic,
   docosahexaenoic, and arachidonic acids that have been linked to several
   human health benefits. The aim of this paper is to review the main
   existing high-value products that can be derived from microalgae with a
   particular focus on food science and technology applications. It also
   describes the gross and fine chemical composition of various algal
   species and details the nutritive importance of selected constituents.
   Finally, nutritional quality standards and legislative provisions to
   ensure food safety in the use of algal biomass are presented.

AB Photosynthetic microalgae can capture solar energy and convert it to
   bioenergy and biochemical products. In nature or industrial processes,
   microalgae live together with bacterial communities and may maintain
   symbiotic relationships. In general interactions, microalgae exude
   dissolved organic carbon that becomes available to bacteria. In return,
   the bacteria remineralize sulphur, nitrogen and phosphorous to support
   the further growth of microalgae. In specific interactions,
   heterotrophic bacteria supply B vitamins as organic cofactors or produce
   siderophores to bind iron, which could be utilized by microalgae, while
   the algae supply fixed carbon to the bacteria in return. In this review,
   we focus on mutualistic relationship between microalgae and bacteria,
   summarizing recent studies on the mechanisms involved in
   microalgae-bacteria symbiosis. Symbiotic bacteria on promoting
   microalgal growth are described and the relevance of microalgae-bacteria
   interactions for biofuel production processes is discussed. Symbiotic
   microalgae-bacteria consortia could be utilized to improve microalgal
   biomass production and to enrich the biomass with valuable chemical and
   energy compounds. The suitable control of such biological interactions
   between microalgae and bacteria will help to improve the
   microalgae-based biomass and biofuel production in the future.

AB Renewable biomass sources are organic materials, in which solar energy
   is stored in bio-chemical bonds, and which commonly contain carbon,
   hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen constituents, along with traces of
   sulfur. Renewable biomass is now considered as a crucial energy
   resource, which is able to meet a range of energy requirements,
   including generating electricity and fueling vehicles. Among all the
   renewable energy sources, microalgal biomass is unique, since it
   profitably stores solar energy. It is one of the renewable sources of
   carbon that can be effectively converted into expedient solid, liquid,
   and gaseous biofuels through different conversion techniques. In this
   review, thermochemical conversion technologies involving microalgal
   biomass are highlighted, with emphasis on the background chemistry and
   chemical processes. Thermochemical conversion of microalgal biomass via
   pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, gasification, torrefaction, and
   direct combustion for bioenergy production from microalgal species is
   discussed, though there are limited literature sources available on
   these technologies. The unique features of hydrothermal gasification and
   supercritical gasification technologies are described, with the chemical
   reactions involved in these processes. The decomposition pathways of the
   main chemical components present in the microalgal biomass, such as
   carbohydrates and proteins, are well elucidated with the chemical
   pathways. The pros and cons of direct combustion are also spotlighted.

AB Microalgae possess the potential to produce bio-oils, carbohydrates,
   protein, amino acids and other value added products, each of which
   increase its value as a crop. Unfortunately, proven systems do not yet
   exist for commercial scale production. System designs have generally not
   adequately accounted for water and energy use at scale, as well as
   byproduct markets, and thus yielded systems that are both unaffordable
   and unsustainable. We address energy and water use by presenting a
   straightforward microalga-to-bio-oil production process and then
   characterize system performance using steady-state water and energy
   balances. Practical limitations to commercial production of bio-oils
   from photosynthetic microalgae are proposed and conclusions drawn
   regarding system potential for assumed biomass productivities. As this
   is a theoretical analysis of a generic process and in practice many of
   the bottlenecks presented remain to be solved, it is our intent that the
   analysis framework presented herein can be applied to future systems
   that propose such solutions.

AB Microalgae are feedstocks for production of carbon-neutral biofuels.
   Efforts have been performed to market microalgae biofuels, yet the
   production of microalgae biofuel remains a challenge due to the high
   production cost and low product yield. In particular, lipid extraction
   is a critical step to be optimized. Here, we review lipid extraction
   technologies and cell lysis strategies. Extraction techniques involve
   solvents such as organic solvents, supercritical fluids, ionic liquids,
   deep eutectic solvents and switchable solvents. Advantages and
   shortcomings of solvents are discussed. Besides, strategies have been
   designed to reduce power costs by integration of unit operations in
   downstream processing. We present single-step processes for simultaneous
   cell lysis and lipid extraction, such as ultrasound-, microwave-,
   bead-beating-, surfactant- and pulsed electric field-assisted
   extractions. The lipid extraction yield is enhanced by incorporating
   cell disruption into the lipid extraction process.

AB Microalgae have gained increased attention as a viable, eco-friendly and
   alternative source of green bioenergy. To compete in the fuel market,
   saline microalgae cultivation for biofuel production would need to be
   economically sustainable and co-cultivation of saline microalgae using
   only saline water and recycled nutrient can potentially be the best
   solution to reduce the excessive use and prompt downsizing of natural
   resources like fresh water and fertilizers. This review provides a
   critical analysis on the selection of potential biofuel producing
   marine, halotolerant and halophilic microalgae. Here we proposed a
   microalgae co-cultivation strategy from seawater salinity (35 ppt) to
   salt saturation (300 ppt) with biofuel as the main output. We focused
   that adaptation of a co-cultivation strategy could reduce 95%, 74% and
   51% of the overall nutrient waste compared to the monoculture of marine,
   halotolerant and halophilic microalgae. This paper also highlights a
   cultivation strategy using both mono and mixed culture over the period
   of increased saline condition and compares mass industrial-scale biofuel
   production from microalgae in three sites in Western Australia.

AB Due to the depletion of fossil fuels and their environmental issues, it
   is necessary to find energy resources which are renewable. Algal biomass
   becomes promising feedstock for bio-fuel production. They are considered
   as sustainable, renewable and effective biomass and bio-fuels obtained
   from them are more environment-friendly than fossil fuels. The aim of
   this work is to provide a state of the art review on pyrolysis of
   microalgae for generation of bio-fuels. Initially, some general aspects
   of biomass such as microalgae characteristics, different thermochemical
   processes and advantages of microalgae pyrolysis to produce bio-fuels
   are discussed. Then, different pyrolysis methods are explained and
   parameters affecting the process are addressed. Bio-fuels including
   gaseous, solid and liquid products have been characterized in a separate
   section. Finally, the technical challenges associated with microalgal
   pyrolysis commercialization are discussed in the last section of this
   article.

AB Microalgae hold great promises as sustainable cellular factories for the
   production of alternative fuels, feeds, and biopharmaceuticals for human
   health. While the biorefinery approach for fuels along with the
   coproduction of high-value compounds with industrial, therapeutic, or
   nutraceutical applications have the potential to make algal biofuels
   more economically viable, a number of challenges continue to hamper
   algal production systems at all levels. One such hurdle includes the
   metabolic trade-off often observed between the increased yields of
   desired products, such as triacylglycerols (TAG), and the growth of an
   organism. Initial genetic engineering strategies to improve lipid
   productivity in microalgae, which focused on overproducing the enzymes
   involved in fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis or inactivating competing
   carbon (C) metabolism, have seen some successes albeit at the cost of
   often greatly reduced biomass. Emergent approaches that aim at modifying
   the dynamics of entire metabolic pathways by engineering of pertinent
   transcription factors or signaling networks appear to have successfully
   achieved a balance between growth and neutral lipid accumulation.
   However, the biological knowledge of key signaling networks and
   molecular components linking these two processes is still incomplete in
   photosynthetic eukaryotes, making it difficult to optimize metabolic
   engineering strategies for microalgae. Here, we focus on nitrogen (N)
   starvation of the model green microalga,Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to
   present the current understanding of the nutrient-dependent switch
   between proliferation and quiescence, and the drastic reprogramming of
   metabolism that results in the storage of C compounds following N
   starvation. We discuss the potential components mediating the
   transcriptional repression of cell cycle genes and the establishment of
   quiescence in Chlamydomonas, and highlight the importance of signaling
   pathways such as those governed by the target of rapamycin (TOR) and
   sucrose nonfermenting-related (SnRK) kinases in the coordination of
   metabolic status with cellular growth. A better understanding of how the
   cell division cycle is regulated in response to nutrient scarcity and of
   the signaling pathways linking cellular growth to energy and lipid
   homeostasis, is essential to improve the prospects of biofuels and
   biomass production in microalgae.

AB Driven by policies aimed at enhancing energy security and mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions, the production and use of biofuels have
   significantly increased in recent years. Microalgae owing to its
   multiple advantages which include high lipid content, sustainable
   biomass production, effective land and water utilization are the most
   potential biofuel feedstock that can provide drop-in fossil fuel
   replacements without stimulating competition for agricultural resources
   and are considered to be more environmentally benign than the first- and
   second-generation biofuel feedstocks. However, there are many existing
   technical and scientific impediments that are yet to be resolved.
   Keeping this in view, the present review provides a concise account of
   the microalgal species known to accumulate high levels of lipid and
   describes the main factors that should be taken into consideration while
   selecting suitable algal strains for mass cultivation. The underlining
   advantages and limitations of raceway pond and photobioreactor
   cultivation systems are also examined. The recent advances in genetic
   engineering of microalgae to improve biomass and lipid productivity are
   then highlighted, which include the ongoing debate over the biosafety
   issues pertinent to the use of genetically modified algae. Furthermore,
   a wide range of high-value products that can be co-produced from
   microalgae have been discussed. The review concludes with a
   comprehensive summary of the major techno-economic constraints to
   commercialization of algal-derived biofuels along with promising methods
   for overcoming these challenges in order to produce cost-competitive and
   environmentally sustainable biofuel.

AB Various paper, oil, leather and textile industries generates a large

   the environment which causes severe health hazards to all living
   organisms. Residual dyes generated from textile industries are released
   into the water bodies causes environmental disbalance by getting
   accumulated in aquatic animals and plants causing death. Many times,
   this polluted water is used for agriculture purposes and reaches humans
   through biomagnification and bioaccumulation processes. Synthetic dyes
   are widely used in the textile industries, when comes in contact with
   humans via food chain or physical contact causes cancer and genetic
   mutation. The harmful colour effluent from the textile industries could
   be managed by various physicochemical and biological methods such as
   oxidation, phytoremediation, coagulation, or precipitation, using
   microbial consortium, membrane filtration, chemical, microalgal
   consortium, enzymatic bioremediation, and adsorbents such as biochar or
   microbes before releasing into nature. This review focuses on biochar as
   a viable resource for pollutant removal, climate mitigation, soil and
   water enhancement and bioethanol production improvement. Its efficiency
   levels and economic value can also be manipulated by the arrangement of
   these conditions. We have also discussed different types of dyes used in
   various industrial and their toxicity. Further, the management of
   industrial waste effluents containing dyes using agroindustrial
   waste-derived biochar is discussed in detail. Moreover, other
   applications of biochar and recent advancements on dye adsorption using
   biochar are reviewed.

AB Microalgae polycultures can be shown greater productivity than those
   that characterize monocultures. Nonetheless, rapid and ready
   identification of optimal microalgae combinations for highly productive
   polyculture systems remains a challenge. By assessing the corresponding
   nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies, this study aimed to
   identify microalgal combinations that might improve productivity. Ten
   high-biomass-producing microalgal species in municipal sewage habitats
   were cultivated in an artificial municipal sewage. Four high-yielding
   microalgae, which additionally showed complementary nitrogen and
   phosphorus nutrient utilization preferences, were selected for a
   subsequent dual-culture experiment. The D41 dual-culture system
   comprising Pediastrum sp. and Micractinium sp., showed the highest
   biocrude yield, at 17.5 mg/L/d, which was 13% and 69% higher than those
   of A4 and A1, respectively. Additionally, D41 showed the highest total
   phosphorus removal rate from artificial sewage, which was 27% higher
   than that of Pediastrum sp. monoculture (A4) and 22% higher than that of
   the Micractinium sp. monoculture (A1). Therefore, this study
   demonstrated that, (a) biomass production and nitrogen and phosphorus
   utilization rates of the constructed microalgae dual-culture systems
   were higher than those of monocultures, (b) phosphorus was identified as
   the limiting nutrient for further enhancing microalgae productivity, and
   (c) the dual-culture system showed intermediate characteristics between
   those of the constituent monoculture systems, suggesting that microalgae
   can influence community structure. Through the development of adequate
   software packages that can integrate microalgae nutrient utilization
   preference of and microalgae community structure, future research will
   enable the development of more productive microalgae culture
   combinations.

AB Sustainable energy is the need of the 21st century, not because of the
   numerous environmental and political reasons but because it is necessary
   to human civilization's energy future. Sustainable energy is loosely
   grouped into renewable energy, energy conservation, and sustainable
   transport disciplines. In this review, we deal with the renewable energy
   aspect focusing on the biomass from bioenergy crops to microalgae to
   produce biofuels to the utilization of high-throughput omics
   technologies, in particular proteomics in advancing our understanding
   and increasing biofuel production. We look at biofuel production by
   plant- and algal-based sources, and the role proteomics has played
   therein.

AB Development of renewable and clean energy as well as bio-based fine
   chemicals technologies are the keys to overcome the problems such as
   fossil depletion, global warming, and environment pollution. To date,
   cultivation of microalgae using wastewater is regarded as a promising
   approach for simultaneous nutrients bioremediation and biofuels
   production due to their high photosynthesis efficiency and environmental
   benefits. However, the efficiency of nutrients removal and biomass
   production strongly depends on wastewater properties and microalgae
   species. Moreover, the high production cost is still the largest
   limitation to the commercialization of microalgae biofuels. In this
   review paper, the state-of-the-art algae species employed in livestock
   farm wastes have been summarized. Further, microalgae cultivation
   systems and impact factors in livestock wastewater to microalgae growth
   have been thoroughly discussed. In addition, technologies reported for
   microalgal biomass harvesting and CO2mass transfer enhancement in the
   coupling process were presented and discussed. Finally, this article
   discusses the potential benefits and challenges of coupling nutrient
   bioremediation, CO2capture, and microalgal production. Possible
   engineering measures for cost-effective nutrients removal, carbon
   fixation, microalgal biofuels and bioproducts production are also
   proposed.

AB The exploitation of innate microbial capacities and/or the importation
   of novel diverse biosynthetic pathways have become one of the
   predominant research directions, with both being used to convert
   fermentable substrates into higher-order biofuels with long carbon
   chains (>6) approximating those of gasoline with rating octane value.
   However, one of the primary issues has been which microorganic
   biosynthetic platform is most appropriate for transformation into an
   efficient cell factory for the production of higher-order biofuels. It
   is indistinct whether such a microorganism would ultimately be
   engineered using a native, newly isolated strain, a recombinant strain,
   or a model organism as the starting host. Different biosynthetic
   platforms microorganisms naturally have different genetic backgrounds,
   thus presenting different levels of complexity for metabolic networks,
   the incorporation of different physiological characteristics, cell
   structural properties, and/or biological activities. These complexities
   affect strategic formulations of synthetic biology, optimization designs
   of systems metabolic engineering, selection of metabolic pathways, and
   operation process difficulties in the realm of evolutionary engineering
   at the systems level. Here, we offer a global review of existing
   research for selected, engineered microorganisms designed to produce
   higher-order biofuels. Our focus on these microorganisms centers on the
   optimal production of higher-order biofuels using the construction of
   novel metabolic pathways and/or the alteration of existing pathways as
   well as examples of their application in recent years. We also discuss
   potential candidate microorganic biosynthetic platform and offer insight
   into the circumstances under which each should be used. Finally, we
   highlight the perspective that developing microorganisms has great
   possibility, but has not been extensively explored as a viable platform.
   In this paper, the review is placed in contrast with Crispr-Cas9 genome
   editing technology that will play an increasingly important role, which
   can be used to overcome the complex genetic metabolic background of
   microorganisms at more advanced levels.

U1 5
U2 60
AB Pursuing research on renewable energy is a key challenge in this century
   due to worldwide increase in energy demand and environmental issues
   associated with fossil fuel consumption. In this sense, microalgae have
   received considerable renewed attention to become a feedstock for
   large-scale biofuel production. However, high cost of large algal
   cultivation systems precludes it from currently being an economically
   viable option. In other words, to lower the cost, the harvestable
   biomass energy yield, which is a function of productivity, energy
   content and harvestability of biomass, must be maximized. Therefore, any
   practical method that could improve these parameters would be beneficial
   and contribute to enhancement of the biomass energy yield and is
   interesting for further consideration. Hence, this study aims to review
   parameters influencing the harvestable biomass energy yield in
   microalgal cultures particularly wastewater-fed cultures and to discuss
   the advantages and limitations of different practical strategies in
   order to promote low-cost energy production from microalgal cultures.
   Five practical strategies were considered: CO2addition, variation of
   hydraulic retention time, cultivation and dominance of colonial species,
   zooplankton control and algal recycling. Advantages and drawbacks of
   these parameters were assessed, and it is concluded that of these
   parameters, CO2addition and its combination with algal recycling have
   the higher impact on the enhancement of the harvestable biomass energy
   yield.

AB Cultivation of Chlorella zofingiensis and nutrients removal in dairy
   wastewater were investigated in bench-scale outdoor ponds in winter,
   South China. The impacts of the two types of pH regulations, 56% CO2 and
   acetic acid (HAc) on this process were studied. After 6 days
   cultivation, the removal rates of total nitrogen (TN) and orthophosphate
   (PO43-) using CO2 regulation were better than those using HAc. The
   removal rates of and TN were 97.5% and 51.7%, respectively using CO2
   regulation; 79.6% (TN) and 42.0% (PO43-) were obtained using HAc
   regulation. Higher biomass, protein, sugar content, and stable pH
   control were found using CO2 regulation. However, significantly higher
   lipid content (31.8%) was observed using HAc regulation. The dominant
   differences of fatty acids were the content of C18:1 and C18:3. The
   growth characteristics and environmental conditions especially during
   the typical logarithmic phase were also analyzed.

U2 86
AB Third generation biomass, i.e. microalgae, has emerged as a promising
   alternative to first and second generation biomass for biohydrogen
   production. However, its utilization is still low at present, due to
   several reasons including the strong and rigidity of the microalgal cell
   wall that limit the hydrolysis efficiency during dark fermentation (DF)
   and photofermentation (PF) processes. To improve the utilization
   efficiency of microalgal biomass, it is crucial that important aspects
   related to the production of the biomass and the following processes are
   elaborated. Thus, this article provides detailed overview of algal
   strains, cultivation, and harvesting. It also presents recent research
   and detailed information on microalgal biomass pretreatment, and
   biohydrogen production through DF, PF, and co-digestion of microalgal
   biomass with organic materials. Furthermore, factors affecting
   fermentation processes performance and the use of molecular techniques
   in biohydrogen production are presented. This review also discusses
   challenges and future prospects towards biohydrogen production from

   and biomedical applications. This review summarizes the recent knowledge
   about the formation mechanism of NCCs during pyrolysis of microalgae.
   The key technical and biological aspects of microalgae and pyrolysis
   process parameters, which influence the formation of NCCs, have been
   analyzed. The mechanism of formation of NCCs such as indole, pyridine,
   amides, and nitriles during primary and secondary pyrolysis reactions
   are elaborated. It has been emphasized that the pyrolysis conditions and
   the use of catalysts had significant impacts on the yields and
   compositions of NCCs. The available information shows that the
   transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen functionalities during pyrolysis
   are strongly associated with the formation process of NCCs. The
   challenges in the development of pyrolysis technologies for the

AB Microalgae cultivation is booming in agriculture, aquaculture, and
   bioenergy sectors. A wide range of bioactive compounds with attractive
   properties can be produced with microalgae, including pigments,
   vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The biofuel yields from
   microalgae can exceed the yields obtained with energy crops by 10-100
   times. Therefore, such cultivation is promising for the regulation of
   the biosynthesis of microalagae with phytohormones, which can enhance
   the production of high-valued bioproducts. This review reports the
   effect of auxins, abscisic acid, cytokinins, gibberellins, and ethylene
   on microalgal growth and metabolites, as well as the crosstalk of
   different phytohormones. The use of phytohormones is also promising
   because it can also reduce the inputs necessary to grow the selected
   microalgae and maximize the yields.

AB Microalgal biomass has received much attention as feedstock for biofuel
   production due to its capacity to accumulate a substantial amount of
   biocomponents (including lipid, carbohydrate, and protein), high growth
   rate, and environmental benefit. However, commercial realization of
   microalgal biofuel is a challenge due to its low biomass production and
   insufficient technology for complete utilization of biomass. Recently,
   advanced strategies have been explored to overcome the challenges of
   conventional approaches and to achieve maximum possible outcomes in
   terms of growth. These strategies include a combination of stress
   factors; co-culturing with other microorganisms; and addition of salts,
   flue gases, and phytohormones. This review summarizes the recent
   progress in the application of single and combined abiotic stress
   conditions to stimulate microalgal growth and its biocomponents. An
   innovative schematic model is presented of the biomass-energy conversion

AB Engineered mutualistic consortia of microalgae and bacteria may be a
   means of assembling a novel combination of metabolic capabilities with
   potential biotechnological advantages. Microalgae are promising
   organisms for the sustainable production of metabolites of commercial
   interest, such as lipids, carbohydrates, pigments, and proteins. Several
   studies reveal that microalgae growth and cellular storage of these
   metabolites can be enhanced significantly by co-cultivation with
   growth-promoting bacteria. This review summarizes the state of the art
   of microalgae-bacteria consortia for the production of microalgal
   metabolites. We discuss the current knowledge on microalgae-bacteria
   mutualism and the mechanisms of bacteria to enhance microalgae
   metabolism. Furthermore, the potential routes for a microalgae-bacteria
   biorefinery are outlined in an attempt to overcome the economic failures
   and negative energy balances of the existing production processes.

AB Quantification of the calorific content of microalgae is critical in
   studies of energy flow, trophic partitioning, plant/herbivore
   interactions in aquaculture and biomass production for biofuels. We
   investigated the calorific value and biochemical composition ofChlorella
   vulgarisat different phosphorus (P) concentrations (6.0*10-7,
   2.3*10-6and 2.3*10-4mol L-1P). As expected, the control (2.3*10-4mol
   L-1P) supported better growth than P limited treatments. Biomolecules
   like total carbohydrates and lipids accumulated under P limitation,
   which significantly correlated with high calorific values. Lipid class
   composition showed that triacylglycerols were the most accumulated under
   P limited conditions. The calorific value reported under control
   conditions (13.78 kJg-1) was less than those obtained under P limitation
   (30.47-33.07 kJg-1). The highest calorific value with less growth
   retardation was obtained at 2.3*10-6mol L-1P.

AB Microalgae have attracted great attention as a promising sustainable
   resource for biofuel production. In studies aiming to improve lipid
   accumulation, many key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis were
   identified and confirmed, but genetic engineering remains a challenge in
   most species of microalgae. In an alternative approach, various chemical
   modulators can be used to directly regulate the lipid biosynthesis
   pathway, with similar effects to gene overexpression and interference
   approaches, including improving the precursor supply and blocking
   competing pathways. The produced lipid can be protected from being
   converted into other metabolites by the chemicals such as lipase
   inhibitors. In addition, a few chemicals were also demonstrated to
   greatly influence cell growth and lipid accumulation by indirect
   regulation of the lipid biosynthesis pathway, such as increasing cell
   permeability or regulating oxidative stress. Thus, adding chemical
   modulators can be a useful alternative strategy for improving lipid
   accumulation in large-scale cultivation of microalgae.

AB Algal technologies have advanced significantly over the past few
   decades. Biopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, animal feed, and renewable
   energy are among the applications of microalgae that have recently
   attracted significant attention worldwide. In addition to their use in
   modern agriculture, the fascinating group of organisms can also be used
   in human health, as food additives, as they facilitate nutrient
   availability. In recent studies, algal biomass was demonstrated to be
   beneficial in sequestering CO2. A variety of wastewater and industrial
   effluents have been demonstrated to produce algal biomass. However,
   because of its high productivity and potential for accumulating
   significant amounts of lipid, microalgae initially caught the eye of
   scientists as a renewable source of biofuels. By modifying cultivation
   conditions, harvesting, and extracting value-added products, an algal
   biofuel economy is being developed. All value-added products can be
   extracted from algal biomass more efficiently and environmentally
   friendly by utilizing a complete biorefinery approach. This review
   highlights potential research and development areas for microalgae
   biotechnology.

   Omics-based tactics are used for disentangling the regulation and
   network integration for biosynthesis/degradation of metabolic
   precursors, intermediates, end products, and identifying the networks
   that regulate the metabolic flux. Multi-omics coupled with data
   analytics have facilitated understanding of biological processes and
   allow ample access to diverse metabolic pathways utilized for genetic
   manipulations making microalgal factories more efficient. The present
   review discusses state-of-art "Algomics" and the prospect of microalgae
   and their role in symbiotic association by using omics approaches
   including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics.
   Microalgal based uni- and multi-omics approaches are critically analyzed
   in wastewater treatment, metal toxicity and remediation, biofuel
   production, and therapeutics to provide an imminent outlook for an array
   of environmentally sustainable and economically viable microalgal
   applications.

   because of its potential for in-situ biohydrogen production and
   separation. The GS-MBR, as a special membrane bioreactor, enriches
   CO2directly from the headspace of the anaerobic H2fermentation process.
   CO2can be fed as a substrate to auxiliary photo-bioreactors to grow
   microalgae as a promising raw material for biocatalyzed, dark
   fermentative H2-evolution. Overall, these features make the GS-MBR
   worthy of study. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the GS-MBR has
   not been studied in detail to date; hence, a comprehensive review of
   this topic will be useful to the scientific community.

PY 2023
U1 0
U2 0
AB The taxonomic nomenclature for cyanobacteria is constantly under
   revision as the new technology emerges. Scientists, at first, based
   classification solely upon appearance. Later, it was found, through
   DNA-DNA hybridization or DNA sequencing, that some of these were
   genetically not the same species. A study conducted by the authors of
   this chapter aims to identify one such species that has been revised
   through the years:Phormidium treleaseiGomont. This species is currently
   accepted asLeptolyngbya treleasiiGomont, as of 1988, by Anagnostidis and
   Komarek. This reclassification was solely based on descriptions of
   collections found in Poland (Starmach, 1966) and Austria (Claus, 1961),
   and therefore is not reliable, since the original location, where it was
   found (Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1897) was not resampled or redescribed.
   This location was sampled again starting in 2021 by the authors of this
   chapter to determine what genus it belongs to through a polyphasic
   analysis, and to document the associated cyanobacteria and other thermal
   microbes. Since these organisms rely on a community structure to
   survive, it is important to study all organisms' presence to determine
   their respective roles. Biofilm is a structure that some bacteria can
   form. It is a thin and strong net of filaments, often made up of
   multiple species of cyanobacteria and bacteria. The production of the
   biofilm has been explored by scientists in producing more natural
   polymers and biofuels. ThePhormidiumandLeptolyngbyagenera are two that
   can produce such a film. Eforts to create a polymer from the
   biofilm-making species collected are being explored. The community
   structure of biofilms and mats often change due to abiotic and biotic
   factors. Studying the seasonal growth of the microbes, as well as
   measuring pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen content in Display
   Springs is important for a better understanding of the effects of these
   factors on microbes in thermal alkaline mineral springs. Included in
   this chapter is a review of past and present taxonomic views for
   cyanobacteria, the history ofPhormidium treleasei, factors influencing
   growth of cyanobacteria in Display Springs, and possible
   biotechnological applications for this type species.

   ethanol, and the demand for fermentative biobutanol production has
   renewed interest. The main challenge faced in biobutanol production is
   the availability of feedstock. Using conventional agricultural biomass
   as feedstock is controversial and less efficient, while microalgae, the
   third generation feedstock, are considered promising feedstock for
   biobutanol production due to their high growth rate and high
   carbohydrates content. This review is primarily focused on biobutanol
   production by using carbohydrate-rich microalgal feedstock. Key
   technologies and challenges involved in producing butanol from
   microalgae are discussed in detail and future directions are also
   presented.

AB Global warming, depleting energy reserve and raising demand have created
   a upsurge for alternative and environmentally friendly renewable energy
   sources. Currently, microalgae have recognized as a promising biofuel
   feedstock's due to the several unique characteristics includes high
   productivity, no competition for arable land, fresh water and high CO2
   sequestration efficiency. High caloric value, low density and low
   viscosity make it promising source of renewable energy. They also serve
   the dual purpose of biofuel production along with the production of
   potentially valuable biomass, which could be utilize for
   phyco-remediation, food, animal feeds, fertilizers, drugs etc. In spite
   of huge opportunity, only few algae species were investigated till date.
   This review paper presents the brief view on the potential of microalgae
   for biofuel feedstock, different culturing system, algal conversion
   technology. In addition, hurdles in commercialization of algal based
   biofuel technology and strategies were also discussed.

AB Environmental pollution and freshwater crisis are the main pushing
   forces for upgrading new insights in wastewater treatment . Wastewater
   generated from different sources is an abundant source of various
   nutrients; their recovery could be a better perspective to compensate
   for the demands of the increasing population. Physicochemical or
   bacterial wastewater treatment processes are inefficient in removing
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), are highly energy demanding, and
   generate secondary sludge . Microalgae offer a better alternative in
   wastewater treatment because they can consume different inorganic
   components in wastewater, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and some
   metals for growth and biomass production . They accomplish pollutants
   removal coupled with the production of valuable biomass for the
   generation of bioenergy and commercial products in an eco-friendly
   manner. The present review focuses on the details of different types of
   wastewater along with various challenges of microalgal cultivation
   systems applied in wastewater treatment. The improvements and recent
   advances in the remediation of wastewater involving microalgae are
   discussed. Different microalgal growth models and photorespirometry to
   assess the overall functioning of microalgae in wastewater are also
   summarized. Furthermore, various industrially important products that
   can be sustainably obtained from microalgal biomass through wastewater
   bioremediation are also highlighted. Finally, future perspectives in
   this field are presented.

   sequestration of industrial carbon dioxide. This review summarizes the
   pathways available for biofuel production from carbon sequestered algae
   biomass. In this regard, this review focuses on microalgae and its
   cultivation in wastewater with CO2sequestration. Conversion of carbon
   sequestered biomass into bio-fuels via thermo-chemical routes and its
   engine emission properties. Energy perspective of green gaseous biofuels
   in near future. This review revealed that algae was the pre-dominant
   CO2sequester than terrestrial plants in an eco-friendly and economical
   way with simultaneous wastewater remediation. Hydrothermal liquefaction
   of algae biomass was the most preferred mode for biofuel generation than
   pyrolysis due to high moisture content. The algae based fuels exhibit
   less greenhouse gases emission and higher energy value. This review
   helps the researchers, environmentalists and industrialists to evaluate
   the impact of algae based bio-energy towards green energy and

AB Microalgae are considered as the most promising feedstock for biofuel
   production of the future. The most efficient way to produce vast amounts
   of algal biomass is the use of closed tubular photobioreactors (PBR). In
   contrast to open pond systems, closed PBRs provide a controlled
   environment with a high surface-to-volume ratio, regulated inputs and
   outputs, and contamination free growth medium. However, for the
   commercial large-scale (multiple hectares) use of PBRs, economics are
   still critical. One major concern is the heating or cooling requirement
   of the systems since the best algae growth rates are obtained at about
   25-30°C, depending on the specific strain. A dynamic mathematical model
   was developed to simulate heating and cooling energy requirements of a
   horizontal tubular PBR for any desired location. Operating the model
   using hourly weather data as input, heating and cooling loads can be
   calculated early in the planning stage of a project. Furthermore, the
   model makes it possible to compare the operation inside a greenhouse to
   the outdoor operation, and consequently provides fundamental information
   for an economic feasibility study. Simulation of different PBR row
   spaces, tube diameters, lengths and distances between the tubes provides
   essential information for energy studies as well as efficient use of
   space. The best configuration for a specific location can be evaluated
   easily. Preliminary results proved the importance of a simulation model
   and the impact of a sophisticated heat management on economics. Energy
   savings due to an optimized heat management system will eventually
   increase proficiency of the systems, and support a new sustainable
   industry and fuel source to grow further. The model was exemplary tested
   for a virtual 100,000-L photobioreactor located in San Luis Obispo,
   California, USA. Average algae productivity rates of 23 and 67% for
   outdoor and indoor PBR operations, respectively, were obtained before
   providing supplemental cooling or heating for optimal thermal
   environmental conditions.

AB Microalgae accumulate starch and lipid as storage metabolites under

   biorefinery. Omics analysis coupled with enzymatic and genetic
   verifications uncovered a partial picture of pathways and important
   enzymes or regulators related to starch and lipid biosynthesis as well
   as the carbon partitioning between them under nutrient depletion
   conditions. Depletion of macronutrients (N, P, and S) resulted in
   considerable enhancement of starch and/or lipid content in microalgae,
   but the accompanying declined photosynthesis hampered the achievements
   of high concentrations. This review summarized the current knowledge on
   the pathways and the committed steps as well as their carbon allocation
   involved in starch and lipid biosynthesis, and focused on the
   manipulation of different nutrients and the alleviation of oxidative
   stress for enhanced storage metabolites production. The biological and

U2 89
AB Diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists which constitute one of
   the most successful microalgae contributing enormously to global primary
   productivity and nutrient cycles in marine and freshwater habitats.
   Though they possess the ability to biosynthesize high value compounds
   like eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA), fucoxanthin (Fx) and chrysolaminarin
   (Chrl) the major bottle neck in commercialization is their inability to
   attain high density growth. However, their unique potential of acquiring
   diverse carbon sources via varied mechanisms enables them to adapt and
   grow under phototrophic, mixotrophic as well as heterotrophic modes.
   Growth on organic carbon substrates promotes higher biomass, lipid, and
   carbohydrate productivity, which further triggers the yield of various
   biomolecules. Since, the current mass culture practices primarily employ
   open pond and tubular photobioreactors for phototrophic growth, they
   become cost intensive and economically non-viable. Therefore, in this
   review we attempt to explore and compare the mechanisms involved in
   organic carbon acquisition in diatoms and its implications on
   mixotrophic and heterotrophic growth and biomolecule production and
   validate how these strategies could pave a way for future exploration
   and establishment of sustainable diatom biorefineries for novel
   biomolecules.

AB Synthetic biology requires the design and implementation of novel
   enzymes, genetic circuits or even entire cells, which can be controlled

   functional properties in this regard, such as their modular nature and
   their ability to respond to specific external stimuli. These properties
   have led to the widespread exploration of their use as gene regulation
   devices in synthetic biology. In this review, we focus on two major
   types of RNA elements: riboswitches and RNA thermometers (RNATs). We
   describe their general structure and function, before discussing their
   potential uses in synthetic biology (e.g. in the production of biofuels
   and biodegradable plastics). We also discuss their limitations, and
   novel strategies to implement RNA-based regulatory devices in

U2 123
AB Diatoms are a type of microalgae with diverse capabilities which make
   them useful for multiple applications. The abundance of diatoms in water
   bodies facilitates the removal of pollutants from wastewater originating
   from different industries, such as agriculture and other anthropogenic
   sources. The unique photosynthetic, cellular and metabolic
   characteristics of diatoms allows them to utilize pollutants like
   nitrate, iron, phosphate, molybdenum, silica, and heavy metals, such as
   copper, cadmium, chromium, lead, etc., which make diatoms a good option
   for wastewater treatment. In addition, the biomass produced by diatoms
   growth on wastewaters has diverse applications and can, therefore, be
   valuable. This review focusses on the unique capabilities of diatoms for
   wastewater remediation and the capture of carbon dioxide, concomitant
   with the generation of valuable products. Diatom biorefinery can be a
   sustainable solution to wastewater management, and the biomass obtained
   from treatment can be turned into biofuels, biofertilizers, nutritional
   supplements for animal production, and used for pharmaceutical
   applications containing bioactive compounds like EPA, DHA and pigments
   such as fucoxanthin.

AB In her News Feature "Biotech's green gold", Emily Waltz details the
   'hype' being propagated around emerging microalgal biofuel technologies,
   which often exceeds the physical and thermodynamic constraints that
   ultimately define their economic viability. In this letter, the authors
   counter such excessive claims and demonstrate that 22 MJ m-2 d-1 solar
   radiation supports practical yield maxima of 60 to 100 kl oil ha-1 y-1
   (6600 to 10800 gal ac-1 y-1) and an absolute theoretical ceiling of 94
   to 155 kl oil ha-1 y-1, assuming a maximum photosynthetic conversion
   efficiency of 10%. To evaluate claims and provide an accurate analysis
   of the potential of microalgal biofuel systems, the authors conducted
   industrial feasibility studies and sensitivity analyses based on
   peer-reviewed data and industrial expertise. Given that microalgal
   biofuel research is still young and its development still in flux, the
   authors anticipate that the stringent assessment of the technology's
   economic potential presented below will assist R&D investment and policy
   development in the area going forward.

TI Thermo-alkaline pretreatment of lipid-extracted microalgal biomass
   residues enhances hydrogen production.
SO Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology
VL 86

PS 454-460
PY 2011

AB BACKGROUND: The conversion of lipid-extracted microalgal biomass
   residues (LMBRs) into hydrogen serves the dual role in renewable energy
   production and sustainable development of microalgal biodiesel industry.
   In this work, batch experiments were performed to convert LMBRs
   pretreated by a thermo-alkaline method into hydrogen. In addition,
   repeated batch cultivation was conducted using the pretreated LMBRs as
   feedstocks under optimal pretreatment condition to further obtain high
   hydrogen production. RESULTS: The optimal pretreatment conditions for
   LMBRs were NaOH dosage of 8 g L-1, pretreatment time of 2.5 h and solid
   content of 6.7%, which resulted in 160% and 500% improvement in the
   hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate, respectively. In addition,
   it was found that the repeated batch cultivation was a very useful
   method to improve the hydrogen production and hydrogen production rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: The thermo-alkaline pretreatment resulted in remarkable
   improvements in LMBR solubilization, which led to an increase in
   hydrogen production. Repeated batch cultivation was a useful method to
   adapt and enrich hydrogen-producing bacteria that could ferment LMBRs
   with high hydrogen yield.

U1 8
U2 358
AB This review analyzes various algal biofilm reactors used for integrated
   wastewater treatment and biofuel production to overcome the current
   challenges for algal biofuel production. Various reactor configurations,
   support materials and operation strategies of algal biofilm reactors are
   discussed and compared with conventional suspended culture systems in
   terms of algal biomass productivity, nutrient removal, biomass harvest
   and biofuel production. The rotating biofilm reactor among various types
   of biofilm reactors was found to be a promising option to provide high
   biomass productivity and efficient utilization of nutrients in
   wastewater. Some materials such as stainless steel, nylon and natural
   fibers among various materials were found to be highly effective for
   supporting microalgal biofilm. To date mainly municipal wastewater has
   been integrated with algal bioreactors while only a few agricultural
   wastewater have been used for algal bioreactors due to inhibition of
   algal growth with high ammonium concentrations in animal manure and poor
   light delivery with high turbidity of animal manure. Overall, the algal
   biofilm reactors integrated with wastewater would have great potential
   for high productivity of algal biomass and efficient wastewater
   treatment if various conditions are optimized.

   significance.
SO Progress in Lipid Research
VL 96

U1 21
U2 53
AB Plants and algae play a crucial role in the earth's ecosystems. Through
   photosynthesis they convert light energy into chemical energy, capture
   CO2 and produce oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. Photosynthetic
   organisms are primary producers and synthesize the essential omega 3 and
   omega 6 fatty acids. They have also unique and highly diverse complex
   lipids, such as glycolipids, phospholipids, triglycerides, sphingolipids
   and phytosterols, with nutritional and health benefits. Plant and algal
   lipids are useful in food, feed, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical and
   pharmaceutical industries but also for green chemistry and bioenergy.
   The analysis of plant and algal lipidomes represents a significant
   challenge due to the intricate and diverse nature of their composition,
   as well as their plasticity under changing environmental conditions.
   Optimization of analytical tools is crucial for an in-depth exploration
   of the lipidome of plants and algae. This review highlights how
   lipidomics analytical tools can be used to establish a complete mapping
   of plant and algal lipidomes. Acquiring this knowledge will pave the way
   for the use of plants and algae as sources of tailored lipids for both
   industrial and environmental applications. This aligns with the main
   challenges for society, upholding the natural resources of our planet
   and respecting their limits.

AB Microalgal biomass as renewable energy source is believed to be of great
   potential for reliable and sustainable biofuels production. However,
   microalgal biomass production is pinned by harvesting and dewatering
   stage thus hindering the developing and growing microalgae biotechnology
   industries. Flotation technology applied in mineral industry could be
   potentially applied in microalgae harvesting and dewatering, however
   substantial knowledge on different flotation units is essential. This
   paper presents an overview on different flotation units as promising
   cost-effective technologies for microalgae harvesting thus bestowing for
   further research in development and commercialization of microalgae
   based biofuels. Dispersed air flotation was found to be less energy
   consuming. Moreover, Jameson cell flotation and dispersed ozone
   flotation are believed to be energy efficient microalgae flotation
   approaches. Microalgae harvesting and dewatering by flotation is still
   at embryonic stage, therefore extended studies with the focus on life
   cycle assessment, sustainability of the flotation unit, optimization of
   the operating parameters using different algal species is imperative.
   Though there are a number of challenges in microalgae harvesting and
   dewatering, with well designed and developed cultivation,
   harvesting/dewatering, extraction and conversion technologies,
   progressively, microalgae technology will be of great potential for
   biological carbon sequestration, biofuels and biochemicals production.

AB With renewed interest in microalgae due to their potential for biofuel
   and bioproducts production, efficient cultivation and harvesting
   mechanisms are needed to increase the economic competitiveness of
   microalgal products against traditional sources. With pore sizes ranging
   from microns to angstroms, membranes provide tailored functions for
   solid/liquid separation (cell retention, biomass concentration and
   dewatering), gas/liquid separation (gas delivery and removal), and
   solute/liquid separation (bioproduct recovery, feedstock preparation and
   effluent recycling) that are problematic or not possible with other
   technologies. Existing knowledge on membrane systems used in other
   disciplines, such as environmental engineering, marine science, and
   biomedicine, can be applied to algae production. Though membranes have
   great potential to facilitate cultivation and harvesting, challenges in
   energy reduction and fouling mitigation need to be overcome for
   long-term, cost-effective application.

AB The microalgal-bacterial co-cultivation was adopted as an alternative in
   making microbial-based biofuel production to be more feasible in
   considering the economic and environmental prospects. Accordingly, the
   microalgal-bacterial symbiotic relationship was exploited to enhance the
   microbial biomass yield, while bioremediating the nitrogen-rich
   municipal wastewater. An optimized inoculation ratio of microalgae and
   activated sludge (AS:MA) was predetermined and further optimization was
   performed in terms of different increment ratios to enhance the
   bioremediation process. The nitrogen removal was found accelerating with
   the increase of the increment ratios of inoculated AS:MA, though all the
   increment ratios had recorded a near complete total nitrogen removal
   (94-95%). In light of treatment efficiency and lipid production, the
   increment ratio of 0.5 was hailed as the best microbial population size
   in accounting the total nitrogen removal efficiency of 94.45%, while not
   compromising the lipid production of 0.241 g/L. Moreover, the cultures
   in municipal wastewater had attained higher biomass and lipid
   productions of 1.42 g/L and 0.242 g/L, respectively, as compared with
   the synthetic wastewater which were only 1.12 g/L (biomass yield) and
   0.175 g/L (lipid yield). This was possibly due to the presence of trace
   elements which had contributed to the increase of biomass yield; thus,
   higher lipid attainability from the microalgal-bacterial culture. This
   synergistic microalgal-bacterial approach had been proven to be
   effective in treating wastewater, while also producing useful biomass
   for eventual lipid production with comparable net energy ratio (NER)
   value of 0.27, obtained from the life-cycle analysis (LCA) studies.
   Thereby, contributing towards long-term sustainability and possible
   commercialization of microbial-based biofuel production.

AB Biofuel is identified as one of the key renewable energy sources for
   sustainable development, and can potentially replace fossil-based fuels.
   Anticipating the competition between food and energy security, the
   Australian Government is intensively exploring other biofuel resources.
   There have been numerous research projects in Australia using the second
   and third generation model based on different feedstocks including
   lignocellulosic and microalgae. Such projects have been successfully
   demonstrated but are yet to be commercially viable. Moreover, transition
   pathways to realize the potential benefits of these value chains are not
   well understood. This preliminary study tried to provide an alternative
   framework and proposes future long-term transport biofuel pathways in
   Australia which can be seen as a solution for a post-carbon society. The
   study is targeted to outline the milestone of the Australian biofuel
   industry and its roadmap into the future. An investigation has been
   carried out on biofuel status and barrier, technology development,
   market and the chronology of biofuel related policies in Australia to
   understand the current situation and possibilities to develop further
   strategies, while also providing an insight into the consequences of
   producing biofuel for transportation. Several methods have been proposed
   to introduce the transition into a post-carbon society. Seven scenarios
   were divided, covering the roadmap of first, second and third generation
   of biofuel, alternative transportation modes such as electric vehicles
   (EVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and the elimination of the fossil
   fuel running vehicles within a time frame of 20 years. The utilization
   of biofuel can be seen as a short to medium mode for transition into a
   green transportation society. Our investigation also showed that
   microalgae gave a better ecological footprint which offers the strongest
   potential for future Australian biofuel industry and aviation.
   Meanwhile, EVs and FCVs also share the portion for long-term
   transportation modes scenario.

AB Microalgae have shown tremendous potentials as a feedstock for biofuel
   productions. Nevertheless, microalgae utilization is not economically
   sustainable mainly due to the high cost of harvesting. Among existing
   technologies, mechanical-based harvesting methods are considered the
   most effective means of microalgae recovery because these methods are
   highly reliable in separating suspended cultures from the growth medium,
   and they require no additives. To further advance these technologies in
   broader areas, a comprehensive review that covers the performance,
   limitations, and associated costs of these methods is needed. This
   review presents an inclusive assessment of all mechanical-based methods,
   particularly centrifugation and filtration, with a complete evaluation
   of their economic facets. The mechanical-based methods are used as a
   single-step harvesting process or as a sequence of operations for
   increased harvesting efficiency. This study reveals that centrifugation
   offers the utmost cell removal efficiency in a timely manner while
   having the highest capital and operational cost demands (2.18 $/kg
   produced oil). Conversely, the sedimentation process is comparatively
   inexpensive (0.3 $/kg produced oil) and is ideal as the initial step to
   reduce the load on the following steps, although it is a lengthy
   process. Flotation has to be utilized in conjunction with filtration to
   complete cell removal, and it may not be suitable for all agal cultures
   due to the necessity of chemical additives. The use of these additives
   essentially increases the maintenance requirements.

AB Considerable research and development is underway to produce fuels from
   microalgae, one of several options being explored for increasing
   transportation fuel supplies and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
   (GHG). This work models life-cycle GHG and on-site freshwater
   consumption for algal biofuels over a wide technology space, spanning
   both near- and long-term options. The environmental performance of algal
   biofuel production can vary considerably and is influenced by
   engineering, biological, siting, and land-use considerations. We have
   examined these considerations for open pond systems, to identify
   variables that have a strong influence on GHG and freshwater
   consumption. We conclude that algal biofuels can yield GHG reductions
   relative to fossil and other biobased fuels with the use of appropriate
   technology options. Further, freshwater consumption for algal biofuels
   produced using saline pond systems can be comparable to that of
   petroleum-derived fuels.

AB Increases in wastewater discharges and the generation of municipal solid
   wastes have resulted in deleterious effects on the environment, causing
   eutrophication and pollution of water bodies. It is therefore necessary
   to investigate sustainable bioremediation alternatives. Wastewater
   treatment using consortia of microalgae-bacteria is an attractive
   alternative because it allows the removal and recycling of nutrients,
   with the additional advantage of biomass production and its subsequent
   conversion into valuable by-products. The present study aims to
   integrate wastewater and landfill leachate treatment with the production
   of microalgal biomass, considering not only its valorization in terms of
   lipid and carbohydrate content but also the effect of nutrient
   limitation on biomass formation. The effect of treating a mixture of raw
   wastewater with different leachate ratios (0%, 7%, 10% and 15%) was
   investigated using a microalgae-bacteria consortium. Two microalgae
   (Desmodesmus spp. and Scenedesmus obliquus) were used. Nutrient removal,
   biomass concentration, carbohydrate, lipid and Fatty Acid Methyl Ester
   (FAMEs) content and morphological changes were evaluated. Removals of
   82% of NH4+ and 43% of orthophosphate from a wastewater-leachate mixture
   (containing 167 mg/L NH4+ and 23 mg/L PO43-) were achieved. The highest
   final yield was obtained using Desmodesmus spp. (1.950.3 g/L). The
   microalgae were observed to accumulate high lipid (20%) and carbohydrate
   (41%) contents under nutrient limiting conditions. The concentration of
   Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) also increased. Morphological
   changes including the disintegration of coenobia were observed. By using
   a mixture of wastewater-leachate it is possible to remove nutrients,
   since microalgae tolerate high ammonia concentrations, and
   simultaneously increase the algal biomass concentration containing
   precursors to allow biofuel production.

   induce an increased formation of lipid bodies filled with
   triacylglycerol in these cells. Here we review our knowledge base on
   glycerolipid synthesis in the green algae with an emphasis on recent
   studies on carbon flux, redistribution of lipids under nutrient-limiting
   conditions and its regulation. We discuss the contributions and
   limitations of classical and novel approaches used to elucidate the
   algal triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathway and its regulatory network in
   green algae. Also discussed are gaps in knowledge and suggestions for
   much needed research both on the biology of triacylglycerol accumulation
   and possible avenues to engineer improved algal strains.

AB Microalgae have been one of the important sources for biofuel production
   owing to their competitive advantages such as no need to tap into the
   global food supply chain, higher energy density, and absorbing carbon
   dioxide to mitigate global warming. One of the key factors to ensure
   successful biofuel production is that it requires not only
   bioprospecting of the microalgae with high lipid content, high growth
   rate and tolerance to environmental parameters but also on-site
   monitoring of the cultivation process and optimization of the culturing
   conditions. However, as the conventional techniques usually involve in
   complicated procedures, or are time-consuming or labor intensive,
   microfluidics technology offers an attractive alternative to resolve
   these issues. In this review, applications of microfluidics to
   bioprospecting in microalgae biotechnology were discussed such as cell
   identification, cell sorting/screening, cell culturing and cell
   disruption. In addition, utilization of microalgae in micro-sized fuel
   cells and microfluidic platforms for biosensing was addressed. This
   review reports the recent studies and offers a look into how
   microfluidics is exploited to tackle the issues encountered in the
   microalgae biotechnology.

AB Microalgal and lignocellulosic biomass is the most sumptuous renewable
   bioresource raw material existing on earth. Recently, the bioconversion
   of biomass into biofuels have received significant attention replacing
   fossil fuels. Pretreatment of biomass is a critical process in the
   conversion due to the nature and structure of the biomass cell wall that
   is complex. Although green technologies for biofuel production are
   advancing, the productivity and yield from these techniques are low.
   Over the past years, various pretreatment techniques have been developed
   and successfully employed to improve the technology. This paper presents
   an in-depth review of the recent advancement of pretreatment methods
   focusing on microalgal and lignocellulosic biomass. The technological
   approaches involving physical, chemical, biological and other latest
   pretreatment methods are reviewed.

PY 2016
U1 4
U2 127
AB Nowadays, microalgae-based bioenergy has been commonly considered as a
   potential substitute of the non-renewable traditional energy resources
   with increasing attention. Nevertheless, microalgal cells will
   secrete/release some Soluble Algal Products (SAPs) into the culture
   medium during microalgal biomass cultivation. Studies on the influences,
   especially the negative ones, of SAPs in large-scale cultivation of
   microalgae for biomass/bioenergy production remain limited. The negative
   effects, properties, production and treatments of SAPs were therefore
   investigated and summarized in this paper. It was found that SAPs may
   inhibit microalgal growth, raise the cost of microalgal recovery and
   lower the performance of the downstream discharged water treatment
   process after microalgal cultivation, among others. The production of
   SAPs could be as high as 70 mg/L in terms of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), causing substantial environmental issues. The chemical properties
   of SAPs significantly varied among different microalgal species, growth
   phases and nutrient concentrations. The distribution of molecular weight
   of SAPs varied from less than 1 kDa to more than 100 kDa, meanwhile the
   hydrophilic/hydrophobic property of SAPs showed a consistency. All
   studies showed that more than 60% of SAPs are hydrophilic. After
   comparing three different SAPs treatment methods, it was concluded that
   biodegradation could be a feasible and economical process to remove SAPs
   based on the properties of SAPs. The mechanisms of SAPs formation and
   the mitigation of their undesirable effects are still not clear.
   Therefore, a systematic and deep study on those topics is urgently
   needed.

AB The reliance of fossil fuel for industrial and energy sectors has
   resulted in its depletion. Therefore, enormous efforts have been
   considered to move-out from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources
   based industrial process developments. Recently, biohydrogen (bio-H2)
   has been recognised as a clean source of fuel with high-energy
   efficiency, which can be produced via different routes. Among them,
   biological fermentation processes are highly recommended due to
   eco-friendly and economically viable approaches compared to that of
   thermochemical processes. However, the low H2 yield and high production
   cost are major bottlenecks for commercial scale operations. Thus, this
   review proposed an integrated microalgae-based H2 production process,
   which will provides a possible route for commercialization in near
   future. Furthermore, process integration to improve efficiency and
   implementation of advanced strategies for the enhancement of bio-H2
   production, economic viability, and future research needs are discussed.

   for oil production. The cost of oil produced by yeast could further be
   lowered using cheaper agro-waste and biomass as substrate. This review
   focuses on key topics which will help in gaining better understanding to
   enhance lipid production using yeast strains. The effects of oleaginous
   yeast co-culturing with microalgae, different cheap carbon sources of
   biomass, and types of yeast species on oil production were highlighted
   in the review. An overview of mechanisms of oil production from biomass,
   viz. pretreatment of biomass, fermentation and oil recovery are also
   provided. Constraints encountered during the oleogenesis or microbial
   oil accumulation and their probable solutions along with a section on
   different by-products obtained during oleo-genesis are also discussed.

U1 11
U2 87
AB Converting microalgae biomass into bio-oil in hydrothermal condition is
   a suitable and promising way to produce alternative liquid fuel yet
   challenging in high oxygen content of resultant oil product for further
   commercial application. Deoxygenation mechanism in hydrothermal
   condition has significant difference with that in organic solvent due to
   unique physicochemical property of water in sub- and supercritical state
   . Accordingly, this paper reviews recent advances on hydrothermal
   catalytic deoxygenation of microalgal bio-crude oil. The specific role
   of high-temperature water played on deoxygenation process is discussed.
   And the effects of several experimental variables including temperature,
   reaction time, solvent and hydrothermal processing technology on
   deoxygenation are systematically illustrated. Finally, catalytic
   activity and mechanism of metal and acid-based catalysts involved in
   deoxygenation of typical aliphatic and aromatic oxygen-containing model
   compounds under hydrothermal conditions are elaborated as well. This
   review summarizes the process of HDO of microalgae bio-oil from HTL and
   provides a general scientific reference for further studies.

AB Due to the rapid expansion of the global economy and population, there
   aren't enough water resources accessible for direct human consumption.
   Therefore, water remediation will unavoidably take center stage on a
   worldwide platform. The development of microalgae can be supported by
   several types of wastewater (WW). They might be able to clean up
   pollutants from industry and urban effluents. Due to its low energy
   requirements, microalgae's capacity to survive in various environmental
   circumstances, and the potential to convert WW nutrients into high-value
   chemicals, microalgae-based wastewater treatment (WWT) has already
   received attention. Recent studies have reported using microalgae to
   remove pharmaceutical compounds and pesticides from wastewater produced
   by industrial and agricultural processes and removing nutrients from
   wastewater from WWTs. As a result, utilizing microalgae for both
   wastewater treatment and biofuel production could be a cost-effective
   solution to these challenges. This review emphasizes recent developments
   in the production of microalgae for WW cleanup. Additionally, it
   highlights the current problems and opportunities in the emerging
   algae-based sector.

AB Biotechnological application of microalgae cultures at large scale has
   significant potential in the various fields of biofuels, food and feed,
   cosmetic, pharmaceutic, environmental remediation and water treatment.
   Despite this great potential application, industrialisation of
   microalgae culture and valorisation is still faced with serious
   remaining challenges in culture scale-up, harvesting and extraction of
   target molecules. This review presents a general summary of current
   techniques for harvesting and extraction of biomolecules from
   microalgae, their relative merits and potential for industrial
   application. The cell wall composition and its impact on microalgae cell
   disruption is discussed. Additionally, more recent progress and
   promising experimental methods and studies are summarised that would
   allow the reader to further investigate the state of the art. A final
   survey of energetic assessments of the different techniques is also
   made. Bead milling and high-pressure homogenisation seem to give clear
   advantages in terms of target high value compounds extraction from
   microalgae, with enzyme hydrolysis as a promising emerging technique.

AB Industrial effluents such as pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, dyes,
   and metal processes holds abundant value-added products (VAPs), where
   its recovery has become essential. The purpose of such recovery is for
   sustainable treatment, which is an approach that considers the economic,
   social, and environmental aspects. Microalgae with its potential in the
   recovery process from effluents, can reduce energy usage of waste
   management strategies and regenerate nutrients such as carbon,
   phosphorus, and nitrogen. Microalgae cultures offer the use of inorganic
   materials by microalgae for their growth and the help of bacteria to
   produce biomass, thus, resulting in the absence of secondary emissions
   due to its ability to eliminate volatile organic compounds. Moreover,
   recovered bioactive compounds are transformed into bioethanol,
   bio-fertilizers, biopolymer, health supplements and animal feed.
   Therefore, it is significant to focus on an economical and efficient
   utilization of microalgae in recovering nutrients that can be further
   used in various commercial applications.

AB Background and Objective: Oceans are major sinks for the anthropogenic
   CO2and microalgae play a characteristic role in mitigating it. Due to
   the heavily released anthropogenic CO2into the environment, the natural
   phenomena those control the CO2concentration in atmosphere are now not
   sufficient enough to normalise it. This has imparted on a need of novel
   environmental friendly option of CO2sequestration. Cultivating
   microalgae for biofuel can directly consume the industrially released
   CO2and help to reduce the release of anthropogenic CO2, but making this
   CO2available into the liquid medium by artificial mean is the challenge.
   Buffering ability of seawater accelerates the mass transfer of CO2in an
   aqueous phase and can hasten up the removal of anthropogenic CO2.
   Materials and Methods: In present communication salt tolerating
   strainPseudanabaena limnetica(Lemm.)Komarekwas grown in the
   operationally optimized 60 L flat panel photobioreactor containing
   Na2CO3rich Modified Seawater BG11 medium (MSWBG11). Initially,
   CO2dissolution capacity of only seawater and MSWBG11 medium was
   determined. Then the effect of 2 different CO2flow rates viz. <0.001 LPM
   (set I) and <0.005 LPM (set II) on CO2dissolution (DCO2), associated pH
   change and its effect on biomass production in MSWBG11 were studied.
   Results: In the control experiment the DCO2was reduced from 2.08-1.19 mg
   L-1and the amount of dry biomass produced was 1.15 g L-1. In set I the
   DCO2concentration was maintained in the range of 8-15 mg L-1and the
   biomass produced was 1 g L-1. In set II the DCO2remained in the range of
   3.59-4.00 mg L-1and the biomass produced was 1.20 g L-1. Conclusion:
   Thus, feeding of CO2at a lower flow rate was found to be favorable for
   algal growth. Though the mass transfer coefficient (KLa min-1) increased
   at the higher CO2flow rate, the actual percentage of CO2removal was not
   increased.

TI Unlocking pilot-scale green diesel production from microalgae.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 368
PY 2024
U1 1
U2 7
AB Microalgae have emerged as a promising source of biomass to produce
   renewable biofuels due to their ability to synthesize high-energy
   density compounds of commercial interest. This study proposes an
   approach for pilot-scale oil extraction, purification by fractional
   distillation, hydrocarbon characterization by gas chromatography coupled
   to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), evaluation of physicochemical parameters
   of the produced hydrocarbons, preliminary cost analysis, and challenges
   and future opportunities for green diesel on a commercial scale. Here,
   the microalgae Tetradesmus obliquus was cultivated in 12 m3
   photobioreactors using biodigested swine waste as a culture medium. The
   resulting biomass was subjected to drying and harvesting, followed by
   oil extraction using a hot solvent extraction method, followed by
   distillation to purify the compounds. Three different extraction and
   distillation experiments were conducted, each using different solvent
   combinations. The results obtained revealed that extraction with a
   solvent blend, composed of hexane and ethanol, provided more significant
   yields compared to extraction with pure hexane. GC-MS analysis showed
   the presence of alkanes and alkenes in the oil samples, and the
   proportion of solvent used in the extraction directly influenced the
   production of alkanes. Additionally, specific hydrocarbons such as
   4-methyl-1-decene, 8-heptadecene, 1-pentadecene, 9-heneicosene, and
   2-dodecene were identified. The evaluation of the physicochemical
   parameters demonstrated that the calorific value of the distilled oil
   samples is within the range of typical values for petroleum diesel.
   However, it was observed that the distilled oil samples had higher
   sulfur content compared to conventional diesel. Regarding the cost
   analysis, it was found that it varies depending on the experimental
   conditions. In particular, the process using a solvent mixture of 70%
   hexane and 30% ethanol proved to be more economical than the others,
   since it extracted a greater quantity of oil with a lower initial
   biomass requirement. In summary, this microalgae-derived hydrocarbon
   production process is promising and offers insights for compound
   purification and future biofuel applications.

AB Microalgae have received great attention as a source of bioenergy
   production and potential for industrial effluent remediation. Malaysian
   palm oil industry is discharging a huge amount of industrial effluent in
   the form of palm oil mill effluent (POME) containing a high amount of
   biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and heavy metals,
   which can cause severe pollution to the environment. Consequently, the
   palm oil industry is facing remarkable challenges to obey environmental
   regulations. POME has its own potential for sustainable reuse through
   biotechnological advancement. Microalgae cultivation limitation and
   expensive growth medium are the main drawback for the algal industry;
   therefore, the incorporation of wastewater treatment has provided a
   possible solution to reduce dependency on commercial medium while it
   remediates the wastewater. The integrated POME treatment by culturing
   microalgae could potentially reduce the retention time for wastewater
   treatment and eliminate toxic elements, which are utilized as a nutrient
   by the microalgae. Furthermore, harvesting of microalgal cells from
   treated effluent is also the main challenge. This review article
   discusses the potential, benefits, strategies, and challenges of
   microalgae to be used for integrated effluent treatment, mainly (POME)
   due to its hazardous properties. Immobilization of microalgae for
   continuous, efficient POME treatment and harvesting of immobilized
   microalgae through simple filtration method have also been discussed.

AB This review article focuses on recent updates on remediation of
   industrial wastewater (IWW) through microalgae cultivation. These
   include how adding additional supplements of nutrient to some specific
   IWWs lacking adequate nutrients improving the microalgae growth and
   remediation simultaneously. Various pretreatments strategy recently
   employed for IWWs treatment other than dealing with microalgae was
   discussed. Various nutrient-rich IWW could be utilized directly with
   additional dilution, supplement of nutrients and without any
   pretreatment. Recent advances in various approaches and new tools used
   for cultivation of microalgae on IWW such as two-step cultivation,
   pre-acclimatization, novel microalgal-bioelectrical systems, integrated
   catalytic intense pulse-light process, sequencing batch reactor, use of
   old stabilized algal-bacterial consortium, immobilized microalgae cells,
   microalgal bacterial membrane photobioreactor, low-intensity magnetic
   field, BIO_ALGAE simulation tool, etc. are discussed. In addition,
   biorefinery of microalgal biomass grown on IWW and its end-use

AB Although a promising technology, using microalgae as feedstock for
   biofuel production faces a broad range of grand challenges to become
   technologically and economically viable. Growing algae for fuel
   production involves altering the culture conditions and processes toward
   maximum accumulation of biomass, especially lipid. Commercial success of
   such targeted use requires optimal combination of processes and culture
   environments so that maximum value from algae biomass will be achieved
   with high productivity, minimal inputs, sustainable resources and lowest
   possible costs. A systematic approach and process integration are
   critical factors in a successful future for algal biorefineries. This
   article presents opinions and supporting literature on: employing
   physiological characteristics of algae for increasing biomass
   productivity and lipid accumulation, opportunities for producing
   co-products, water resource conservation, nutrient recycling, CO2
   capture and delivery and process integration with downstream processing.
   While various information gaps still need to be filled, the available
   knowledge base clearly demonstrates the need for system integration.

AB Rise in human population and gradual decline in fossil fuels are
   increasing the demand for fuels and causing an upsurge in fuel prices
   and global warming. Concomitantly, consumers have raised their health
   awareness by taking various supplements, e.g. omega-3 fatty acids, thus
   calling for advanced nutraceuticals. Both issues are addressed by recent
   research on microalgae, which can be easily cultivated to produce
   lipidic biofuels and active drugs. Here, we reviewed the types and
   biosynthesis of microalgal lipids. We discuss genetic engineering and
   manipulation of cultivation conditions for enhancing lipid production.
   We present techniques for lipid extraction, with focus on green
   techniques. We also discuss the technical and economic challenges in
   manufacturing microalgae-based biofuels and other bioproducts at the
   industrial scale. Last, the market potentials and further research
   directions for future commercialization of microalgae lipids are
   discussed.

AB The development of microalgal biofuels is of significant importance in
   advancing the energy transition, alleviating food pressure, preserving
   the natural environment, and addressing climate change. Numerous
   countries and regions across the globe have conducted extensive research
   and strategic planning on microalgal bioenergy, investing significant
   funds and manpower into this field. However, the microalgae biofuel
   industry has faced a downturn due to the constraints of high costs. In
   the past decade, with the development of new strains, technologies, and
   equipment, the feasibility of large-scale production of microalgae
   biofuel should be re-evaluated. Here, we have gathered research results
   from the past decade regarding microalgae biofuel production, providing
   insights into the opportunities and challenges faced by this industry
   from the perspectives of microalgae selection, modification, and
   cultivation. In this review, we suggest that highly adaptable microalgae
   are the preferred choice for large-scale biofuel production, especially
   strains that can utilize high concentrations of inorganic carbon sources
   and possess stress resistance. The use of omics technologies and genetic
   editing has greatly enhanced lipid accumulation in microalgae. However,
   the associated risks have constrained the feasibility of large-scale
   outdoor cultivation. Therefore, the relatively controllable cultivation
   method of photobioreactors (PBRs) has made it the mainstream approach
   for microalgae biofuel production. Moreover, adjusting the performance
   and parameters of PBRs can also enhance lipid accumulation in
   microalgae. In the future, given the relentless escalation in demand for
   sustainable energy sources, microalgae biofuels should be deemed a
   pivotal constituent of national energy planning, particularly in the
   case of China. The advancement of synthetic biology helps reduce the
   risks associated with genetically modified (GM) microalgae and enhances
   the economic viability of their biofuel production.

AB The utilization of organic liquid fertilizer PAL-1 as the culture medium
   of the microalgaChlorella vulgariswas investigated for the purpose of
   biodiesel production. Cell growth and lipid accumulation in PAL-1 were
   evaluated and compared with those in the artificial medium BG-11. Cells
   showed mixotrophic growth when utilizing the organic liquid fertilizer
   PAL-1. The rates of cell growth (0.143 d-1) and N consumption (14.9
   mg/L/d) in PAL-1 were almost the same as those in BG-11, under the
   presence of 2% CO2-enriched aeration and light irradiation. Lipid
   synthesis was triggered in PAL-1 on day 4, when nitrogen was completely
   consumed, and the lipid content reached up to 48% thereafter. Lipid
   productivity could be enhanced using repeated-batch cultivation in which
   cells were exposed to N limitation repeatedly, and thus lipid synthesis
   was induced while maintaining a sufficiently high cell density.

AB This work evaluates the use of native microalgae consortia for a dual
   role: polishing treatment of municipal wastewater effluents and
   microalgae biomass feedstock potential for biodiesel or biofertilizer
   production. An initial screening was undertaken to test N and P removal
   from secondary effluents and biomass production by 12 consortia. A
   subsequent treatment was performed by selected consortia (01 and 12)
   under three operational conditions: stirring (S), S + 12 h of daily
   aeration (S + A) and S + A enriched with CO2 (S + AC). All treatments
   resulted in compliance with environmental regulations (e.g. Directive
   91/271/EEC) and high removal efficiency of nutrients: 64-79% and 80-94%
   of total N and PO43--P respectively. During the experiments it was shown
   that pH alkalinization due to microalgae growth benefits the chemical
   removal of ammonia and phosphorus. Moreover, advantages of pH increase
   could be accomplished by intermittent CO2 addition which in this
   research (treatment S + AC) promoted higher yield and lipid
   concentration. The resulting dry biomass analysis showed a low lipid
   content (0.5-4.3%) not ideal for biodiesel production. Moreover, the
   high rate of ash (29.3-53.0%) suggests that biomass could be readily
   recycled as a biofertilizer due to mineral supply and organic
   constituents formed by C, N and P (e.g. carbohydrate, protein, and
   lipids).

AB The commercial realization of microalgal biodiesel production
   necessitates substantial impulsion towards development of strategies to
   improve lipid yields upstream. Nitrogen stress is the most widely used
   lipid enhancement strategy; yet, it is associated with compromised
   biomass productivity. In this novel approach, combined effect of metals
   and EDTA on lipid productivity of Acutodesmus obliquus was investigated
   under nitrogen limited conditions. The effect of metal concentrations,
   individually and in combination, on microalgal lipids and biomass
   production is a scarcely exploited area. Combined metal stress
   alleviates the constraint of low biomass production under nitrogen
   limitation and improved the overall lipid productivity. Highest lipid
   productivity of 73.23 mg L-1 d-1 was achieved with a combination of iron
   9 mg L-1, magnesium 100 mg L-1 and calcium 27 mg L-1 at limited nitrogen
   (750 mg L-1). This was 1.72 fold higher than nitrogen stress alone and
   1.99 fold higher than BG11 medium. Iron was found to be most
   significantly influencing metal followed by magnesium in response
   surface methodology data analysis. The enhanced photosynthetic
   performance and chlorophyll content further confirmed the significant
   impact of iron and magnesium on the microalgal biomass. The addition of
   EDTA to the optimised metal combination further improved the lipid
   productivity to 80.23 mg L-1 d-1 (2.18 fold). At 3000 L open cultivation
   pond this strategy has resulted in an increase of 2.08 fold in lipid
   productivity. Higher biodiesel conversion rates were also observed with
   this easy, universally applicable and scalable lipid enhancement
   strategy.

AB Produced water (PW) is the most significant waste stream generated in
   the oil and gas industries. The generated PW has the potential to be a
   useful water source rather than waste. While a variety of technologies
   can be used for the treatment of PW for reuse, biological-based
   technologies are an effective and sustainable remediation method.
   Specifically, microalgae, which are a cost-effective and sustainable
   process that use nutrients to eliminate organic pollutants from PW
   during the bioremediation process. In these treatment processes,
   microalgae grow in PW free of charge, eliminate pollutants, and generate
   clean water that can be recycled and reused. This helps to reduce
   CO2levels in the atmosphere while simultaneously producing biofuels,
   other useful chemicals, and added-value products. As such, this review
   focuses on PW generation in the oil and gas industry, PW
   characteristics, and examines the available technologies that can be
   used for PW remediation, with specific attention to algal-based
   technologies. In addition, the various aspects of algae growth and
   cultivation in PW, the effect of growth conditions, water quality
   parameters, and the corresponding treatment performance are presented.
   Lastly, this review emphasizes the bioremediation of PW using algae and
   highlights how to harvest algae that can be processed to generate
   biofuels for added-value products as a sustainable approach.

AB Microalgae have much higher lipid yields than those of agricultural
   oleaginosous crops, and they do not compromise arable land. Despite
   this, current microalga-based processes suffer from several constraints
   pertaining to the biocatalyst and the bioreactor, which hamper
   technologically and economically feasible scale-up. Here, we briefly
   review recent active research and development efforts worldwide, and
   discuss the most relevant shortcomings of microalgal biofuels. This
   review goes one step further relative to related studies, because it
   tackles otherwise scarcely mentioned issues - for example, heterotrophic
   versus autotrophic metabolism, alkane versus glyceride synthesis,
   conduction versus bubbling of CO2, and excretion versus accumulation of
   lipids. Besides promising solutions that have been hypothesized and
   arise from multidisciplinary approaches, we also consider less
   conventional ones. Microalgae and biofuels hold indeed a promising
   partnership, but a fully competitive technology is not expected to be
   available before the end of this decade, because the need for one order
   of magnitude increase in productivity requires development of novel
   apparatuses and transformed cells.

AB Water is the most important resource for mankind existence and
   development. Therefore, maintaining the water to a high quality is
   crucial. Wastewater treatment technologies are constantly evolving.
   Nowadays, the focus has shifted to the use of microalgae cultures, an
   interesting step for wastewater treatments, which can improve the
   treatment process in order to get a clean and healthy water. Microalgae
   by definition are unicellular algal species that can survive
   individually or in chains or clusters. They exist in both suspended
   forms (that free-float in a water body) and attached forms (that adhere
   to a submerged surface) and are one of the most important groups of
   organisms on the planet. Microalgae cultures offer a modern solution of
   wastewater tertiary treatment together with the production of
   potentially valuable biomass, which can be used for several purposes
   (biogas and biofuel production, composting, as animal feed or in
   aquaculture and production of fine chemicals). The microalgae use the
   nutrients (inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus) for their growth and have
   the capacity to remove heavy metals and some toxic organic compounds
   (dyes and antibiotics) and to reduce, also, the chemical and biochemical
   oxygen demand. In the present review we will focus on the application of
   microalgae in the wastewater treatment.

U2 166
AB Microalgae are one of the promising sources for renewable energy
   production, and the light intensity variation can affect the biofuel
   generation and carbon assimilation of mixotrophic microalgae. To reveal
   the response of carbon assimilation to light intensity, the effect of
   light intensity on the carbon source metabolism ofChlorella
   vulgarisunder mixotrophic cultivation was investigated in this study.
   Moreover, the optimal carbon source composition for mixotrophic
   microalgae cultivation was evaluated using bicarbonate (HCO3-) and
   carbonate (CO32-) as inorganic carbon sources, and glucose and acetate
   as organic carbon sources. The optimal light intensity forChlorella
   vulgarisgrowth was at the range of 8000-12000 lux. For the accumulation
   of biochemical components, low light intensity was beneficial to protein
   accumulation, and high light intensity was advantageous for carbohydrate
   and lipid accumulation. With HCO3-and glucose, the maximum lipid content
   reached 37.0% at a light intensity of 12000 lux. The citrate synthase
   activity was negatively correlated with light intensity, showing an
   opposite trend to biomass production. High light intensity had a
   positive impact on Rubisco expression, which promoted the microalgae
   growth and carbon fixing. The energy produced by heterotrophic metabolic
   activities increased at low light intensity, and the enhancement of
   biomass production with high light intensity was mainly caused by the
   improved photoreaction efficiency during the mixotrophic cultivation.

AB The richness of high-value bio-compounds derived from microalgae has
   made microalgae a promising and sustainable source of useful product.
   The present work starts with a review on the usage of open pond and
   photobioreactor in culturing various microalgae strains, followed by an
   in-depth evaluation on the common harvesting techniques used to collect
   microalgae from culture medium. The harvesting methods discussed include
   filtration, centrifugation, flocculation, and flotation. Additionally,
   the advanced extraction technologies using ionic liquids as extractive
   solvents applied to extract high-value bio-compounds such as lipids,
   carbohydrates, proteins, and other bioactive compounds from microalgae
   biomass are summarized and discussed. However, more work needs to be
   done to fully utilize the potential of microalgae biomass for the
   application in large-scale production of biofuels, food additives, and
   nutritive supplements.

AB This review examines the available literature on quantifying lipids in
   microalgae suitable for biofuels research. It discusses their advantages
   and disadvantages, their prevalence in the literature, and draws
   conclusions about the best way to approach choosing a suitable lipid
   measurement technique for microalgal biofuels research. We conclude that
   the method must be chosen based on the following key criteria: (1) the
   level of detail required in the results, and (2) the amount of biomass
   that can be spared for the assay. This review establishes that no method
   can be used as a "golden standard" for all microalgae. However, we
   present a systematic decision chart to choose the best measurement
   method or combination of methods to provide a guide to those wishing to
   understand the differences between the myriad of lipid measurement
   techniques.

AB Microalgal biofuels are one of the best alternatives to replace the
   nonrenewable fossil fuels. Microalgae offer various advantages, the most
   beneficial being their high growth rate and ability to grow on waste
   waters. Many microalgal species have been assessed and studied for
   biofuel production, and have shown varying amounts of lipid contents.
   Harvesting the microalgae and extracting the stored lipids is a major
   hurdle for biofuel production technology, due to their tough cell walls.
   This review focuses on techniques for harvesting, cell disruption and
   lipid extraction of microalgae used for biofuel production.

AB Blue carbon sequestration is a nature-based solution to environmental
   problems caused by climate change and has a significant positive impact
   on the planet and human well-being. This paper bibliometrically and
   systematically analyzed 2,613 studies found in the Web of Science Core
   Collection (WoSCC) from 2003 to 2021 to explore the hotspots and trends
   of blue carbon research using the Bibliometrix package in R studio and
   VOSviewer software. The results based on network co-occurrence analysis
   indicated that mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes were the major
   blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), and mangrove carbon sinks were the most
   popular central research area. Furthermore, phytoplankton and microalgae
   have essential roles in the marine carbon cycle and bioenergy
   utilization, as revealed by the high proportion of published literature,
   while the carbon transport mechanisms of seagrass and macroalgae was
   understudied. Thematic evolution analysis revealed that remote sensing
   was the most commonly used technology as an emerging research field for
   ecological monitoring and ecological investigation in blue carbon
   research in recent years. In addition, increasing carbon sinks by
   artificial approaches, fishery carbon sinks, and carbon sequestration by
   macroalgae have been potential hotspots for blue carbon research
   development. The findings from this study shed light on the trends of
   blue carbon in the past eighteen years, current research points in the
   field, and areas that need more research investment going forward.

AB Wastewater-algal biomass is a promising option to biofuel production.
   However, microbial contaminants constitute a substantial barrier to
   algal biofuel yield. A series of algal strains, Nannochloris oculata and
   Chlorella vulgaris samples (n=30), were purchased from the University of
   Texas, and were used for both stock flask cultures and flat-panel
   vertical bioreactors. A number of media were used for isolation and
   differentiation of potential contaminants according to laboratory
   standards (CLSI). Conventional PCR amplification was performed followed
   by 16S rDNA sequencing to identify isolates at the species level.
   Nanotherapeutics involving a nanomicellar combination of natural
   chitosan and zinc oxide (CZNPs) were tested against the microbial lytic
   groups through Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) tests and
   Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM). Results indicated the presence
   of Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus pumilus/safensis, Cellulosimicrobium
   cellulans, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains at
   a substantial level in the wastewater-fed algal reactors. TEM confirmed
   the effectiveness of CZNPs on the lytic group while the average MICs
   (mg/mL) detected for the strains, Pseudomonas spp., Micrococcus luteus,
   and Bacillus pumilus were 0.417, 3.33, and 1.458, respectively.
   Conclusively, CZNP antimicrobials proved to be effective as inhibitory
   agents against currently identified lytic microbial group, did not
   impact algae cells, and shows promise for in situ interventions.

AB Reliance on plastic has resulted in the widespread occurrence of
   micro-/nanoplastics (MNPs) in aquatic ecosystems, threatening the food
   web and whole ecosystem functions. There is a tight interaction between
   MNPs and microalgae, as dominant living organisms and fundamental
   constituents at the base of the aquatic food web. Therefore, it is
   crucial to better understand the mechanisms underlying the interactions
   between plastic particles and microalgae, as well as the role of
   microalgae in removing MNPs from aquatic ecosystems. In addition,
   finding a suitable route for further utilization of MNP-contaminated
   algal biomass is of great importance. The present review article
   provides an interdisciplinary approach to elucidate microalgae-MNP
   interactions and subsequent impacts on microalgal physiology. The
   degradation of plastic in the environment and differences between micro-
   and nanoplastics are discussed. The possible toxic effects of MNPs on
   microalgal growth, photosynthetic activity, and morphology, due to
   physical or chemical interactions, are evaluated. In addition, the
   potential role of MNPs in microalgae cultivation and/or harvesting,
   together with further safe routes for biomass utilization in biofuel
   production, are suggested. Overall, the current article represents a
   state-of-the-art overview of MNP generation and the consequences of
   their accumulation in the environment, providing new insights into
   microalgae integrated routes of plastic removal and bioenergy
   production.

AB Microalgae have characteristics that make them unique and full of
   potential. Their capacity to generate interesting bioactive molecules
   can add value to various industrial applications. However, most of these
   valuable compounds are intracellular, which makes their extraction a
   major bottleneck. Conventional extraction methodologies have some
   drawbacks, such as low eco-friendly character, high costs and energy
   demand, long treatment times, low selectivity and reduced extraction
   yields, as well as degradation of extracted compounds. The gaps found
   for these methods demonstrate that emergent approaches, such as ohmic
   heating, pulsed electric fields, ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents,
   or high-pressure processing, show potential to overcome the current
   drawbacks in the release and extraction of added-value compounds from
   microalgae. These new processing techniques can potentially extract a
   variety of compounds, making the process more profitable and applicable
   to large scales. This review provides an overview of the most important
   and promising factors to consider in the extraction methodologies
   applied to microalgae. Additionally, it delivers broad knowledge of the
   present impact of these methods on biomass and its compounds, raising
   the possibility of applying them in an integrated manner within a
   biorefinery concept.

AB Triacylglycerols (TAGs) from microalgae have the potential to be used
   for biodiesel, but several technical and economic hurdles have to be
   overcome. A major challenge is efficient extraction of intracellular
   TAGs from algae. Here we investigate the use of enzymes to deconstruct
   algal cell walls/membranes. We describe a rapid and simple assay that
   can assess the efficacy of different enzyme treatments on TAG-containing
   algae. By this means crude papain and bromelain were found to be
   effective in releasing TAGs from the diatomPhaeodactylum tricornutum,
   most likely because of their cysteine protease activity. Pre-treating
   algal biomass with crude papain enabled complete extraction of TAGs
   using heptane/isopropyl alcohol. Heptane as a single solvent was also
   effective, although complete recovery of TAG was not obtained. Economic
   implications of these findings are discussed, with the aim to reduce the
   complexity of, and energy needed in, TAG extraction.

AB In recent decades, the world has been confronted with an energy crisis
   associated with irreversible depletion of traditional sources of fossil
   fuels, coupled with atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases that
   cause global warming. The urgent need to replace traditional fuels led
   to emergence of biodiesel and biohydrogen as interesting alternatives,
   both of which can be obtained via microalga-mediated routes. Microalgae
   are ubiquitous eukaryotic microorganisms, characterized by a remarkable
   metabolic plasticity. Their oil productivities are much higher than
   those of higher terrestrial plants, and they do not require high quality
   agricultural land. Microalgae may indeed be cultivated in brackish and
   wastewaters that provide suitable nutrients (e.g. NH4+, NO3-, and
   PO43-), at the expense of only sunlight and atmospheric CO2. On the
   other hand, metabolic engineering permits release of molecular hydrogen
   also via photosynthetic routes, which will easily be converted to
   electricity in fuel cells or mechanical power in explosion engines, with
   only water vapor as exhaust product in both cases. However, large-scale
   implementation of microalga-based systems to manufacture biodiesel and
   biohydrogen has been economically constrained by their still poor
   volumetric efficiencies, which imply excessively high costs when
   compared with current petrofuel prices. Technological improvements are
   accordingly critical, both on the biocatalyst and the bioreactor levels.
   The current bottlenecks that have apparently precluded full industrial
   exploitation of microalgae cells are critically discussed here, viz.
   those derived from the scarce knowledge on the mechanisms that control
   regulation of gene expression, the reduced number of species subjected
   to successful genetic transformation, the relatively low cell density
   attainable, the poor efficiency in harvesting, and the difficulties in
   light capture and use. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of the
   feasibility of microalgae for production of biofuels via synthesis of
   liquid endocellular metabolites (i.e. triglycerides) and gaseous
   extracellular ones (i.e. molecular hydrogen), and addresses technical
   and economic shortcomings and opportunities along the whole processing
   chain, at both microorganism and reactor levels.

AB Light quality is important for microalgal biomass and bio-component
   accumulation. In this study, 8 kinds of combined monochromatic red (R)
   and blue light (B) were employed to growPhaeodactylum tricornutumusing
   white light (W) as a control. The results indicated thatP.
   tricornutumhad the highest specific growth rate under white light,
   reaching 0.151 (day-1), and the highest biomass (dry weight), reaching
   302.77 mg L-1. The red light and 2R5B were the best forP.
   tricornutumproducing carotenoids and protein, respectively. Carbohydrate
   was not significantly affected by light quality. The lipid content and
   lipid production under 5R2B were the highest, reaching 27.85% (per dry
   weight) and 75.56 mg/L (per culture), respectively. The best production
   of palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1 (n7)), and
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 (n3)) was observed at 4R3B, red light,
   and 1R6B respectively. The highest proportions per total fatty acids of
   C16:0, C16:1 (n7), and EPA were determined as 26.57%, 60.59%, and
   13.87%, which were 15.71%, 11.37%, and 29.49% higher than those under
   white light, respectively. Compared with white light, cells that were
   grown under blue light, red light, and 1R6B revealed the improved lipid
   nutrition quality, reduced AI and TI values, increased HI (h/H) values,
   and increased n3:n6 ratios (under 1R6B only). Combined monochromatic
   light (except 1R6B) produced biodiesel with higher CN values, lower DU
   and IV values, and higher oxidation stability, but slightly reduced
   fluidity at low temperatures. The manipulated spectrum or light quality
   is a promising strategy to regulate the product property ofP.
   tricornutumcultures.

AB Renewable energy sources e.g. biofuels, are the focus of this century.
   Economically and environmental friendly production of such energies are
   the challenges that limit their usages. Microalgae is one of the most
   promising renewable feedstocks. However, economical production of
   microalgae lipid in large scales is conditioned by increasing the lipid
   content of potential strains without losing their growth rate or by
   enhancing both simultaneously. Major effort and advances in this area
   can be made through the environmental stresses. However, such stresses
   not only affect the lipid content and species growth (biomass
   productivity) but also lipid composition. This study provides a
   comprehensive review on lipid enhancement strategies through
   environmental stresses and the synergistic or antagonistic effects of
   those parameters on biomass productivity and the lipid composition. This
   study contains two main parts. In the first part, the cellular
   structure, taxonomic groups, lipid accumulation and lipid compositions
   of the most potential species for lipid production are investigated. In
   the second part, the effects of nitrogen deprivation, phosphorus
   deprivation, salinity stress, carbon source, metal ions, pH, temperature
   as the most important and applicable environmental parameters on lipid
   content, biomass productivity/growth rate and lipid composition are
   investigated.

AB Rapid population growth globally and urbanization have caused a
   significant drop in fossil fuel feedstocks, pushing countries to seek
   alternative sources. Microalgae are a feasible biofuel feedstock due to
   their high photosynthetic efficiency, which gives various potential
   benefits for the environmentally friendly biofuel production process,
   besides the high biomass productivity strains required for a long-term
   integrated platform. Consequently, modifying lipid metabolic pathways to
   increase lipid production in microalgae cells consider a viable
   strategy. Overexpression and transformation of key genes involved in
   lipid biosynthesis are regarded to be crucial methods for increasing
   lipid production. Whereas transformation and gene editing are two
   approaches affecting these alterations, that have been sufficiently
   established in microalgae, transforming these strains into a very
   adaptive stage for successfully designing ways to produce biofuel. The
   current mini-review focuses on potential strategies for improving
   microalgae metabolic engineering, specifically lipogenesis, by regulated
   overexpression of native genes or transgenes such as acetyl coenzyme-A
   carboxylase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and malic enzyme genes, as
   well as current limitations and gaps and future directions.

AB Microalgae are promising sustainable and renewable sources of oils that
   can be used for biodiesel production. In addition, they contain
   important compounds, such as proteins and pigments, which have large
   applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Combining the
   production of these valuable products with wastewater treatment renders
   the cultivation of microalgae very attractive and economically feasible.
   This review paper presents and discusses the current applications of
   microalgae cultivation for wastewater treatment, particularly for the
   removal of phenolic compounds. The effects of cultivation conditions on
   the rate of contaminants removal and biomass productivity, as well as
   the chemical composition of microalgae cells are also discussed.

AB Microalgal biomass has received much attention as a renewable energy
   source and a possible replacement for petroleum-based fuels. Currently,
   mechanical, thermal, and chemical cell disruption methods are limited in
   terms of economics, sustainability, and environmental friendliness.
   Because of this, biological methods are preferred. The structure and
   composition of cell walls in commonly used commercial microalgae, as
   well as the production of lipid and carbohydrate biomolecules for
   microalgal biofuel, are discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the
   advantages and disadvantages of various mechanical and non-mechanical
   cell disruption methods for recovering biomolecules from microalgae are
   compared. The current biological methods of cell disruption are
   investigated, such as gene manipulation and autolysis. The relationship
   between autolysis and programmed cell death and factors influencing the
   process are also discussed. This review will help researchers select the
   proper method for recovering biomolecules from microalgae. The findings
   should expand the use of autolytic biological approaches for economic
   cell disruption in biofuel commercialisation.

AB Microalgal biofuel production is a useful process to produce sustainable
   and carbon-neutral biofuels. The choice of microalgal species and the
   processes adopted in various production stages determine biofuel
   production. In this review, recent technological advancements made in
   various stages of microalgal biofuel production are discussed. This
   review also discussed the recent progress made in harvesting microalgal
   biomass and lipid extraction. In addition, the viability of using
   wastewater as a nutrient source for microalgae and its nutrient removal
   capabilities has been discussed in detail. This is the first study that
   enlists and compares the minimum achievable cost of biofuel produced in
   different studies. Also, process optimization strategies adopted to
   minimize the cost are discussed. The reported biofuel production cost
   varied from 0.14 $/L to 24.33 $/L based on the variation in the
   microalgae strains, production method, and optimization strategies.

AB A new biomass productivity model was parameterized forChlorella
   vulgarisusing short-term (<30 min) oxygen productivities from algal
   microcosms exposed to 6 light intensities (20-420 W/m2) and 6
   temperatures (5-42°C). The model was then validated against experimental
   biomass productivities recorded in bench-scale photobioreactors operated
   under 4 light intensities (30.6-74.3 W/m2) and 4 temperatures (10-30°C),
   yielding an accuracy of 15% over 163 days of cultivation. This modeling
   approach addresses major challenges associated with the accurate
   prediction of algal productivity at full-scale. Firstly, while most
   prior modeling approaches have only considered the impact of light
   intensity on algal productivity, the model herein validated also
   accounts for the critical impact of temperature. Secondly, this study
   validates a theoretical approach to convert short-term oxygen
   productivities into long-term biomass productivities. Thirdly, the
   experimental methodology used has the practical advantage of only
   requiring one day of experimental work for complete model
   parameterization. The validation of this new modeling approach is
   therefore an important step for refining feasibility assessments of
   algae biotechnologies.

AB In the food industry, manufacturers and customers have paid more
   attention to natural pigments instead of the synthetic counterparts for
   their excellent coloring ability and healthy properties. Microalgae are
   proven as one of the major photosynthesizers of naturally derived
   commercial pigments, gaining higher value in the global food pigment
   market. Microalgae-derived pigments, especially chlorophylls,
   carotenoids and phycobiliproteins, have unique colors and molecular
   structures, respectively, and show different physiological activities
   and health effects in the human body. This review provides recent
   updates on characteristics, application fields, stability in production
   and extraction processes of chlorophylls, carotenoids and
   phycobiliproteins to standardize and analyze their commercial production
   from microalgae. Potential food commodities for the pigment as
   eco-friendly colorants, nutraceuticals, and antioxidants are summarized
   for the target products. Then, recent cultivation strategies, metabolic
   and genomic designs are presented for high pigment productivity.
   Technical bottlenecks of downstream processing are discussed for
   improved stability and bioaccessibility during production. The
   production strategies of microalgal pigments have been exploited to
   varying degrees, with some already being applied at scale while others
   remain at the laboratory level. Finally, some factors affecting their
   global market value and future prospects are proposed. The
   microalgae-derived pigments have great potential in the food industry
   due to their high nutritional value and competitive production cost.

AB The continuing use of fossil fuels accelerated the energy crisis,
   environmental pollution, and global warming in recent years. These
   problems are the driving force of the worldwide search for new
   alternative energy, among which biomass is considered to be one of the
   most promising candidates due to its renewable, carbon neutral and high
   productivity characteristics. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an
   alternative technology of exploiting different types of biomass for
   fuels production, involving the direct biomass conversion to liquid, in
   the presence of a solvent and in some times catalyst. HTL has undergone
   a sudden increase in the number of publications in recent years. The
   wide variation in different types of feedstock tested, their initial
   state, the reaction conditions and/or the catalysts applied renders a
   wide but rather fragmentary spectrum of knowledge generated. This review
   is a summary of state-of-the-art knowledge of HTL for various feedstocks
   such as woody biomass, wastes, plastics and microalgae.

AB Pyrolysis is a promising route for biofuels production from microalgae
   at moderate temperatures (400-600°C) in an inert atmosphere. Depending
   on the operating conditions, pyrolysis can produce biochar and/or
   bio-oil. In practice, knowledge for thermal decomposition
   characteristics and kinetics of microalgae during pyrolysis is essential
   for pyrolyzer design and pyrolysis optimization. Recently, the pyrolysis
   kinetics of microalgae has become a crucial topic and received
   increasing interest from researchers. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   has been employed as a proven technique for studying microalgae
   pyrolysis in a kinetic control regime. In addition, a number of kinetic
   models have been applied to process the TGA data for kinetic evaluation
   and parameters estimation. This paper aims to provide a state-of-the art
   review on recent research activities in pyrolysis characteristics and
   kinetics of various microalgae. Common kinetic models predicting the
   thermal degradation of microalgae are examined and their pros and cons
   are illustrated.

AB The work seeks to raise awareness of a fundamental problem that impacts
   the renewable generation of fuels and chemicals via (photo)synthetic
   biology. At issue is regulation of the endogenous cellular carbon
   partitioning between different biosynthetic pathways, over which the
   living cell exerts stringent control. The regulation of carbon
   partitioning in photosynthesis is not understood. In plants, microalgae
   and cyanobacteria, methods need be devised to alter photosynthetic
   carbon partitioning between the sugar, terpenoid, and fatty acid
   biosynthetic pathways, to lower the prevalence of sugar biosynthesis and
   correspondingly upregulate terpenoid and fatty acid hydrocarbons
   production in the cell. Insight from unusual but naturally occurring
   carbon-partitioning processes can help in the design of blueprints for
   improved photosynthetic fuels and chemicals production.

U1 2
U2 16
AB Photosynthesis is the most important bioenergy conversion process on
   Earth. Capturing instantaneous changes in in situ photosynthesis in open
   ocean ecosystems remains a major challenge. In this study, fast
   repetition rate fluorometry (FRRF), which can obtain nondestructive,
   real-time and in situ estimates of photosynthetic parameters, was used
   for the first time to continuously observe the spatial variation in in
   situ photosynthetic parameters in the eastern Indian Ocean (EIO). We
   further formulated new insights regarding abiotic and biotic factors of
   potential importance in determining photosynthetic performance. First,
   we found that the distributions of micro/nano- and picophytoplankton
   were opposite under the control of nutrient concentrations.
   Micro/nanophytoplankton had higher cell abundances in the nearshore and
   upwelling regions, while picophytoplankton had higher abundances in the
   open ocean, and Prochlorococcus was the dominant group. Second, based on
   the FRRF technology, we obtained the high-precision and high-density
   vertical profile map of photosynthetic parameters in the euphotic layer.
   It was observed that values of the maximum photochemical efficiency
   (Fv/Fm; 0.14-0.55, unitless) and the functional absorption cross-section
   of PSII (sigmaPSII; 1.71-4.90 nm2 RCII-1) increased with increasing
   depth, while high values of the photosynthetic electron transfer rates
   (ETRRCII; 0.0019-17.0292 mol e- mol RCII-1 s-1) and the nonphotochemical
   quenching (NPQNSV; 0.35-7.26, unitless) occurred in the shallow 50 m
   layer, and the values decreased as the depth increased. Finally, we
   discussed limiting factors that regulated the distribution of
   photosynthetic parameters and concluded that optical properties varied
   significantly with changes in the ocean physico-chemical parameters and
   taxonomic composition of phytoplankton assemblages in the EIO.
   Picophytoplankton (especially cyanobacteria), rather than the
   micro/nanophytoplankton community, was the dominant factor influencing
   photosynthesis. Among abiotic factors, photosynthetically active
   radiation (PAR) was the proximal limiting factor affecting
   photosynthetic efficiency, followed by temperature and dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Consequently, phytoplankton photosynthetic
   parameters exhibited great variability, allowing rapid responses to
   environmental condition changes. In this study, we established the basis
   for detecting future changes in primary production in this oligotrophic
   area.

AB Microalgae and bacteria, known for their resilience, rapid growth, and
   proximate ecological partnerships, play fundamental roles in
   environmental and biotechnological advancements. This comprehensive
   review explores the synergistic interactions between microalgae and
   bacteria as an innovative approach to address some of the most pressing
   environmental issues and the demands of clean and renewable freshwater
   and energy sources. Studies indicated that microalgae-bacteria consortia
   can considerably enhance the output of biotechnological applications;
   for instance, various reports showed during wastewater treatment the COD
   removal efficiency increased by 40%-90.5% due to microalgae-bacteria
   consortia, suggesting its great potential amenability in biotechnology.
   This review critically synthesizes research works on the microalgae and
   bacteria nexus applied in the advancements of renewable energy
   generation, with a special focus on biohydrogen, reclamation of
   wastewater and desalination processes. The mechanisms of underlying
   interactions, the environmental factors influencing consortia
   performance, and the challenges and benefits of employing these
   bio-complexes over traditional methods are also discussed in detail.
   This paper also evaluates the biotechnological applications of these
   microorganism consortia for the augmentation of biomass production and
   the synthesis of valuable biochemicals. Furthermore, the review sheds
   light on the integration of microalgae-bacteria systems in microbial
   fuel cells for concurrent energy production, waste treatment, and
   resource recovery. This review postulates microalgae-bacteria consortia
   as a sustainable and efficient solution for clean water and energy,
   providing insights into future research directions and the potential for
   industrial-scale applications.

AB Considerable research activities are underway involving microalgae
   species in order to treat industrial wastewater to address the
   waste-to-bioenergy economy. Several studies of wastewater treatment
   using microalgae have been primarily focused on removal of key nutrients
   such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Although the use of wastewater would
   provide nutrients and water for microalgae growth, the whole process is
   even more complex than the conventional microalgae cultivation on
   freshwater media. The former one adds several gridlocks to the system.
   These gridlocks are surplus organic and inorganic nutrients
   concentration, pH of wastewater, wastewater color, total dissolved
   solids (TDS), microbial contaminants, the scale of photobioreactor,
   batch versus continuous system, harvesting of microalgae biomass etc.
   The present review discusses, analyses, and summarizes key aspects
   involved in the treatment of wastewaters from distillery, food/snacks
   product processing, and dairy processing industry using microalgae along
   with sustainable production of its biomass. This review further
   evaluates the bottlenecks for individual steps involved in the process
   such as pretreatment of wastewater for contaminants removal,
   concentration tolerance/dilutions, harvesting of microalgae biomass, and
   outdoor scale-up. The review also describes various strategies to
   optimize algal biomass and lipid productivities for various wastewater
   and photobioreactor type. Moreover, the review emphasizes the potential
   of co-cultivation of microorganism such as yeast and bacteria along with
   microalgae in the treatment of industrial wastewater.

AB Microalgae have been exploited for biofuel generation in the current era
   due to its enormous energy content, fast cellular growth rate,
   inexpensive culture approaches, accumulation of inorganic compounds, and
   CO2sequestration. Currently, research is ongoing towards the advancement
   of the microalgae cultivation parameters to enhance the biomass yield.
   The main objective of this study was to delineate the progress of
   physicochemical parameters for microalgae cultivation such as gaseous
   transfer, mixing, light demand, temperature, pH, nutrients and the
   culture period. This review demonstrates the latest research trends on
   mass transfer coefficient of different microalgae culturing reactors,
   gas velocity optimization, light intensity, retention time, and radiance
   effects on microalgae cellular growth, temperature impact on chlorophyll
   production, and nutrient dosage ratios for cellulosic metabolism to
   avoid nutrient deprivation. Besides that, cultivation approaches for
   microalgae associated with mathematical modeling for different
   parameters, mechanisms of microalgal growth rate and doubling time have
   been elaborately described. Along with that, this review also documents
   potential lipid-carbohydrate-protein enriched microalgae candidates for
   biofuel, biomass productivity, and different cultivation conditions
   including open-pond cultivation, closed-loop cultivation, and
   photobioreactors. Various photobioreactor types, the microalgae strain,
   productivity, advantages, and limitations were tabulated. In line with
   microalgae cultivation, this study also outlines in detail numerous
   biofuels from microalgae.

AB Microalgae contain valuable compounds that can be harnessed for
   industrial applications. Lignocellulose biomass is a plant material
   containing in abundance organic substances such as carbohydrates,
   phenolics, organic acids and other secondary compounds. As growth of
   microalgae on organic substances was confirmed during heterotrophic and
   mixotrophic cultivation, lignocellulose derived compounds can become a
   feedstock to cultivate microalgae and produce target compounds. In this
   review, different treatment methods to hydrolyse lignocellulose into
   organic substrates are presented first. Secondly, the effect of
   lignocellulosic hydrolysates, organic substances typically present in
   lignocellulosic hydrolysates, as well as minor co-products, on growth
   and accumulation of target compounds in microalgae cultures is
   described. Finally, the possibilities of using lignocellulose
   hydrolysates as a common feedstock for microalgae cultures are
   evaluated.

AB This thesis focuses on maximizing the areal productivity for different
   reactor concepts by applying different operational strategies. In
   chapter 2, construction of the AlgaePARC (Algae Production And Research
   Centre) pilot facility was described. This facility was constructed to
   bridge the gap between fundamental research and commercial scale
   production. The pilot facility allows the comparison and improvement of
   pilot scale photobioreactors and operational strategies under identical
   outdoor conditions. Operational strategies influence the performance of
   photobioreactors, therefore the performance of four outdoor
   photobioreactors cultivated operated at different dilution rates in
   Chapter 3 are compared. In this chapter, the productivity and
   photosynthetic efficiency ofNannochloropsissp. CCAP 211/78 were
   compared. The optimal dilution rate was determined for each
   photobioreactor by operation of the different photobioreactors at
   different dilution rates. Vertical photobioreactors resulted in higher
   areal productivities and photosynthetic efficiencies, 19-24 g m-2/day
   and 2.4-4.2%. Lower areal productivity and photosynthetic efficiency
   were found for the horizontal systems; 12-15 g m-2/day and 1.5-1.8%. In
   chapter 4, the effect of biomass concentration on the performance
   ofNannochloropsissp. CCAP211/78 was studied in three outdoor pilot-scale
   photobioreactors. The following reactor designs were considered in this
   chapter: open raceway pond (OPR), horizontal tubular (HT)
   photobioreactor and a vertically stacked horizontal tubular (VT)
   photobioreactor. All reactors were operated continuously as turbidostat
   at different biomass concentrations. Highest areal productivities were
   obtained on days with a high light intensity for all systems, while days
   with a low light intensity resulted in the highest photosynthetic
   efficiencies. Overall highest areal productivities were obtained for OPR
   and VT, most likely due to more efficient ground areal light
   interception. The observation that night biomass loss was coupled to net
   growth was reported. At lower biomass concentrations and concomitant
   higher growth rates the specific night biomass losses were higher.
   Microalgal specific light absorption coefficient was correlated to
   biomass concentration; higher biomass concentrations resulted in higher
   specific absorption coefficients, resulting in a steeper light gradient.
   In chapter 5, model parameters that allow the prediction of microalgal
   growth with mathematical models were determined for two oleaginous
   strains;Neochloris oleoabundansandNannochloropsissp. With the determined
   model parameters algal growth can be predicted under process conditions
   that can be expected during large scale production, on the productivity
   of microalgae cultivation systems. Simulations showed that a less tight
   temperature control (20-35 °C) resulted in a 20-30% reduction in
   productivity compared to a more tight temperature control (24-28 °C).
   The specific growth rate and specific absorption coefficient showed to
   have a big impact on the prediction and it is hypothesized that the
   maximal specific growth rate ofNannochloropsissp. differs considerably
   among strains. In Chapter 6, the feasibility the commercial production
   of microalgae is analysed via a techno-economic evaluation of for a 100
   hectares facility for six locations. The projections made in this
   chapter result in a current biomass production cost of 3.4 Euro/kg for
   microalgae cultivation in Spain, with an expected reduction to 0.5
   Euro/kg in ten years. A sensitivity analysis reveals the roadmap to
   achieve this. In Chapter 7, the status of microalgae production
   technologies considering the insights obtained in this thesis is
   discussed.

AB Several microalgal species are capable of growing heterotrophically,
   exhibiting considerable metabolic versatility and flexibility. As
   demonstrated in this review, heterotrophic conditions can enhance the
   biomass concentration by as much as 25-fold compared with phototrophic
   conditions. Currently, these types of cultivation are economically
   feasible only for high-value products, including polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (PUFAs), pigments, antioxidants, polysaccharides, food and
   aquaculture feed from carbon sources, such as glucose, acetate or
   glycerol. To make heterotrophic cultivation economically viable for
   high-volume, low-value commodities, such as biofuels, the use of
   unconventional carbon sources, such as food and agricultural wastes and
   wastewater, is recommended. Since microalgae are capable of modifying
   their metabolism according to varying culture conditions, it is possible
   to modify, control and therefore maximize the production of target
   compounds. This manuscript not only offers a review of the most relevant
   and recent findings in the use of heterotrophic microalgal cultivation
   for enhanced metabolite production but also provides recommendations for
   future research on this promising subject.

AB The shortage of fossil fuels is actually a major economic issue in the
   context of increasing energy demand. Renewable energies are thus gaining
   in importance. For instance, microalgae-based fuels are viewed as an
   alternative. Microalgae are microscopic unicellular plants, which
   typically grow in marine and freshwater environments. They are fast
   growing, have high photosynthetic efficiency, and have relatively small
   land requirement and water consumption in comparison with conventional
   land crops biofuels. Nonetheless, selling biofuels is still limited by
   high cost. Here, we review biofuel production from microalgae, including
   cultivation, harvesting, drying, extraction and conversion of microalgal
   lipids. Cost issues may be solved by upstream and downstream measures:
   (1) upstream measures, in which highly productive strains are obtained
   by strain selection, genetic engineering and metabolic engineering, and
   (2) downstream measures, in which high biofuels yields are obtained by
   enhancing the cellular lipid content and by advanced conversion of
   microalgal biomass to biofuels. Maximum biomass and high biofuels
   production can be achieved by two-stage culture strategies, which is a
   win-win approach because it solves the conflicts between cell growth and
   biomass accumulation.

AB Microalgae are microscopic organisms that have a broad range of
   applications, from wastewater treatment, CO2 mitigation to therapeutic
   proteins, and pharmaceuticals. Recently, the combination of wastewater
   treatment-based microalgae and the use of the obtained biomass as
   biofertilizers/stimulants/pesticides have been highly emphasized for
   their use in the agriculture field. Biofertilizers are a need of today's
   agriculture practices due to the increasing demand for food to feed a
   hungry planet while avoiding chemical contamination by the
   over-application of synthetic fertilizers. There is a constant need for
   modern techniques for the use of microalgae in a sustainable manner to
   harness their products to their full extent. Various types of
   bioreactors are available on the market, each with its own advantages

AB Microalgae, as the most promising raw material for biodiesel, can absorb
   and transform N, P, and organic matter in wastewater into cell
   components such as oil, carbohydrate, and protein. The cultivation of
   microalgae in wastewater provides the possibility to realize harmless
   treatment and resource utilization of wastewater and reduce the cost of
   microalgal culture. Whether in a single microalgal culture process or
   wastewater system, there always be a large number of bacteria
   interacting with microalgae, forming a complex microecological system.
   Although microalgal-bacterial coculture system is feasible features for
   the higher biomass production and better nutrient adaptability from
   wastewater, the precise understanding of interaction and coexistence in
   water bodies is still unclear. Some major challenges are to develop
   sustainability in the microalgal-bacterial coculture system due to the
   incomplete knowledge about the mechanism of communication, algal growth
   promotion, and effect of microalgae on the indigenous bacteria in
   wastewater. In the present review, nutritional interaction and signal
   transduction, two main interaction models of algae and bacteria, and the
   effect of synergism of these two models on microalgal system are
   summarized. Moreover, the impact of algal-bacterial coculture on algal
   growth and removal of pollutants in wastewater treatment process was
   expounded systematically to develop highly efficient consortium systems
   by covering the sustainability limitations. This work would provide
   guidance for the establishment of efficient algal-bacterial symbiosis
   system in the wastewater with complex microecology and nutrient
   environment to improve the accumulation of microalgal biomass and reduce
   the cost of microalgal culture.

AB Microalgae have gained enormous consideration from scientific community
   worldwide emerging as a viable feedstock for a renewable energy source
   virtually being carbon neutral, high lipid content, and comparatively
   more advantageous to other sources of biofuels. Although microalgae are
   seen as a valuable source in majority part of the world for production
   of biofuels and bioproducts, still they are unable to accomplish
   sustainable large-scale algal biofuel production. Wastewater has organic
   and inorganic supplements required for algal growth. The coupling of
   microalgae with wastewater is an effective way of waste remediation and
   a cost-effective microalgal biofuel production. In this review article,
   we will primarily discuss the possibilities and current scenario
   regarding coupling of microalgal cultivation with biofuel production
   emphasizing recent progress in this area.

AB Microalgae hold the promise of an inexpensive and sustainable source of
   biofuels. The existing microalgal cultivation technologies need
   significant improvement to outcompete other biofuel sources such as
   terrestrial plants. Application of 'algomics' approaches under different
   abiotic stress conditions could be an effective strategy for
   optimization of microalgal growth and production of high-quality
   biofuels. In this review, we discuss the roles of omics in understanding
   genome structure and biocomponents metabolism in various microalgal
   species to optimize sustainable biofuel production. Application of
   individual and integrated omics revealed that genes and metabolic
   pathways of microalgae have been altered under multiple stress
   conditions, resulting in an increase in biocomponents, providing a
   research platform for expansion of genetic engineering studies in
   microalgal strains.

AB Cultivation of microalgae to utilize CO2and nutrients in the wastewater
   to generate biofuel products is a promising research objective. However,
   the process faces tremendous technical difficulties, especially the
   harvest of microalgae cells, an economically challenging step. Several
   researchers recently reported co-culturing of filamentous fungi with
   microalgae so that microalgae cells can be co-pelletized in order to
   facilitate the cell harvest. This algae pelletization via the
   filamentous fungi represents an innovative approach to address both the
   cost and sustainability issues in algae biofuel production and also has
   potential with direct commercial applications. This paper reviews the
   current research status in this area and some possible drawbacks of this
   method in order to provide some possible directions for the future
   research.

AB Microalgae are rapidly growing, low-input requiring, sun light-utilizing
   microorganisms capable of converting carbon dioxide into various natural
   products, a major portion of which are hydrocarbons. Their cellular
   compartmentalization and photosynthetic apparatus depend on robust
   turnover of two hydrocarbon classes, isoprenoids and acyl-lipids. This
   review summarizes the current understanding of algal hydrocarbon
   metabolism, including carbon partitioning capacities, the localization
   and size of precursor pools, environmental effects on flux distribution,
   and limiting factors towards efficient (heterologous) hydrocarbon
   production. Questions and challenges regarding our knowledge of algal
   hydrocarbon metabolism as well as guidelines for systematic engineering
   are presented. Recent engineering achievements indicate fundamental
   plasticity in the (heterologous) hydrocarbon metabolism of green algae
   while highlighting their potential as renewable sources of these
   products.

AB This special issue contains 11 papers featuring a set of peer-reviewed
   articles explaining some of the cutting-edge technologies, which are
   expected to create short-cuts in the production of more affordable
   biofuels and bioproducts. These technologies are still at some risk and
   certainly not yet mature; however, they have great potential to become
   mature within a decade or so, resulting in their large-scale
   commercialization. Topics covered are: the potential of microalgae for
   lipid biofuel and the major technical and economic challenges which are
   still associated with this very promising technology; the use of
   cutting-edge genetic engineering technologies for the creation of
   designer crops that could be used for cheap production of biofuels; an
   excellent example of relatively high value recombinant co-product, such
   as a heterologous biodegradable plastic, in a major bioenergy crop; the
   simple theory of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions via production of
   low-carbon-dedicated bioenergy crops, and the major challenges that can
   prevent such reduction, and the possible harm that otherwise might
   occur; and the relatively unnecessary regulatory hurdles that are
   presently associated with the production of genetically engineered crop.

AB Microalgae biomass as a sustainable feedstock has become an attractive
   alternative to traditional terrestrial plants for production of
   renewable chemicals and biofuels. However, achieving high productivity
   remains as a major challenge in commercial applications. Mixotrophic
   culture is gaining increasing attention because the metabolic capability
   of some microalgae to use both photosynthesis and organic carbon leads
   to higher productivity than either phototrophic or heterotrophic process
   alone. The potential of mixotrophy for mass algal cultivation should be
   fully explored. In this review, the superior productivity of mixotrophic
   cultivation of different algal species was compared with those of
   phototrophic and heterotrophic culture; The synergism of carbon and
   energy mechanism of mixotrophic growth was discussed; Particularly, the
   uniqueness of metabolic regulation of microalgae under mixotrophic
   culture in terms of carbon recycling and forms of carbon utilized was
   illustrated; The application in wastewater treatment of mixotrophic
   culture for uptaking nutrients and organics was discussed. Additionally,
   the opportunities and challenges of large-scale microalgae production
   were proposed along with summaries of advancement in various mixotrophic
   culture technologies. The current literature collectively supports the
   great potential of mixotrophic culture in enhancing productivities of
   microalgal biomass and bioproducts with synergy of light and organic
   carbons metabolism. The findings provide insights for comprehensive
   understanding the key role of interaction of light and carbons on the
   enhancement of microalgal biomass and bioproducts under mixotrophic
   conditions and suggest mixotrophic algal culture should be one of the
   priority topics for both future research and commercialization efforts.

AB This article explores a new, highly scalable bioreactor design for
   photosynthetic, lipid producing organisms. Microalgae are important to
   the recovery of resources from wastewater and microalgae derived oils
   have the potential to become an important source of transportation
   fuels, but current photobioreactor designs are not readily scalable. In
   contrast, this article evaluates the productivity of periodic designs
   that use repeated unit cells defined by fluid dynamically driven
   recirculation profiles so that scaleup may be achieved simply by
   increasing (massively) the number of unit cells. Photobioreactors with
   one, seven, and nineteen unit cells were constructed containing 13.2,
   92.4, and 251 gal, respectively, to demonstrate scalability. Development
   of a kinetic growth model accounting for variations in photointensity
   versus depth predicts approximately linear (instead of exponential)
   growth as observed in the first week of productivity. This design
   decreases the required power per volume by over 50% compared to
   paddlewheel designs, and material costs per unit cell decrease with
   increasing reactor size, because flow symmetry defines the boundaries of
   the unit cells in the absence of internal material walls. These results
   provide a more efficient path to scale up to commercially relevant
   acreage, bringing algal biofuels closer to energy parity.

AB The economics surrounding five algae-to-fuels process scenarios were
   examined. The different processes modeled were as follows: an open pond
   producing either triacylglycerides (TAG) or free fatty acid methyl ester
   (FAME), a solar-lit photobioreactor producing either FAME or free fatty
   acids (FFA), and a light emitting diode irradiated (LED-lighted)
   photobioreactor producing TAG. These processes were chosen to represent
   both classical and esoteric approaches presented in the open literature.
   Viable (or suggested) processing techniques to liberate and purify (and
   convert) the microalgal triacylglycerides were then modeled to accompany
   each growth option. The investment and cost per kg of fuel or fuel
   precursor for each process was determined. The open pond produced TAG at
   $7.50/kg, while the process using the LED-lit photobioreactor produced
   TAG at $33/kg. The scenario containing the solar-lit photobioreactor
   produced FAME at $25/kg, while the open pond produced FAME at $4/kg. The
   scenario containing the solar-lit photobioreactor produced FFA at
   $29/kg. The open pond scenarios appear to be closest to the $1/kg
   pricepoint at this time, and thus are the most viable economic options.
   Future technological advancements that reduce the cost of bioreactor
   vessels, LED lighting, and solvent recovery, may reduce the oil
   production costs of these scenarios to a more attractive level.

AB Green hydrogen, produced during microalgal photosynthesis, is regarded
   as one of the most promising sustainable energy sources. It utilizes
   sunlight and water, which are essentially unlimited, and its combustion
   results in only water as a waste product. In microalgal hydrogen energy
   production systems, the sensitivity of hydrogenase to O2 poses a
   significant challenge, limiting sustained photosynthetic H2 production
   in microalgae. Additionally, efficient photosynthetic H2 production in
   anaerobic microalgal cells is hindered by impaired electron source
   (photosystem II) and electron loss through the Calvin-Benson cycle,
   cyclic electron transfer around photosystem I, and O2 photoreduction,
   which are identified as the other key challenges. Over the past eight
   decades, considerable progress has been made in addressing these
   challenges and regulating electron transfer to achieve sustainable and
   efficient photosynthetic H2 production in microalgae. In this review, we
   discuss a range of regulatory methods for achieving sustainable and
   efficient photosynthetic H2 production in microalgae. Emphasizing the
   significant progress made over the past eight decades, we also address
   current challenges and propose potential future solutions.

AB Microalgae biofuel is one of the most promising renewable energy sources
   that can contribute to the replacement of fossil fuels globally because
   of its sustainability and its ability to reduce the carbon dioxide
   emission in the atmosphere. However, the rigidity of microalgae of
   microalgae cell wall inhibits the extraction of lipids for biofuel
   production. To improve microalgae biofuel production, different
   pre-treatment techniques have been studied to evaluate their
   effectiveness on microalgae cell wall disruption. The main objective of
   this paper is to review the different pre-treatment technologies used in
   biofuel production from microalgae biomass and to critically discuss the
   current limitations and promising perspectives towards achieving
   economic and industrial scale production. Pre-treatment methods reviewed
   are categorized into mechanical techniques (e.g. high-pressure
   homogenizer and bead mills), physical techniques (e.g. ultrasonic and
   microwave methods), thermal pre-treatment techniques (e.g. autoclave and
   steam explosion), chemical techniques (e.g. catalytic and enzymatic),
   and combined techniques. Furthermore, comparisons of these techniques
   are discussed. The overall effect of the applications and methods on
   biofuel production together with energy consumption are critically
   examined.

AB A growing world population is causing hazardous compounds to form at an
   increasingly rapid rate, calling for ecological action. Wastewater
   management and treatment is an expensive process that requires
   appropriate integration technology to make it more feasible and
   cost-effective. Algae are of great interest as potential feedstocks for
   various applications, including environmental sustainability, biofuel
   production, and the manufacture of high-value bioproducts.
   Bioremediation with microalgae is a potential approach to reduce
   wastewater pollution. The need for effective nutrient recovery,
   greenhouse gas reduction, wastewater treatment, and biomass reuse has
   led to a wide interest in the use of microalgae for wastewater
   treatment. Furthermore, algae biomass can be used to produce bioenergy
   and high-value bioproducts. The use of microalgae as medicine
   (production of bioactive and medicinal compounds), biofuels,
   biofertilizers, and food additives has been explored by researchers
   around the world. Technological and economic barriers currently prevent
   the commercial use of algae, and optimal downstream processes are needed
   to reduce production costs. Therefore, the simultaneous use of
   microalgae for wastewater treatment and biofuel production could be an
   economical approach to address these issues. This article provides an
   overview of algae and their application in bioremediation, bioenergy
   production, and bioactive compound production. It also highlights the
   current problems and opportunities in the algae-based sector, which has
   recently become quite promising.

AB Microalgae metabolites include biologically active compounds with
   therapeutic effects such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory and
   immunomodulation effects. One of the most recent focuses is on utilizing
   microalgae lipid-based biologically active compounds in food
   applications. However, most microalgae biological active compounds in
   their natural forms have common drawbacks like low solubility, low
   physicochemical stability and strong susceptibility to degradation,
   which significantly limits their application in foods, therefore, it is
   important to find solutions to retain their functional properties. In
   the present work, a comprehensive review on multi-product biorefinery
   was carried out from upstream processing stage to downstream processing
   stage, and identify critical processes and factors that impact bioactive
   material acquisition and retention. Furthermore, since nanoencapsulation
   technology emerges as an effective solution for microalgae nutraceutical
   product's retention, this work also focus on the nanoparticle
   perspective and comprehensively reviews the current nanoencapsulation
   solutions of the microalgae bioactive extract products. The aim is to
   depict advances in the formulations of microalage bioactive
   nanoparticles and provide a critical analysis of the reported
   nanoparticle formation. Overall, through the investigation of microalgae
   from biomass to bioactive nanoparticles, we aim to facilitate microalgae
   nutraceuticals incorporation as high value-added ingredients in more
   functional food that can improve human health.

AB The ever-increasing quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can
   be attributed to the rapid increase in the world population as well as
   the expansion of globalization. Hence, achieving carbon neutrality by
   2050 stands as a challenging task to accomplish. Global
   industrialization had necessitated the need to enhance the current
   production systems to reduce greenhouse gases emission, whilst promoting
   the capture of carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Hydrogen is often touted
   as the fuel of future via substituting fossil-based fuels. In this
   regard, renewable hydrogen happens to be a niche sector of novel
   technologies in achieving carbon neutrality. Microalgae-based
   biohydrogen technologies could be a sustainable and economical approach
   to produce hydrogen from a renewable source, while simultaneously
   promoting the absorption of carbon dioxide. This review highlights the
   current perspectives of biohydrogen production as an alternate source of
   energy. In addition, future challenges associated with biohydrogen
   production at large-scale application, storage and transportation are
   included. Key technologies in producing biohydrogen are finally
   described in building a carbon-neutral future.

AB Background: One of the major problems in the production of lipids for
   biotechnological purposes using microalgae is maintaining a high
   productivity of these molecules without reducing cellular biomass. High
   production rates are usually obtained by cultivating microalgae under
   different stress conditions. However, many of these changes usually
   result in lower biomass productivity. Therefore, the optimization of the
   culture conditions and genetic modification techniques in these
   organisms is needed to generate robust new strains for profitable
   economic use. Results: In this work, we describe a new strategy for
   random mutation of genomic DNA in the microalgaeNannochloropsis
   oceanicaby insertion of a Transposome complex Tn5. This complex contains
   an antibiotic-resistance cassette commanded by a CMV viral promoter that
   allows high efficiency of transformation and the generation of mutants.
   This strategy, complemented with a large-scale identification and
   selection system for mutants, such as flow cytometry with cell
   selection, allowed us to obtain clonal cultures of mutants with altered
   phenotypes in the accumulation of intracellular lipids. The
   characterization of some of these mutants uncovered new genes that are
   likely to be involved in the regulation of lipid synthesis, revealing
   possible cellular responses that influence the intracellular homeostasis
   of lipids. Conclusion: The strategies proposed here are easy to
   implement in different types of microalgae and provide a promising
   scenario for improving biotechnological applications.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) in different ecosystems have consistently
   been acknowledged as a global issue due to toxicity, human health
   implications, and potential role in generating and disseminating
   antimicrobial resistance. The existing wastewater treatment system is
   incompetent at eliminating ECs since the effluent water contains
   significant concentrations of ECs,viz., antibiotics (0.03-13.0 mug L-1),
   paracetamol (50 mug L-1), and many others in varying concentrations.
   Microalgae are considered as a prospective and sustainable candidate for
   mitigating of ECs owing to some peculiar features. In addition, the
   microalgal-based processes also offer cost and energy-efficient
   solutions for the bioremediation of ECs than conventional treatment
   systems. It is pertinent that, microalgal-based processes also provides
   waste valorization benefits as microalgal biomass obtained after ECs
   treatment can be potentially applied to generate biofuels. Moreover,
   microalgae can effectively utilize alternative metabolic (cometabolism)
   routes for enhanced degradation of ECs. Additionally, the ECs removal
   via the microalgal biodegradation route is highly promising as it can
   transform the ECs into less toxic compounds. The present review
   comprehensively discusses different mechanisms involved in removing ECs
   and various factors that affect their removal. Also, the technoeconomic
   feasibility of microalgae than other conventional wastewater treatment
   methods is summarised. The review also highlighted the different
   molecular and genetic tools that can augment the activity and robustness
   of microalgae for better removal of organic contaminants. Finally, we
   have summarised the challenges and future research required towards
   microalgal-based bioremediation of emerging contaminants (ECs) as a
   holistic approach.

   platforms. Microalgae have re-emerged as a popular feedstock for the
   production of biofuels and other more valuable products. Even though
   integrated microalgal production systems have some clear advantages and
   present a promising alternative to highly controversial first generation
   biofuel systems, the associated hype has often exceeded the boundaries
   of reality. With a growing number of recent analyses demonstrating that
   despite the hype, these systems are conceptually sound and potentially

   that are key to attaining economic reality and the future development of

AB The high productivity of oil biosynthesized by microalgae has attracted
   increasing attention in recent years. Due to the application of such
   oils in jet fuels, the algal biosynthetic pathway toward oil components
   has been extensively researched. However, the utilization of the residue
   from algal cells after oil extraction has been overlooked. This residue
   is mainly composed of carbohydrates (starch), and so we herein describe
   the novel processes available for the production of useful chemicals
   from algal biomass-derived sugars. In particular, this review highlights
   our latest research in generating lactic acid and levulinic acid
   derivatives from polysaccharides and monosaccharides using homogeneous
   catalysts. Furthermore, based on previous reports, we discuss the
   potential of heterogeneous catalysts for application in such processes.

AB Background: Nowadays, bioflocculation is considered as a potential
   technology that could be able to alleviate microalgae dewatering cost
   regarded as the cornerstone hindrance of their full-scale application.
   However, most bioflocculation studies reported are laboratory scales.
   This study examined a pilot-scale and in situ flocculation of freshwater
   microalgaeDesmodesmus brasiliensisby microbial bioflocculant.
   Biochemical composition of microalgal biomass was analyzed to evaluate
   the applicability of bioflocculation for microalgae-based biofuel
   production. Results: The flocculation efficiency >98% was achieved at
   both pilot-scale and in situ treatment. Bioflocculation is simple,
   effective, economic, and environmentally friendly. Even though total
   proteins recovered from biomass harvested by centrifugation and that
   harvested by bioflocculation were significantly different, there was no
   significant difference in total carbohydrates and total lipids recovered
   from either biomass harvested by centrifugation or biomass harvested by
   bioflocculation. Conclusion: The results herein presented, doubtlessly
   demonstrated that the gamma-PGA bioflocculant produced byBacillus
   licheniformisCGMCC 2876 is applicable for commercial-scale microalgae
   harvesting. In addition, bioflocculation process cost could greatly be
   reduced by in situ operation as no investment cost is needed for a
   separate flocculation tank and mixing device. Furthermore,
   bioflocculation method developed is a worthy microalgae harvesting
   method for algal-based biofuel production.

AB Background: Harnessing the halotolerant characteristics of microalgae
   provides a viable alternative for sustainable biomass and
   triacylglyceride (TAG) production.Scenedesmussp. IITRIND2 is a fast
   growing fresh water microalga that has the capability to thrive in high
   saline environments. To understand the microalga's adaptability, we
   studied its physiological and metabolic flexibility by studying
   differential protein, metabolite and lipid expression profiles using
   metabolomics, proteomics, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and
   lipidomics under high salinity conditions. Results: On exposure to
   salinity, the microalga rewired its cellular reserves and
   ultrastructure, restricted the ions channels, and modulated its surface
   potential along with secretion of extrapolysaccharide to maintain
   homeostasis and resolve the cellular damage. The algal-omics studies
   suggested a well-organized salinity-driven metabolic adjustment by the
   microalga starting from increasing the negatively charged lipids, up
   regulation of proline and sugars accumulation, followed by direction of
   carbon and energy flux towards TAG synthesis. Furthermore, the omics
   studies indicated both de-novo and lipid cycling pathways at work for
   increasing the overall TAG accumulation inside the microalgal cells.
   Conclusion: The salt response observed here is unique and is different
   from the well-known halotolerant microalga;Dunaliella salina, implying
   diversity in algal response with species. Based on the integrated
   algal-omics studies, four potential genetic targets belonging to two
   different metabolic pathways (salt tolerance and lipid production) were
   identified, which can be further tested in non-halotolerant algal
   strains.

AB The advent of the green revolution boosted agricultural practices' use
   to suffice the food demand. However, due to their highly accumulative
   and permanent nature, the repeated use of pesticides caused significant
   environmental problems. Microalgae technology has recently made enormous
   progress in the effective treatments of contamination from pesticides.
   This chapter brings introductory insights on pesticides and their
   inevitable need in agricultural practices to control pest's population.
   The global pesticide market share according to geographic region and
   their commercial consumption by the key manufacturers are discussed
   briefly. Based on previous research, the metabolic pathways involved in
   pesticide elimination are outlined in this chapter. Different strategies
   employed to increase the capability of algae to extract pesticides are
   discussed. Also, the reuse of algae biomass after pesticide removal for
   charcoal production and biodiesel production was also studied. Besides,
   we discuss probable future research lines to show the prospects for
   microalgae research in pesticide removal and value-added product
   manufacture.

AB Cyanobacteria have efficient carbon concentration mechanisms and
   suppress photorespiration in response to inorganic carbon (Ci)
   limitation. We studied intracellular Ci limitation in the slow-growing
   CO2/HCO3--uptake mutant &Delta;ndhD3(forNADH dehydrogenase subunit
   D3)/ndhD4(forNADH dehydrogenase subunit D4)/cmpA(forbicarbonate
   transport system substrate-binding protein A)/sbtA(forsodium-dependent
   bicarbonate transporter A): &Delta;4mutant ofSynechocystissp. PCC 6803.
   When cultivated under high-CO2conditions, &Delta;4phenocopies wild-type
   metabolic and transcriptomic acclimation responses after the shift from
   high to low CO2supply. The &Delta;4phenocopy reveals multiple
   compensation mechanisms and differs from the preacclimation of the
   transcriptional Ci regulator mutant DeltandhR(forndhF3 operon
   transcriptional regulator). Contrary to the carboxysomeless
   &Delta;ccmM(forcarbon dioxide concentrating mechanism protein M) mutant,
   the metabolic photorespiratory burst triggered by shifting to low CO2is
   not enhanced in &Delta;4. However, levels of the photorespiratory
   intermediates 2-phosphoglycolate and glycine are increased under high
   CO2. The number of carboxysomes is increased in &Delta;4under
   high-CO2conditions and appears to be the major contributing factor for
   the avoidance of photorespiration under intracellular Ci limitation. The
   Delta4phenocopy is associated with the deregulation of Ci control, an
   overreduced cellular state, and limited photooxidative stress. Our data
   suggest multiple layers of Ci regulation, including inversely regulated
   modules of antisense RNAs and cognate target messenger RNAs and specific
   trans-acting small RNAs, such as the posttranscriptional PHOTOSYNTHESIS
   REGULATORY RNA1 (PsrR1), which shows increased expression in Delta4and
   is involved in repressing many photosynthesis genes at the
   posttranscriptional level. In conclusion, our insights extend the
   knowledge on the range of compensatory responses ofSynechocystissp. PCC
   6803 to intracellular Ci limitation and may become a valuable reference
   for improving biofuel production in cyanobacteria, in which Ci is
   channeled off from central metabolism and may thus become a limiting
   factor.

AB Algae play a significant role in the global carbon cycle by utilizing
   photosynthesis to efficiently convert solar energy and atmospheric
   carbon dioxide into various chemical compounds, notably carbohydrates,
   pigments, lipids, and released oxygen, making them a unique sustainable
   cellular factory. Algae mostly consist of carbohydrates, which include a
   broad variety of structures that contribute to their distinct physical
   and chemical properties such as degree of polymerization, side chain,
   branching, degree of sulfation, hydrogen bond etc., these features play
   a crucial role in regulating many biological activity, nutritional and
   pharmaceutical properties. Algal carbohydrates have not received enough
   attention in spite of their distinctive structural traits linked to
   certain biological and physicochemical properties. Nevertheless, it is
   anticipated that there will be a significant increase in the near future
   due to increasing demand, sustainable source, biofuel generation and
   their bioactivity. This is facilitated by the abundance of easily
   accessible information on the structural data and distinctive
   characteristics of these biopolymers. This review delves into the
   different types of saccharides such as agar, alginate, fucoidan,
   carrageenan, ulvan, EPS and glucans synthesized by various macroalgal
   and microalgal systems, which include intracellular, extracellular and
   cell wall saccharides. Their structure, biosynthetic pathway, sources,
   production strategies and their applications in various field such as
   nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, biomedicine, food and feed, cosmetics,
   and bioenergy are also elaborately discussed. Algal polysaccharide has
   huge a scope for exploitation in future due to their application in food
   and pharmaceutical industry and it can become a huge source of capital
   and income.

AB Population and pollution make notable contributions to introducing novel
   sophisticated techniques. From vehicles to industries, the release of
   CO2 into the atmosphere and wastewater into the running water streams
   are key concerns. On the other hand, the population is responsible for
   the rapid manufacturing of all commercial goods. Microalgae are the only
   answer accessible for the aforementioned difficulties. Similar to
   plants, microalgae need CO2 and light to thrive and produce a variety of
   bioproducts such as carbohydrates, protein, lipids, vitamins, sterols,
   pigments, and silica. Physical (light, temperature, CO2, and UV),
   chemical (nutrient addition or depletion), enzymatic, and metabolic
   pathway reconfiguration, as well as indoor or outdoor growing, are
   highly regarded among the several optimization strategies to make
   desired products. Wastewater pollution is rectified by growing
   microalgae in nutrient-rich organic water for their growth, which is
   used to accelerate bioproducts. This review considers the use of
   bioproducts in food, animal and aquatic feed, fertilizer, biofuel,
   medicinal and nutraceutical sectors. This paper also provides different
   optimization strategies, which include physical and chemical means of
   extraction methods for enhancing bioactive products. Challenges and
   future recommendations for enhancing target bioproducts are discussed to
   overcome environmental issues.

AB Microalgae have received considerable attention due to several
   applications in which they can be used, such as bioremediation and the
   production of high-value products. Microalgal biomass is known for its
   richness and variety of bioproducts such as lipids, carbohydrates,
   proteins, pigments and antioxidants. They can be used for several
   purposes, for example, in the production of biofuels, food nutrition
   (human and animal), pharmacology and cosmetology. However, despite the
   importance of these applications, there are still certain difficulties
   to produce microalgae bioproducts in large-scale. The high general cost
   of microalgal production is one of the major disadvantages, since
   cultivation, extraction and biorefining steps are necessary.
   Unfortunately, these processes are frequently not compensated by the
   final product sales price. The identification of the target compounds
   present in biomass as well as the costs involved in these steps are
   necessary to promote microalgal development for agricultural, commercial
   and industrial applications. To focus on the main aspects related to the
   bioproducts present in biomass, this review aims to demonstrate the main
   concepts regarding bioproducts and microalgae, the relevant data about
   the sectors of application, and the main challenges and perspectives
   associated with these subjects by using bibliometric mapping.

   ofMicractinium pusillummicroalgae to mitigate CO2and produce bioenergy
   in semi-continuous mode. Microalgae were exposed to temperatures (15,
   25, and 35°C) and light intensities (50, 350, and 650 mumol m-2s-1),
   including two temperature cycles, 25°C had the maximum growth rate, with
   no significant difference at 35°C and light intensities of 350 and 650
   mumol m-2s-1. 15°C temperature and 50 mumol m-2s-1light intensity
   reduced growth. Increased light intensity accelerated growth,
   CO2utilization with carbon and bioenergy accumulation. Microalgae
   demonstrate rapid primary metabolic adjustment and acclimation reactions
   in response to changes in light and temperature conditions. Temperature
   correlated positively with carbon and nitrogen fixation, CO2fixation,
   and carbon accumulation in the biomass, whereas there was no correlation
   found between light. In the temperature regime experiment, higher light
   intensity boosted nutrient and CO2utilization, carbon buildup, and

U1 1
U2 49
AB The intensive cultivation of microalgae is an alternative for the
   sustainable and clean production of energy, protein, and pigments,
   particularly when associated with agribusiness and wastewater treatment.
   Intensive microalgae cultivation aims to mitigate environmental risks
   and microalgae by-products add value to the production chain. However,
   studies on the microalgae production chain in Brazil are few. Thus, the
   aim of this study was to review the Brazilian microalgae production
   chain (BMPC) and suggest alternatives for its consolidation. Its
   structure was mapped, showing how BMPC public research funds, research,
   development and innovation, publications, patents, and companies are
   linked. State-of-the-art research on microalgae was analyzed using the
   research database from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and
   Technological Development. Information on the number of documents
   published was evaluated using the Scopus database and patent information
   was gathered from World Intellectual Property Organization database,
   Latin American Patent Bank and National Institute for Industrial
   Property. Despite microalgae research initiatives in Brazil, which have
   leveraged several research groups and generated patents, the
   dissemination of this knowledge to companies appears limited and is
   restricted to only a few regions in the country. Furthermore, Brazil has
   neither regionalized alignment of microalgae supplies and demand nor any
   organization or adequate interaction among stakeholders. The high cost
   of producing the raw material and the lack of organizations representing
   the sector are the primary barriers to the yet incipient Brazilian
   microalgae production chain. Likewise, a main challenge for
   consolidation and development of the production chain concerns the
   representative organization of the microalgae sector through the
   creation of associations.

AB Environmental contamination by heavy metals poses significant threats to
   terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, necessitating the development of
   effective remediation strategies. Conventional methods for heavy metal
   removal exhibit limitations, including inadequate efficiency and
   elevated costs. In this context, microalgae have emerged as a promising
   bioremediation approach due to their robust metal-binding capabilities,
   specifically through biosorption. This review comprehensively examines
   the role of microalgae in addressing heavy metal pollution, with a
   primary focus on their effective removal from wastewater. Microalgae
   offer wastewater purification potential across diverse sources and
   capitalize on wastewater as a growth matrix, yielding valuable
   bioproducts, biomaterials, and bioenergy. Their versatility allows them
   to thrive in various wastewaters, facilitating effective contaminant
   removal. This study also investigates the application of microalgae in
   decentralized water treatment systems (DWTSs), where the decentralized
   nature of these systems proves advantageous in addressing heavy metal
   contaminants directly at the point of generation or use. This approach
   holds particular significance in regions where centralized systems face
   obstacles due to geographical constraints, inadequate infrastructure, or
   financial limitations. DWTSs not only provide a decentralized solution
   for heavy metals removal but also prove advantageous in disaster relief
   scenarios and rapidly growing urban areas.

AB Microalgal biomass is the third-generation promising feedstock for
   production of biofuel and other valuable goods. The raw microalgal
   biomass and residues have low calorific value, high moisture, and high
   H/C and O/C atomic ratio which not suitable to use as solid fuel and
   many engineering applications. Torrefaction is a promising technique to
   upgrade microalgal biomass closed to solid coal properties by increasing
   the calorific value of microalgal biochar. However, the overview of
   torrefaction process for microalgal biochar is lacking in the literature
   study. Thus, an overview of recent dry and wet torrefaction of
   microalgal biomass is presented in this review. Wet torrefaction is a
   new technology for microalgal biochar production because it has some
   advantages compare with other pre-treatment methods. Besides, this
   review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research for
   fuel property of microalgal biochar after torrefaction process.
   Different torrefaction temperature, gases and holding time lead to
   various solid yield, energy yield and calorific value of biochar are
   comprehensively discussed. In addition, the used of microalgal biochar
   as bio-adsorbent to remove pollutants in wastewater are included as
   well. In short, this is a comprehensive summary of recent torrefaction
   technology for microalgal biochar as fuel.

AB Algae are microscopic photosynthetic prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms
   that can naturally grow in fresh or marine water in the presence of
   sunlight. Algae are capable of sequestering CO2and utilize nutrients
   like nitrates, phosphates, and other micronutrients in water to increase
   their body mass. In the past few decades, algal biomass has been
   investigated by the scientific community because of its promising
   applications in producing renewable food, feed, fuels, and chemicals.
   Additionally, microalgae's ability to fix large amounts of greenhouse
   gas (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2) has led researchers to
   investigate microalgae as an alternative way of combating climate change
   by sequestering flue gas containing CO2emitted from industries such as
   coal power plants, cement, steel, and petroleum refineries. This review
   outlines different sources of CO2emissions and capturing technology
   including microalgae. Details about the methods of cultivating and
   separating the algal biomass followed by thermochemical and biochemical
   conversion to fuels/chemicals, microalgae-derived bioplastics, and
   microalgae biomass blended plastic are outlined in this review.
   Commercially viable continuous and semi-continuous biorefining processes
   such as hydrothermal flash hydrolysis and environmental benefits of
   using microalgae as carbon sinks and wastewater treatment are also
   provided.

AB As we march into the 21st century, the prevailing scenario of depleting
   energy resources, global warming and ever increasing issues of human
   health and food security will quadruple. In this context, genetic and
   metabolic engineering of green microalgae complete the quest toward a
   continuum of environmentally clean fuel and food production.
   Evolutionarily related, but unlike land plants, microalgae need nominal
   land or water, and are best described as unicellular autotrophs using
   light energy to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into algal biomass,
   mitigating fossil CO2 pollution in the process. Remarkably, a feature
   innate to most microalgae is synthesis and accumulation of lipids
   (60-65% of dry weight), carbohydrates and secondary metabolites like
   pigments and vitamins, especially when grown under abiotic stress
   conditions. Particularly fruitful, such an application of abiotic stress
   factors such as nitrogen starvation, salinity, heat shock, etc., can be
   used in a biorefinery concept for production of multiple valuable
   products. The focus of this mini-review underlies metabolic
   reorientation practices and tolerance mechanisms as applied to green
   microalgae under specific stress stimuli for a sustainable
   pollution-free future. Moreover, we entail current progress on genetic
   engineering as a promising tool to grasp adaptive processes for
   improving strains with potential biotechnological interests.

AB Cell disruption is one of the most critical steps affecting the economy
   and yields of biotechnological processes for producing biofuels from
   microalgae. Enzymatic cell disruption has shown competitive results
   compared to mechanical or chemical methods. However, the addition of
   enzymes implies an associated cost in the overall production process.
   Recent studies have employed algicidal microorganisms to perform
   enzymatic cell disruption and degradation of microalgae biomass in order
   to reduce this associated cost. Algicidal microorganisms induce
   microalgae growth inhibition, death and subsequent lysis. Secreted
   algicidal molecules and enzymes produced by bacteria, cyanobacteria,
   viruses and the microalga themselves that are capable of inducing algal
   death are classified, and the known modes of action are described along
   with insights into cell-to-cell interaction and communication. This
   review aims to provide information regarding microalgae degradation by
   microorganisms and secreted algicidal substances that would be useful
   for microalgae cell breakdown in biofuels production processes. A better
   understanding of algae-to-algae communication and the specific
   mechanisms of algal cell lysis is expected to be an important
   breakthrough for the broader application of algicidal microorganisms in
   biological cell disruption and the production of biofuels from
   microalgae biomass.

   potential of microalgae-enhanced wastewater treatment for an existing
   WWTP (32,000 PE) in Central Germany. For WWTP-dimensioning and
   determination of energy-rich biomasses for anaerobic digestion and CHP,
   actual influent load data was used and calculation was carried out
   according to valid regulations. Algae growth figures are based on
   pilot-scale test series from Germany and correspond to the relevant

AB Lower energy consumption for producing feed pellets is an important part
   of the economy in the feed mill. The same is if physical pellet quality
   is degraded. The interest in using of novel ingredients is increasing
   due to requirements for the sustainable development goals. Defatted
   microalgae as by-product from biodiesel production is one of many novel
   ingredients. The purpose of this experiment was to understand how the
   addition of small amount of enzymes can reduce the flow resistance in
   the die during pellet discharge, without affecting the physical quality
   of pellets. Thus, possibly reduce the total consumption of electrical
   energy during compaction. Three enzymes, phytase, protease, xylanase,
   and combinations of those were added to defattedDesmodesmus
   subspicatusmicroalgae at 3 inclusion levels. Feed enzymes xylanase and
   phytase helped lowering the flow resistance of the material in the die.
   Reduction of flow resistance was in average 17 times lover when all
   three levels of enzyme phytase were used. The same was observed when
   0.01% xylanase was added. All feed enzymes and their combination have
   evidently lowered underwater pellet swelling due to their hydrolytic
   activity at the surface of the microalgal particles. The hydrolytic
   activities of the feed enzymes did not affect hardness of the microalgal
   pellets. Contact angle degree between pellet surface and oil droplet was
   lowered when xylanase and protease was used at all three dosage levels.
   However, contact angle degree between pellet surface and water droplets
   was unaffected by the hydrolytic activity of enzymes.

AB This article presents an engineering study of an integrated system to
   produce bio-oil from microalgae biomass. The analysis is based on a
   pilot plant located at Minami-soma Fukushima, Japan, which further
   simulates 1 ha based-cultivation. Municipal wastewater and flue gases
   were utilized as nutrient sources for the microalgae culture of the
   proposed design. A flow sheet diagram of the integrated plant was
   synthesized by process engineering software to allow simulation of a
   continuous system. The design and sizing of the process equipment were
   performed to obtain a realistic estimation of possible production cost.
   The results demonstrated that nutrient savings was achieved by
   wastewater and CO2 utilization to the polyculture of native microalgae.
   Process simulation gave an estimated CO2 sequestration of 82.77 to
   140.58 tons ha-1year-1 with 63 to 107 tons ha-1 year-1 of potential
   biomass production. The integrated process significantly improved the
   energy balance and economics of biofuel production and also the
   wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The economic analysis confirmed that
   higher biomass production and technology improvement were required to
   achieve operational feasibility and profitability of the current
   microalgae-based bio-oil production.

AB Global energy is undergoing a transformation driven by the imperative to
   mitigate climate impact, enhance energy security, and promote
   sustainable development. Biofuel production has emerged as a promising
   alternative to fossil fuels, offering renewable and environmentally
   sustainable sources of energy. Biofuels are derived from organic
   materials such as crops, agricultural residues, forestry waste, and
   microorganisms, which undergo conversion processes to produce liquid or
   gaseous fuels suitable for transportation, heating, and electricity
   generation. Th is study aims to maximi ze the production of biomass,
   protein, lipid and carbohydrate in a newly isolated micr oalga,
   Tetradesmus obliquus RESP2 cultivated using a combination of municipal
   waste water and Bold's Basal Medium (BBM). The experimental design
   involved at varying the composition of growth medium to determine the
   most optimal conditions for algal growth and biochemical accumulation.
   After thorough experimentation and analysis, the results revealed that
   the optimal combination of waste water and BBM medium (75%:25%) yielded
   a maximum concentration of biomass 16.2 g/L, lipid 5.53 g/L,
   carbohydrate 1.48 g/L and protein 4.48 g/L. These findings demonstrate
   the efficacy of utilizing municipal wastewater as a nutrient source in
   combination with BBM medium for the cultivation of T. obliquus The
   optimized conditions identified in this study hold promise for enhancing
   the efficiency and sustainability of microalgae based biofuel production
   processes.

AB Background: The production of biofuels in photosynthetic microalgae and
   cyanobacteria is a promising alternative to the generation of fuels from
   fossil resources. To be economically competitive, producer strains need
   to be established that synthesize the targeted product at high yield and
   over a long time. Engineering cyanobacteria into forced fuel producers
   should considerably interfere with overall cell homeostasis, which in
   turn might counteract productivity and sustainability of the process.
   Therefore, in-depth characterization of the cellular response upon
   long-term production is of high interest for the targeted improvement of
   a desired strain. Results: The transcriptome-wide response to continuous
   ethanol production was examined inSynechocystissp. PCC6803 using high
   resolution microarrays. In two independent experiments, ethanol
   production rates of 0.0338% (v/v) ethanol d-1and 0.0303% (v/v) ethanol
   d-1were obtained over 18 consecutive days, measuring two sets of
   biological triplicates in fully automated photobioreactors. Ethanol
   production caused a significant (40%) delay in biomass accumulation, the
   development of a bleaching phenotype and a down-regulation of light
   harvesting capacity. However, microarray analyses performed at day 4, 7,
   11 and 18 of the experiment revealed only three mRNAs with a strongly
   modified accumulation level throughout the course of the experiment. In
   addition to the overexpressedadhA(slr1192) gene, this was an
   approximately 4 fold reduction incpcB(sll1577) and 3 to 6 fold increase
   inrps8(sll1809) mRNA levels. Much weaker modifications of expression
   level or modifications restricted to day 18 of the experiment were
   observed for genes involved in carbon assimilation (Ribulose
   bisphosphate carboxylase and Glutamate decarboxylase). Molecular
   analysis of the reducedcpcBlevels revealed a post-transcriptional
   processing of thecpcBAoperon mRNA leaving a truncated mRNAcpcA* likely
   not competent for translation. Moreover, western blots and zinc-enhanced
   bilin fluorescence blots confirmed a severe reduction in the amounts of
   both phycocyanin subunits, explaining the cause of the bleaching
   phenotype. Conclusions: Changes in gene expression upon induction of
   long-term ethanol production inSynechocystissp. PCC6803 are highly
   specific. In particular, we did not observe a comprehensive stress
   response as might have been expected.

AB In response to the energy crisis, global warming and climate change,
   microalgae have received a lot of attention as a promising feedstock for
   the production of biofuels. However, microalgal biofuels are still
   unaffordable due to low productivity and their substantial requirements
   in capital investment and operation costs. Much original research
   regarding the various microalgal cultivation strategies has been
   reported, in an attempt to promote microalgal biofuel production.
   However, current literature indicates the fragmented nature of
   information available regarding the strategies for the improvement of
   microalgal production for biofuel conversion. From a systematic
   perspective, this review highlights the main microalgal cultivation
   strategies for the achievement of improved biomass and biofuel
   productivity. It first discloses the current state of microalgal
   production as a biofuel feedstock, giving general introduction to the
   topic. Subsequently, it summarizes the current microalgae cultivation
   technology. Microalgal cultivation strategies are then discussed
   systematically, including integration with wastewater treatment and
   CO2mitigation, batch vs. semi-continuous vs. continuous culture,
   two-stage continuous cultivation, co-culture, stress culture, and
   microalgal cultivation with harvest water recycling. Finally, concluding
   remarks are put forward.

AB Conventional fuel resources are overburden with speedy global energy
   demand which ensued the urgent need of alternate energy resources.
   Biofuel generation efficiency of microalgae is notable due to their
   comparatively rapid biomass production rate and high oil content. But,
   the employment of microalgae as biofuel resource is in infancy due to
   low productivity and high production cost. The issues can be addressed
   by employing engineered microalgal strains that would be able to
   efficiently generate enhanced levels of biomass with augmented lipid
   and/or carbohydrate content for proficient biofuel production. Genetic
   alterations and metabolic engineering of microalgal species might be
   helpful in developing high stress-tolerant strains with improved
   properties for biofuel generation. Various omics approaches appeared
   significant to upgrade the microalgal lipid production. Intervention of
   genetic and metabolic engineering approaches would facilitate the
   development of microalgae as a competent biofuel resource and inflate
   the economic commercialization of biofuels.

AB The diversity of microalgal species is colossal; however, only a few
   species are better known and have been investigated relatively well.
   Lately, microalgae have been garnering great consideration because of
   their potential to serve as a feedstock for either biofuel or
   nutraceutical production. They have the capability of producing and
   storing desired products as cell metabolites, and adapting themselves
   when there is a change in the environmental conditions (pH, temperature,
   light, carbon dioxide, salinity, and nutrients). The current review
   focuses on how the environmental conditions, including mixing, affect
   the growth and biomass productivity of various species of microalgae.
   This baseline information is important to focus on research efforts for
   improving biomass productivity to enhance the use of algae as a
   feedstock for various industries and applications. Optimal environmental
   conditions for enhancing biomass productivity of various species of
   microalgae as well as screening and selection of microalgae species are
   also discussed.

AB Microalgae are a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms that can be
   exploited for the production of different compounds, ranging from crude
   biomass and biofuels to high value-added biochemicals and synthetic
   proteins. Traditionally, algal biotechnology relies on bioprospecting to
   identify new highly productive strains and more recently, on forward
   genetics to further enhance productivity. However, it has become clear
   that further improvements in algal productivity for biotechnology is
   impossible without combining traditional tools with the arising
   molecular genetics toolkit. We review recent advantages in developing
   high throughput screening methods, preparing genome-wide mutant
   libraries, and establishing genome editing techniques. We discuss how
   algae can be improved in terms of photosynthetic efficiency, biofuel and
   high value-added compound production. Finally, we critically evaluate
   developments over recent years and explore future potential in the
   field.

AB Microalgae are seen as the most promising flexible feedstock, being
   considered the crop of the future. They grow fast, just needing
   sunlight, carbon dioxide and minerals. They contain high value
   ingredients, such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and
   others (carotenoids and polymers). Thus, they can be produced for a wide
   range of markets, including human and animal nutrition, cosmetics,
   pharmaceuticals and biofuels. However, the production cost is still
   high, limiting their commercial applications to high-valued compounds.
   The reduction of these costs can be obtained with efficient bioreactor
   designs, which are able to achieve high areal biomass productivities. In
   this context, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) may play an important
   role in the optimization of bioreactor design, analysing the interaction
   of hydrodynamics, light supply, heat and mass transfer and biological
   kinetics. This study addresses the recent advances in CFD modelling of
   both open pond and closed bioreactors.

AB Biological pretreatment (BP) is a promising approach for treating
   microalgae and lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) during biofuels production
   that uses mostly fungal and bacterial strains or their enzymes.
   Pretreatment with fungi requires long incubation time (weeks to months),
   whereas, bacterial and enzymatic pretreatments can be completed by only
   a few hours to days. Nevertheless, fungal pretreatment especially with
   white-rot fungi (WRF) is predominantly used in BP of biomass for its
   high efficiency and downstream yields. According to the recent reports,
   delignification of LCB by WRF may vary between 3% and 72% with a maximum
   120% increase in the biofuel yield. Compared to the untreated microalgae
   biomass, the downstream yields of the respective biofuels were found to
   be increased by 22-159% after bacterial pretreatment, while enzymatic
   pretreatment improved as much as 485% of the final yield. Despite the
   results are promising, exploitation of BP on large scale is still
   bottlenecked by some technoeconomic hurdles, which need to be overcome
   through further fundamental and applied researches. This paper presents
   a comprehensive and in-depth review on BP for LCB and microalgae biomass
   by focusing on the relevant overviews and perspectives, technological
   approaches, mechanisms, influencing factors, and recent research
   progresses. Finally, challenges and future outlooks are discussed in the
   concluding sections.

AB Oils, carbohydrates, and fats generated by microalgae are being refined
   in an effort to produce biofuels. The research presented here examines
   two marine microalgae, Nannochloropsis salina (green alga) and
   Phaeodactylum tricornutum (diatom), when grown with 0 (no addition),
   0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 g L-1 NaHCO3 added to an f/2 medium during the
   growth phase (GP) and a nutrient induced (nitrate limitation) lipid
   formation phase (LP). We hypothesize that the addition of NaHCO3 is a
   sustainable and practical strategy to increase cellular density and
   concentrations of lipids in microalgae as well as the rate of lipid
   accumulation. In N. salina, final cell densities were significantly
   (p<0.05) higher in the NaHCO3-treated cells than the control while in P.
   tricornutum the cell densities were higher with >[NaHCO3] during the GP.
   During the LP, cell densities were generally higher in the
   NaHCO3-treated cells compared with controls. FV/FM (efficiency of
   photosystem II) patterns paralleled those for cell density with
   generally higher values with higher concentrations of NaHCO3 and
   significantly different values between controls and 5.0 g L-1 NaHCO3 at
   the end of the GP (p<0.05). FV/FM was variable between treatments in P.
   tricornutum (0.3-0.65) but less so in N. salina for (0.5-0.7) regardless
   of [NaHCO3]. The lipid index (measured with Nile red), used as a proxy
   for triacylglycerides (TAGs), was 10.26.5 and 4.42.9 (fluorescence
   units/OD cells *1000) for N. salina and P. tricornutum, respectively, at
   the end of the GP. At the end of the LP, the lipid index was eight and
   four times higher than during the GP in the corresponding 5.0 g L-1
   NaHCO3 treatments, revealing that N. salina was accumulating more lipid
   than P. tricornutum. Dry weights essentially doubled during LP compared
   with GP for N. salina; this was not the case for P. tricornutum. In
   general, the percentage of ash in dry weights was significantly higher
   in the LP relative to the corresponding GP treatments for P.
   tricornutum; this was not the case for N. salina. During the LP, there
   was also less soluble protein in N. salina compared to GP; differences
   were not significant in cells growing with 2.0 or 5.0 g L-1 NaHCO3. In
   P. tricornutum, faster growing cells had more soluble protein during the
   GP and LP; differences between treatments were significant. P.
   tricornutum generally accumulated significantly more crude protein than
   N. salina at higher [NaHCO3]; there was three times more crude protein
   in the highest NaHCO3 (5.0 g L-1) treatment compared with the controls.
   C:N ratios (mol:mol) were similar across treatments during GP: 7.030.12
   and 10.160.41 for N. salina and P. tricornutum, respectively. Further,
   C:N ratios increased with increasing [NaHCO3] during LP.
   Species-specific fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs) profiles were observed.
   While C16:0 was lower in P. tricornutum compared to N. salina, the
   diatom produced more C16:1 and C14 but not C18:3. Monounsaturated fatty
   acids (MUFA) significantly increased in N. salina in the LP compared to
   GP and in response to increasing [NaHCO3] (t tests; p<0.05). Saturated
   fatty acids (SFA) responded similarly but to a lesser degree. There were
   more polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in N. salina than MUFAs or SFAs.
   In P. tricornutum, there were generally more SFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs in P.
   tricornutum during LP than GP in the corresponding NaHCO3 treatments.
   These findings reveal the importance of considering NaHCO3 as a
   supplemental carbon source in the culturing marine phytoplankton in
   large-scale production for biofuels.

AB Energy consumption and environmental pollution made biodiesel production
   from microalgae a hot spot. Comprehensive utilization of microalgae by
   simultaneously extracting carotenoid and oil, can effectively reduce the
   production cost of microalgae biodiesel. Although carotenoids are
   important active substances, little has been known about carotenoid
   biosynthesis and its metabolic regulation in microalgae so far. In order
   to better understand and manipulate carotenoid metabolism for
   enhancement of carotenoid production in microalgae, presented an
   overview of research advances on carotenoid biosynthesis and its
   metabolic regulation in microalgae were presented, including carotenoid
   biosynthesis pathway, strategies for improving carotenoid
   accumulation(biochemical regulation, mutagenesis and genetic engineering
   strategy). Effects of environmental factors on carotenoid accumulation
   were illustrated. Two genetic engineering strategies were summarized,
   including enhancement of expression of key enzyme genes in carotenoid
   biosynthesis pathway, enhancement of expression of transcription factor
   genes related to regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. The
   prospect of research on carotenoid metabolism was also discussed in
   microalgae.

AB Microalgae are promising feedstocks for food, feed, fuel, fertilizers,
   fine chemicals and other value-added products, and are considered of
   great potential in wastewater treatment. Convenient acquisition of the
   cultivated microalgal biomass or easy separation of microalgae from the
   treated effluents, however, are the prerequisites of these applications.
   Biomass harvesting and dewatering in traditional suspended cultivation
   systems are costly and energy intensive, since volumes of liquid medium
   needs to be separated from the obtained diluted microalgal biomass.
   Attached systems can effectively overcome such limitations by
   introducing substratum into the liquid medium for microalgae attachment,
   and the attached biomass with magnitudes higher solid content can be
   collected via simple and straightforward harvesting methods such as
   mechanical scraping. As an emerging field with less than ten years of
   research history, systematic information on microalgae attachment and
   attached systems for biomass production and wastewater treatment has not
   been thoroughly reviewed. This review, therefore, analyzed the two-step
   mechanisms of microalgae attachment, discussed the influencing factors
   of attached microalgal growth including properties of substratum,
   properties of microalgal cells, turbulence of liquid medium, frequency
   of biomass harvesting, etc., and their possible impacts on microalgal
   biofilm formation and biomass production in attached systems.
   Classification of attached microalgal systems based on different
   criteria such as substratum orientation, relative position of microalgal
   cells and the culturing medium, system scales and culturing medium, was
   summarized. Performances of attached microalgal systems for biomass
   production and wastewater treatment were evaluated, with commonly used
   parameters identified and compared as well. Recommendations for future
   theoretical research and practical applications were also addressed in
   the manuscript. This review could offer much useful information on
   microalgal attachment and attached systems for biomass production and
   wastewater treatment, and may serve as guidance for future studies in
   related fields.

AB Algal biofuel production offers great potential as a sustainable source
   of bioenergy without competing for arable land with food crops. However,
   many challenges must be overcome to enable this to be done commercially
   at the scale required to produce biofuels. Here we explain how an
   understanding of algal ecology could lead to more reliable raceway-based
   microalgal cultivation, drawing from established principles of community
   ecology to highlight practices that could be applied to protect algal
   cultures from unwanted contaminants. Using theoretical concepts, we show
   how an understanding of local community dynamics at the species level
   might be used to enhance productivity by encouraging certain community
   structures over others.

AB Background This study aimed at exploring the molecular physiological
   consequences of a major redirection of carbon flow in so-called
   cyanobacterial cell factories: quantitative whole-cell proteomics
   analyses were carried out on two14N-labelledSynechocystismutant strains,
   relative to their15N-labelled wild-type counterpart. Each mutant strain
   overproduced one specific commodity product, i.e. ethanol or lactic
   acid, to such an extent that the majority of the incoming CO2in the
   organism was directly converted into the product. Results: In total, 267
   proteins have been identified with a significantly up- or down-regulated
   expression level. In the ethanol-producing mutant, which had the highest
   relative direct flux of carbon-to-product (>65%), significant
   up-regulation of several components involved in the initial stages of
   CO2fixation for cellular metabolism was detected. Also a general
   decrease in abundance of the protein synthesizing machinery of the cells
   and a specific induction of an oxidative stress response were observed
   in this mutant. In the lactic acid overproducing mutant, that expresses
   part of the heterologous L-lactate dehydrogenase from a self-replicating
   plasmid, specific activation of two CRISPR associated proteins, encoded
   on the endogenous pSYSA plasmid, was observed. RT-qPCR was used to
   measure, of nine of the genes identified in the proteomics studies, also
   the adjustment of the corresponding mRNA level. Conclusion: The most
   striking adjustments detected in the proteome of the engineered cells
   were dependent on the specific product formed, with, e.g. more stress
   caused by lactic acid - than by ethanol production. Up-regulation of the
   total capacity for CO2fixation in the ethanol-producing strain was due
   to hierarchical-rather than metabolic regulation. Furthermore,
   plasmid-based expression of heterologous gene(s) may induce genetic
   instability. For selected, limited, number of genes a striking
   correlation between the respective mRNA - and the corresponding protein
   expression level was observed, suggesting that for the expression of
   these genes regulation takes place primarily at the level of gene
   transcription.

   products through metabolic engineering. Optimisation of
   metabolic-engineered organisms for high-level sustained production of
   product is a key element in the manipulation of this organism. A
   limitation to the utilisation of
   metabolically-engineeredSynechocystisPCC6803 is the availability of
   strong controllable promoters and stable gene dosage methods for
   maximising gene expression and subsequent product formation following
   genetic manipulation. Results: A nativeSynechocystisPCC6803 small
   plasmid, pCA2.4, is consistently maintained at a copy level of up to 7
   times that of the polyploid chromosome. As this plasmid is stable during
   cell division, it is potentially an ideal candidate for maximising gene
   dosage levels within the organism. Here, we describe the construction of
   a novel expression vector generated from the native plasmid, pCA2.4. To
   investigate the feasibility of this new expression system, a yellow
   fluorescent protein (YFP) encoding gene was cloned downstream of the
   strong Ptrc promoter and integrated into a predicted neutral site within
   the pCA2.4 plasmid. The stability of the integrated construct was
   monitored over time compared to a control strain containing an identical
   YFP-expressing construct integrated at a known neutral site in a
   chromosomal location. Conclusions: A significantly higher fluorescence
   level of the yellow fluorescent protein was observed when its encoded
   gene was integrated into the pCA2.4 native plasmid when compared to the
   isogenic chromosomally integrated control strain. On average, a minimum
   of 20-fold higher fluorescence level could be achieved from integration
   into the native plasmid. Fluorescence was also monitored as a function
   of culture time and demonstrated to be stable over multiple sub-cultures
   even after the removal of selective pressure. Therefore, the native
   small plasmid, pCA2.4 may be utilised to stably increase gene expression
   levels inSynechocystisPCC6803. With the complementary utilisation of an
   inducible promoter system, rapid generation of
   commodity-producingSynechocystisPCC6803 strains having high level,
   controlled expression may be more achievable.

AB Microalgae with wide range of commercial applications have attracted a
   lot of attention of the researchers in the last few decades. However,
   microalgae utilization is not economically sustainable due to high cost
   of harvesting. A wide range of solid-liquid separation techniques are
   available for microalgae harvesting. The techniques include coagulation
   and flocculation, flotation, centrifugation and filtration or a
   combination of various techniques. Despite the importance of harvesting
   to the economics and energy balance, there is no universal harvesting
   technique for microalgae. Therefore, this review focuses on assessing
   technical, economical and application potential of various harvesting
   techniques so as to allow selection of an appropriate technology for
   cost effectively harvesting of microalgae from their culture medium.
   Various harvesting and concentrating techniques of microalgae were
   reviewed to suggest order of suitability of the techniques for four main
   microalgae applications i.e biofuel, human and animal food, high valued
   products, and water quality restoration. For deciding the order of
   suitability, a comparative analysis of various harvesting techniques
   based on the six common criterions (i.e biomass quality, cost, biomass
   quantity, processing time, species specific and toxicity) has been done.
   Based on the order of various techniques vis-a-vis various criteria and
   preferred order of criteria for various applications, order of
   suitability of harvesting techniques for various applications has been
   decided. Among various harvesting techniques, coagulation and
   flocculation, centrifugation and filtration were found to be most
   suitable for considered applications. These techniques may be used alone
   or in combination for increasing the harvesting efficiency.

AB Green, red, brown, and diatomic algae, as well as cyanobacteria, have
   been in the focus of attention of scientists and technologists for over
   5 decades. This is due to their importance as efficient and economical
   producers of food additives, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofertilizers,
   biofuels, and wastewater bioremediation agents. Recently, the role of
   microalgae has increasingly been considered in terms of their probiotic
   function, i.e., of their ability to normalize the functioning of the
   microbiota of humans and agricultural animals and to produce
   biologically active substances, including hormones, neurotransmitters,
   and immunostimulators. A separate brief subsection of the review deals
   with the potential functions of microalgae with respect to the brain and
   psyche, i.e., as psychobiotics. Moreover, algal polysaccharides and some
   other compounds can be broken down to short fragments that will
   stimulate the development of useful intestinal microorganisms, i.e.,
   function as efficient prebiotics. Finally, many components of microalgal
   cells and chemical agents produced by them can exert important
   health-promoting effects per se, which indicates that they are as
   potentially valuable metabiotics (the term preferred by late Prof. B.A.
   Shenderov), which are alternatively denoted as postbiotics in the
   literature.

AB Microalgal biomass is composed of different valuable metabolites that
   can satisfy the requirements of renewable biofuels, alternative
   proteins, carbohydrates, and food grade natural colorants. Production of
   a specific product from microalgae has been proved to be economically
   infeasible on the commercial scale except for the production of
   high-value products (e.g. carotenoids and phycobiliproteins). Therefore,
   the simultaneous extraction of multiple products is essential to bring
   pragmatism for the production of biofuels, proteins, and carbohydrate
   derived products from microalgal biomass. In order to obtain multiple
   products, various strategies have been implemented using potential
   techniques of cell disruption and biomass fractionation based on the
   priorities of products. Conventional approaches of downstream processing
   have often proved to be inefficient in the case of integrated
   fractionation systems. This is attributable to the divergent nature of
   the intracellular metabolites of microalgae and their vulnerability
   toward the different chemicals and conditions of those downstream
   processes. However, three phase partitioning (TPP), aqueous two-phase
   separation, membrane separation, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE),
   and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) are some of the advanced
   techniques which have been proved to be useful in this regard. Choice of
   cell disruption mechanisms is critical for several purposes, such as the
   selective release of metabolites into a suitable solvent, preservation
   of bioactivity of molecules and cost-savings. Unfortunately,
   consolidated report for the fractionation of priority-based products
   from microalgal biomass using these techniques is lacking. Therefore, in
   this review, we have critically discussed the different strategies for
   the priority-based multiple products by implementation of the advanced
   techniques.

AB Background: Fermentation production of biofuel ethanol consumes
   agricultural crops, which will compete directly with the food supply. As
   an alternative, photosynthetic cyanobacteria have been proposed as
   microbial factories to produce ethanol directly from solar energy and
   CO2. However, the ethanol productivity from photoautotrophic
   cyanobacteria is still very low, mostly due to the low tolerance of
   cyanobacterial systems to ethanol stress. Results: To build a foundation
   necessary to engineer robust ethanol-producing cyanobacterial hosts, in
   this study we applied a quantitative transcriptomics approach with a
   next-generation sequencing technology, combined with quantitative
   reverse-transcript PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, to reveal the global metabolic
   responses to ethanol in model cyanobacterialSynechocystissp. PCC 6803.
   The results showed that ethanol exposure induced genes involved in
   common stress responses, transporting and cell envelope modification. In
   addition, the cells can also utilize enhanced polyhydroxyalkanoates
   (PHA) accumulation and glyoxalase detoxication pathway as means against
   ethanol stress. The up-regulation of photosynthesis by ethanol was also
   further confirmed at transcriptional level. Finally, we used gene
   knockout strains to validate the potential target genes related to
   ethanol tolerance. Conclusion: RNA-Seq based global transcriptomic
   analysis provided a comprehensive view of cellular response to ethanol
   exposure. The analysis provided a list of gene targets for engineering
   ethanol tolerance in cyanobacteriumSynechocystis.

AB Microalgae are the most prospective raw materials for the production of
   biofuels, pyrolysis is an effective method to convert biomass into
   bioenergy. However, biofuels derived from the pyrolysis of microalgae
   exhibit poor fuel properties due to high content of moisture and
   protein. Co-pyrolysis is a simple and efficient method to produce
   high-quality bio-oil from two or more materials. Tires, plastics, and
   bamboo waste are the optimal co-feedstocks based on the improvement of
   yield and quality of bio-oil. Moreover, adding catalysts, especially CaO
   and Cu/HZSM-5, can enhance the quality of bio-oil by increasing
   aromatics content and decreasing oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds.
   Consequently, this paper provides a critical review of the production of
   bio-oil from co-pyrolysis of microalgae with other biomass wastes.
   Meanwhile, the underlying mechanism of synergistic effects and the
   catalytic effect on co-pyrolysis are discussed. Finally, the economic
   viability and prospects of microalgae co-pyrolysis are summarized.

   requires thousands of kilowatt hours of energy. This enormous energy
   demand can be fulfilled by utilizing the microbial electrolysis route to
   breakdown organic pollutants in wastewater which produces clean water
   and biohydrogen as a by-product of the reaction. Microalgae are the
   promising microorganism for the biohydrogen production, and it has been
   investigated that the interaction between microalgae and bacteria can be
   used to boost the yield of biohydrogen. Consortium of algae and bacteria
   resulting around 50-60% more biohydrogen production compared to the

AB Algal biomass including macroalgae and microalgae show great potential
   as pyrolysis feedstock in generating energy-dense and valuable pyrolytic
   products such as bio-oil, biochar and bio-syngas. The chemical
   constituents of macroalgae and microalgae show great variations,
   especially their lipid, carbohydrate and protein contents, which could
   affect the qualities of the pyrolytic products. From the established
   conventional pyrolysis, the products produced from both macroalgae and
   microalgae show moderate energy contents (<34 MJ/kg). The review
   identifies the issues associated with development of conventional
   pyrolysis such as flash and intermediate pyrolysis. To enhance the
   production of biofuels from algal biomass, advanced or non-conventional
   pyrolysis techniques have been employed. Catalytic pyrolysis on algal
   biomass could reduce the nitrogenates and oxygenates in the biofuels. On
   top of that, co-pyrolysis with suitable feedstock shows great
   enhancement on the bio-oil yield. As for hydropyrolysis of algal
   biomass, their generated biofuels can produce up to 48 MJ/kg with high
   yield of bio-oil up to 50 wt%, comparable to conventional fuels.
   Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of algal biomass greatly shortens the
   processing time through advanced heating; however, favours the formation
   of bio-syngas by improving the yield up to 84 wt% depending on the
   feedstock used. Therefore, formation of biofuel fraction suitable for
   energy generation highly depends on the selected pyrolysis technologies.

AB Microalgal based biofuels are discussed as future sustainable energy
   source because of their higher photosynthetic and water use efficiency
   to produce biomass. In the context of climate CO2mitigation strategies,
   algal mass production is discussed as a potential CO2sequestration
   technology which uses CO2emissions to produce biomass with high-oil
   content independent on arable land. In this short review, it is
   presented how complete energy balances from photon to harvestable
   biomass can help to identify the limiting processes on the cellular
   level. The results show that high productivity is always correlated with
   high metabolic costs. The overall efficiency of biomass formation can be
   improved by a photobioreactor design which is kinetically adapted to the
   rate-limiting steps in cell physiology. However, taking into account the
   real photon demand per assimilated carbon and the energy input for
   biorefinement, it becomes obvious that alternative strategies must be
   developed to reach the goal of a real CO2sequestration.

AB Circadian clocks synchronize various physiological, metabolic and
   developmental processes of organisms with specific phases of recurring
   changes in their environment (e.g. day and night or seasons). Here, we
   investigated whether the circadian clock plays a role in regulation of
   growth and chlorophyll (Chl) accumulation inNannochloropsis gaditana, an
   oleaginous marine microalga which is considered as a potential feedstock
   for biofuels and for which a draft genome sequence has been published.
   Optical density (OD) ofN. gaditanaculture was monitored at 680 and 735
   nm under 12:12 h or 18:6 h light-dark (LD) cycles and after switching to
   continuous illumination in photobioreactors. In parallel, Chl
   fluorescence was measured to assess the quantum yield of photosystem II.
   Furthermore, to test if red- or blue-light photoreceptors are involved
   in clock entrainment inN. gaditana, some of the experiments were
   conducted by using only red or blue light. Growth and Chl accumulation
   were confined to light periods in the LD cycles, increasing more
   strongly in the first half than in the second half of the light periods.
   After switching to continuous light, rhythmic oscillations continued
   (especially for OD680) at least in the first 24 h, with a 50% decrease
   in the capacity to grow and accumulate Chl during the first subjective
   night. Pronounced free-running oscillations were induced by blue light,
   but not by red light. In contrast, the photosystem II quantum yield was
   determined by light conditions. The results indicate interactions
   between circadian and light regulation of growth and Chl accumulation
   inN. gaditana.

AB In recent times, microalgae are perceived as potential feedstocks for
   next generation biofuel production. However, their large scale
   cultivation and associated lipid recovery are confined by a number of
   factors. In this perspective, an endeavor has been made in this work to
   analyze the limiting factors for large scale microalgal cultivation by
   an analytical framework using interpretive structural modeling approach.
   The limiting factors were first identified through a comprehensive
   literature study and then, the interactions among the factors were
   formulated. Subsequently, the key factors that drive the system were
   identified by the multiplication properties of matrices principle. The
   results indicated that various operational and environmental factors
   would influence the mircroalgal culturing technology, the economy of
   fuel production and sustainability of the process. The study also showed
   that there were no autonomous and linkage factors indicating that no
   factors in this study with weak drive and weak dependence powers and all
   the factors considered were stable. Moreover, it was identified that the
   relevant policy mechanism with incentives and other supportive measures
   would benefit the growth of the algal biofuel industry. The present
   study can provide explicit information to support the growth of the
   sustainable biofuel industry.

AB Microalgae anaerobic digestion produces biogas along with a digestate
   that may be reused in agriculture. However, the properties of this
   digestate for agricultural reuse have yet to be determined. The aim of
   this study was to characterise digestates from different microalgae
   anaerobic digestion processes (i.e. digestion of untreated microalgae,
   thermally pretreated microalgae and thermally pretreated microalgae in
   co-digestion with primary sludge). The main parameters evaluated were
   organic matter, macronutrients and heavy metals content, hygenisation,
   potential phytotoxicity and organic matter stabilisation. According to
   the results, all microalgae digestates presented suitable organic matter
   and macronutrients, especially organic and ammonium nitrogen, for
   agricultural soils amendment. However, the thermally pretreated
   microalgae digestate was the least stabilised digestate in comparison
   with untreated microalgae and co-digestion digestates. In vivo bioassays
   demonstrated that the digestates did not show residual phytotoxicity
   when properly diluted, being the co-digestion digestate the one which
   presented less phytotoxicity. Heavy metals contents resulted far below
   the threshold established by the European legislation on sludge
   spreading. Moreover, low presence of E. coli was observed in all
   digestates. Therefore, agricultural reuse of thermally pretreated
   microalgae and primary sludge co-digestate through irrigation emerges a
   suitable strategy to recycle nutrients from wastewater.

AB Microalgae are promising sources of fuels and other chemicals. To
   operate microalgal cultivations efficiently, process control based on
   monitoring of process variables is needed. On-line sensing has important
   advantages over off-line and other analytical and sensing methods in
   minimizing the measurement delay. Consequently, on-line, in-situ sensors
   are preferred. In this respect, optical sensors occupy a central
   position since they are versatile and readily implemented in an on-line
   format. In biotechnological processes, measurements are performed in
   three phases (gaseous, liquid and solid (biomass)), and monitored
   process variables can be classified as physical, chemical and
   biological. On-line sensing technologies that rely on standard
   industrial sensors employed in chemical processes are already
   well-established for monitoring the physical and chemical environment of
   an algal cultivation. In contrast, on-line sensors for the process
   variables of the biological phase, whether biomass, intracellular or
   extracellular products, or the physiological state of living cells, are
   at an earlier developmental stage and are the focus of this review.
   On-line monitoring of biological process variables is much more
   difficult and sometimes impossible and must rely on indirect measurement
   and extensive data processing. In contrast to other recent reviews, this
   review concentrates on current methods and technologies for monitoring
   of biological parameters in microalgal cultivations that are suitable
   for the on-line and in-situ implementation. These parameters include
   cell concentration, chlorophyll content, irradiance, and lipid and
   pigment concentration and are measured using NMR, IR spectrophotometry,
   dielectric scattering, and multispectral methods. An important part of
   the review is the computer-aided monitoring of microalgal cultivations
   in the form of software sensors, the use of multi-parameter measurements
   in mathematical process models, fuzzy logic and artificial neural
   networks. In the future, software sensors will play an increasing role
   in the real-time estimation of biological variables because of their
   flexibility and extendibility.

AB The challenges which the large scale microalgal industry is facing are
   associated with the high cost of key operations such as harvesting,
   nutrient supply and oil extraction. The high-energy input for harvesting
   makes current commercial microalgal biodiesel production economically
   unfeasible and can account for up to 50% of the total cost of biofuel
   production. Co-cultivation of fungal and microalgal cells is getting
   increasing attention because of high efficiency of bio-flocculation of
   microalgal cells with no requirement for added chemicals and low energy
   inputs. Moreover, some fungal and microalgal strains are well known for
   their exceptional ability to purify wastewater, generating biomass that
   represents a renewable and sustainable feedstock for biofuel production.
   We have screened the flocculation efficiency of the filamentous fungus
   A. fumigatus against 11 microalgae representing freshwater, marine,
   small (5 m), large (over 300 m), heterotrophic, photoautotrophic, motile
   and non-motile strains. Some of the strains are commercially used for
   biofuel production. Lipid production and composition were analysed in
   fungal-algal pellets grown on media containing alternative carbon,
   nitrogen and phosphorus sources contained in wheat straw and swine
   wastewater, respectively. Co-cultivation of algae and A. fumigatus cells
   showed additive and synergistic effects on biomass production, lipid
   yield and wastewater bioremediation efficiency. Analysis of fungal-algal
   pellet's fatty acids composition suggested that it can be tailored and
   optimised through co-cultivating different algae and fungi without the
   need for genetic modification.

AB Given that sustainable energy production and advanced wastewater
   treatment for producing clean water are two major challenges faced by
   modern society, microalgae make a desirable treatment alternative by
   providing a renewable biomass feedstock for biofuel production, while
   treating wastewater as a growth medium. Microalgae have been known to be
   resilient to the toxic contaminants of highly concentrated organic
   wastewater (e.g., organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and salinity) and are
   excellent at sorbing heavy metals and emerging contaminants. Economic
   and environmental advantages associated with massive algae culturing in
   wastewater constitute a driving force to promote its utilization as a
   feedstock for biofuels. However, there are still many challenges to be
   resolved which have impeded the development of algal biofuel technology
   at a commercial scale. This review provides an overview of an integrated
   approach using microalgae for wastewater treatment, CO2utilization, and
   biofuel production. The main goal of this article is to promote research
   in algae technologies by outlining critical needs along the integrated
   process train, including cultivation, harvesting, and biofuel
   production. Various aspects associated with design challenges of
   microalgae production are described and current developments in algae
   cultivation and pretreatment of algal biomass for biofuel production are
   also discussed. Furthermore, synergistic coupling of the use of
   microalgae for advanced wastewater treatment and biofuel production is
   highlighted in a sustainability context using life cycle analysis.

AB Rapidly growing industrialization and depletion of non-renewable fossil
   fuel has led to finding alternative viable renewable resources to meet
   the growing energy demand with less carbon dioxide generation. The
   modern world energy strategy is based on cost-effective and green
   alternatives and microalgae cultivation have potential to meet these
   criteria. Microalgae has been identified as a promising and sustainable
   alternative for treating wastewaters along the production of valuable
   products. Microalgae with a short life span, high growth rate and high
   CO2 utilization efficiency is one of viable techniques of renewable
   resources to produce biomass using nutrients in wastewater. At current,
   the technology and cost are the main factors that limit the application
   at industrial scale, which needs an ideal downstream process to minimize
   the production cost. The simultaneous use of microalgae for wastewater
   treatment and biofuel production has made these challenges practicable
   and economically viable. Microalgae efficiency for ammonia, phosphorus
   and heavy metal removal along with biofuel and bio-fertilizer production
   is reviewed. It is also aimed to focus on recent advances in cultivation
   of microalgae in wastewater, the response of microalgae to different
   stresses and their effects on the quality and quantity of high-value
   products was investigated. The prospects for future research dealing
   with wastewater treatment and biofuel production on downstream
   processing is also suggested.

AB Microalgae are capable of producing sustainable bioproducts and biofuels
   by using carbon dioxide or other carbon substances in various
   cultivation modes. It is of great significance to exploit microalgae for
   the economical viability of biofuels and the revenues from high-value
   bioproducts. However, the industrial performance of microalgae is still
   challenged with potential conflict between cost of microalgae
   cultivation and revenues from them, which is mainly ascribed to the lack
   of comprehensive understanding of carbon metabolism and energy
   conversion. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent
   advances in carbon and energy fluxes of light-dependent reaction,
   Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis
   pathway and processes of product biosynthesis in microalgae, with focus
   on the increased photosynthetic and carbon efficiencies. Recent
   strategies for the enhanced production of bioproducts and biofuels from
   microalgae are discussed in detail. Approaches to alter microbial
   physiology by controlling light, nutrient and other environmental
   conditions have the advantages of increasing biomass concentration and
   product yield through the efficient carbon conversion. Engineering
   strategies by regulating carbon partitioning and energy route are
   capable of improving the efficiencies of photosynthesis and carbon
   conversion, which consequently realize high-value biomass. The
   coordination of carbon and energy fluxes is emerging as the potential
   strategy to increase efficiency of carbon fixation and product
   biosynthesis. To achieve more desirable high-value products,
   coordination of multi-stage cultivation with engineering and
   stress-based strategies occupies significant positions in a long term.

AB Biological hydrogen production is being evaluated for use as a fuel,
   since it is a promising substitute for carbonaceous fuels owing to its
   high conversion efficiency and high specific energy content. The basic
   advantages of biological hydrogen production over other "green" energy
   sources are that it does not compete for agricultural land use, and it
   does not pollute, as water is the only by-product of the combustion.
   These characteristics make hydrogen a suitable fuel for the future.
   Among several biotechnological approaches, photobiological hydrogen
   production carried out by green microalgae has been intensively
   investigated in recent years. A select group of photosynthetic organisms
   has evolved the ability to harness light energy to drive hydrogen gas
   production from water. Of these, the microalgaChlamydomonas
   reinhardtiiis considered one of the most promising eukaryotic
   H2producers. In this model microorganism, light energy, H2O and H2are
   linked by two excellent catalysts, the photosystem 2 (PSII) and the
   [FeFe]-hydrogenase, in a pathway usually referred to as direct
   biophotolysis. This review summarizes the main advances made over the
   past decade as an outcome of the discovery of the sulfur-deprivation
   process. Both the scientific and technical barriers that need to be
   overcome before H2photoproduction can be scaled up to an industrial
   level are examined. Actual and theoretical limits of the efficiency of
   the process are also discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on algal
   biohydrogen production outdoors, and guidelines for an optimal
   photobioreactor design are suggested.

U1 11
U2 73
AB Microalgae-based solid biofuels offer a promising option for efficient
   and low-cost utilizations of microalgae. This work investigates the key
   aspects of microalgae-based solid fuels, from production to combustion,
   based on the perspective of microalgae's complete carbon cycle, from
   culture to utilization. Additionally, recent advances in research on the
   physical properties, energy consumption during production, and
   combustion characteristics of microalgae-based solid fuels were
   evaluated. The results show that microalgae is viewed as a promising
   feedstock for the production of solid fuels and constitutes a widely
   followed topic of research. Nowadays, co-pelletization and co-combustion
   of microalgae with other biomass is considered the most competitive way
   to utilize microalgae-based solid fuels. The addition of about 10-30%
   microalgae can reduce the energy consumption of the original pelletizing
   process by about 24-28%, while the density, durability and calorific
   value of the solid fuel can be significantly increased. More
   importantly, thanks to the high lipid content of microalgae, its
   addition can effectively improve the combustion performance of coal,
   sludge and typical biomass fuels, as well as positively influence the
   combustion process. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for
   microalgae-based solid biomass feedstock was discussed, including the
   impact of species diversity on algae-based solid fuels, an exploration
   of further industrial applications, and possible integration pathways
   with the existing microalgae industry chain.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) of microalgae is an intriguing approach for
   bioenergy production. The scaling-up of AD presents a significant
   challenge due to the systematic efficiency losses related to process
   instabilities. To gain a comprehensive understanding of AD behavior,
   this study assessed a modified version of the anaerobic digestion model
   No1 (ADM1) + Contois kinetics to represent microalgae AD impacted by
   overloading. To this end, two new inhibition functions were implemented:
   inhibition by acetate for acidogenesis/acetogenesis and total volatile
   fatty acids for hydrolysis. This proposed ADM1 modification (including
   Contois kinetics) simulated AD behavior during the stable, disturbed and
   recovery periods, showing that the inhibition functions described in the
   original ADM1 cannot explain the AD performance under one of the most
   common perturbations at industrial scale (overloading). The findings
   underscore the importance of refining the inhibitions present in
   original ADM1 to better capture and predict the complexities of
   microalgae AD against overloading.

AB Microalgae have been shown to be a source of multiple bio-based products
   ranging from high value molecules to commodities. Along with their
   potential to produce a large variety of products, microalgae can also be
   used for the depollution of wastewaters of different origins (urban,
   industrial, and agricultural). This paper is focused on the importance
   of harnessing the bioremediation capacity of microalgae to treat
   wastewaters in order to develop the microalgae industry (especially the
   microalgae biofuel industry) and to find other alternatives to the
   classic wastewater treatment processes. The current research on the
   potential of microalgae to treat a specific wastewater or a targeted
   pollutant is reviewed and discussed. Then, both strategies of selecting
   the best microalgae strain to treat a specific wastewater or pollutant
   and using a natural or an artificial consortium to perform the treatment
   will be detailed. The process options for treating wastewaters using
   microalgae will be discussed up to the final valorization of the
   biomass. The last part is dedicated to the challenges which research
   need to address in order to develop the potential of microalgae to treat
   wastewaters.

AB The growing demand of microalgal biomass for biofuels, nutraceuticals,
   cosmetics, animal feed, and other bioproducts has created a strong
   interest in developing low-cost sustainable cultivation media and
   methods. Agricultural and food residues represent low-cost abundant and
   renewable sources of organic carbon that can be valorized for the
   cultivation of microalgae, while converting them from an environmental
   liability to an industrial asset. Biochemical treatment of such residues
   results in the release of various sugars, primarily glucose, sucrose,
   fructose, arabinose, and xylose along with other nutrients, such as
   trace elements. These sugars and nutrients can be metabolized in the
   absence of light (heterotrophic) or the presence of light (mixotrophic)
   by a variety of microalgae species for biomass and bioproduct
   production. The present review provides an up-to-date critical
   assessment of the prospects of various types of agricultural and food
   residues to serve as algae feedstocks and the microalgae species that
   can be grown on such residues under a range of cultivation conditions.
   Utilization of these feedstocks can create potential industrial
   applications for sustainable production of microalgal biomass and
   bioproducts.

AB Heavy metals are non-degradable pollutants. Heavy metals accumulation in
   the environment increases along with the massive industrial activity and
   the growth of the human population. These pollutants are hazardous to
   various kinds of living things. The accumulation of heavy metals in the
   environment triggers bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Heavy metal
   exposure causes some health problems in humans. The conventional methods
   of heavy metals adsorption are less effective, expensive, and cause
   other problems. Phycoremediation using microalgae is a promising
   alternative method for absorbing heavy metals. Microalgal cells consist
   of various components such as lipids, polysaccharides, and proteins.
   Those compounds contain negative charges that will interact with
   positive charges on heavy metals. The bond between these different
   charges leads to the adsorption of heavy metals in the environment to
   the surface of microalgal cells. In this review, the authors discussed
   the potential use of microalgae to adsorb heavy metals polluting the
   environment. Phycoremediation is cheaper, easier, and safer for the
   environment. Besides, the microalgal biomass can be utilized in biofuel
   production.

AB Background: Decreasing fossil fuels and its impact on global warming
   have led to an increasing demand for its replacement by sustainable
   renewable biofuels. Microalgae may offer a potential feedstock for
   renewable biofuels capable of converting atmospheric CO2to substantial
   biomass and valuable biofuels, which is of great importance for the food
   and energy industries.Parachlorella kessleri, a marine unicellular green
   alga belonging to class Trebouxiophyceae, accumulates large amount of
   lipids under nutrient-deprived conditions. The present study aims to
   understand the metabolic imprints in order to elucidate the
   physiological mechanisms of lipid accumulations in this microalga under
   nutrient deprivation. Results: Molecular profiles were obtained using
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) ofP. kesslerisubjected to
   nutrient deprivation. Relative quantities of more than 60 metabolites
   were systematically compared in all the three starvation conditions. Our
   results demonstrate that in lipid metabolism, the quantities of neutral
   lipids increased significantly followed by the decrease in other
   metabolites involved in photosynthesis, and nitrogen assimilation.
   Nitrogen starvation seems to trigger the triacylglycerol (TAG)
   accumulation rapidly, while the microalga seems to tolerate phosphorous
   limitation, hence increasing both biomass and lipid content. The
   metabolomic and lipidomic profiles have identified a few common
   metabolites such as citric acid and 2-ketoglutaric acid which play
   significant role in diverting flux towards acetyl-CoA leading to
   accumulation of neutral lipids, whereas other molecules such as
   trehalose involve in cell growth regulation, when subjected to nutrient
   deprivation. Conclusions: Understanding the entire system through
   qualitative (untargeted) metabolome approach inP. kesslerihas led to
   identification of relevant metabolites involved in the biosynthesis and
   degradation of precursor molecules that may have potential for biofuel
   production, aiming towards the vision of tomorrow's bioenergy needs.

AB To reduce dependence on fossil fuels and curb greenhouse effect,
   cyanobacteria have emerged as an important chassis candidate for
   producing biofuels and chemicals due to their capability to directly
   utilize sunlight and CO2 as the sole energy and carbon sources,
   respectively. Recent progresses in developing and applying various
   synthetic biology tools have led to the successful constructions of
   novel pathways of several dozen green fuels and chemicals utilizing
   cyanobacterial chassis. Meanwhile, it is increasingly recognized that in
   order to enhance productivity of the synthetic cyanobacterial systems,
   optimizing and engineering more robust and high-efficient cyanobacterial
   chassis should not be omitted. In recent years, numerous research
   studies have been conducted to enhance production of green fuels and
   chemicals through cyanobacterial chassis modifications involving
   photosynthesis, CO2 uptake and fixation, products exporting, tolerance,
   and cellular regulation. In this article, we critically reviewed recent
   progresses and universal strategies in cyanobacterial chassis
   engineering to make it more robust and effective for bio-chemicals
   production.

TI Machine learning methods modeling carbohydrate-enriched cyanobacteria
   biomass production in wastewater treatment systems.
SO Energies
VL 15

PY 2022
U1 4
U2 57
AB One-stage production of carbohydrate-enriched microalgae biomass in
   wastewater is a promising option to obtain biofuels. Understanding the
   interaction of water quality parameters such as nutrients, carbon,
   internal carbohydrates, and microbial composition in the culture is
   crucial for efficient operation and viable large-scale cultivation.
   Bioprocess models are an essential tool for studying the simultaneous
   effect of complex factors on carbohydrate accumulation, optimizing the
   process, and reducing operational costs. In this sense, we use a dataset
   obtained from an empirical model that analyzed the accumulation of
   carbohydrates in a single process (simultaneous growth and accumulation)
   from real wastewater. In this experiment, there were no ideal conditions
   (limiting nutrient conditions), but rather these limitations are
   guaranteed by the operating conditions (hydraulic retention
   times/nutrient or carbon loads). Thus, the model integrates 18 variables
   that are affected and not only carbohydrates. The effect of these
   variables directly influences the accumulation of carbohydrates.
   Therefore, this paper analyzes artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms
   to develop a model to forecast biomass production in wastewater
   treatment systems. Carbohydrates were modeled using five artificial
   intelligence methods: (1) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), (2)
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), (3) Long Short-Term Memory Network
   (LSTMs), (4) K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and (5) Random Forest (RF). The
   AI methods allow learning how several components interact and if their
   combinations work faster than building the physical experiments over the
   same period of time. After comparing the five learning models, the
   CNN-1D model obtained the best results with an MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   = 0.0028. This result shows that the model adequately approximates the
   system's dynamics.

AB Bacteria and yeast are being intensively used to produce biofuels and
   high-added-value products by using plant biomass derivatives as
   substrates. The number of microorganisms available for industrial
   processes is increasing thanks to biotechnological improvements to
   enhance their productivity and yield through microbial metabolic
   engineering and laboratory evolution. This is allowing the traditional
   industrial processes for biofuel production, which included multiple
   steps, to be improved through the consolidation of single-step
   processes, reducing the time of the global process, and increasing the
   yield and operational conditions in terms of the desired products.
   Engineered microorganisms are now capable of using feedstocks that they
   were unable to process before their modification, opening broader
   possibilities for establishing new markets in places where biomass is
   available. This review discusses metabolic engineering approaches that
   have been used to improve the microbial processing of biomass to convert
   the plant feedstock into fuels. Metabolically engineered microorganisms
   (MEMs) such as bacteria, yeasts, and microalgae are described,
   highlighting their performance and the biotechnological tools that were
   used to modify them. Finally, some examples of patents related to the
   MEMs are mentioned in order to contextualize their current industrial
   use.

AB Microalgae cultivation is a promising technology for integrated effluent
   polishing and biofuel production, but poor separability of microalgal
   cells hinders its industrial application. This study intended to
   selectively enrich settleable microalgal consortia in mixed culture by
   applying "wash-out" pressure, which was realized by controlling settling
   time (ST) and volume exchange ratio (VER) in photo-SBRs. The results
   demonstrated that highly settleable microalgal consortia (settling
   efficiency >97%; SVI=17-50 mL/g) could be enriched from indigenous algal
   cultures developed in WWTP's effluent. High VER was the key factor for
   the fast development of settleable microalgae. VER was also a
   controlling factor of the algal community structure. High VERs (0.5 and
   0.7) resulted in the dominance of diatom, while low VER (0.2)
   facilitated the dominance of cyanobacteria. The settleable microalgal
   consortia were very efficient in phosphorus removal (effluent
   PO43--P<0.1 mg/L; removal efficiency >99%), which was largely attributed
   to intensive chemical precipitation of phosphate induced by high pH
   (8.5-10). However, the high pH decreased the bioavailable inorganic
   carbon, resulting in incomplete nitrate removal (effluent NO3--N=2.2-4
   mg/L; removal efficiency=61-79%) under high VERs and low lipid content
   (up to 10%) in the settleable microalgae. This problem could be resolved
   by sparging CO2 or controlling pH. Overall, this study demonstrated a
   simple and effective method to overcome the separation challenge in
   scale-up of microalgae biotechnology for advanced wastewater
   purification and biofuel production.

AB Today, hydrogen is one of the best options for generating electrical
   energy, for both industrial and residential use. The greatest volume of
   hydrogen produced today derives from processes that utilize petroleum.
   Although hydrogen has numerous benefits, continuing to produce it by
   these means is undesirable. This document presents a review of the
   literature on biohydrogen production based on an analysis of over 15
   types of terrestrial and marine biomasses. The fundamental components of
   different production systems are described, with a focus on the
   thermochemical processes of pyrolysis and gasification, which have been
   identified as two of the most effective, practical ways to produce
   hydrogen from biomass. It also discusses catalysts, solid residues, and
   residual water that are used in the thermochemical production of
   biohydrogen. The article ends with an analysis of hydrogen and its
   benefits as an energy option with great potential in the short term to
   participate in the transition from fossil fuels.

AB With increasing concerns about the global crude oil consumption,
   sustainable alternative fuels from renewable resources are gaining more
   and more attention. In the recent push of phycological research,
   microalgae have emerged as one of the most sustainable lipid-based
   biofuel feedstocks. However, their intrinsic genetic potential is
   usually not sufficient to enable significantly high biofuel
   productivity. In this regard, understanding the genes and metabolic
   pathways through omics studies leading to improved bio-product yield is
   crucial. Integrative omics analysis is a powerful biotechnology-based
   approach allowing abundant access to varied metabolic pathways and has
   facilitated understanding of the complete system of microalgae. These
   techniques assist us to acquire a large volume of data from a single
   experiment. There are several reports on the significant use of various
   omics techniques to upgrade the strains of microalgae for improving the
   microalgal biofuel production. Omics approaches that have helped in the
   enhancement of the cellular lipid content, are highlighted in this
   article. This review summarizes the current knowledge about omics
   studies of microalgae intending to increase the production of biofuel.

AB Microalgae is an important source of raw materials for the production of
   biofuels and other fine substances that can contribute to the current
   need for sustainable renewable energies. Environmental and climatic
   conditions directly affect the production of biomass from microalgae
   crops and, in general, the conditions of the department of Valle del
   Cauca, Colombia, are optimal given the levels of solar radiation and its
   intensity all the year due to its geographical location. Considering the
   potential of microalgae in biofactory, this article presents a review of
   the factors involved in the development of microalgae crops; and the
   technology necessary for its exploitation. Also analyzes the viability
   of closed photobioreactors due to its high mass transfer, greater use of
   solar-based and reduction of pollution by foreign microorganisms, which
   is fundamental in the production of biomass. This information is useful
   for the application of engineering and the future development of
   efficient and commercially viable technology for the production of
   biofuels from microalgae.

AB Although ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), with two large subunits
   (ls) and two small subunits (ss), is a promising knockout target for
   increasing the neutral lipid content, the details regarding the
   sequence-structure features and their distribution within metabolic
   system in microalgae is rather limited. Against this backdrop, a
   comprehensive genome-wide comparative analysis on 14 sequenced
   microalgal genomes was performed. For the first time the
   heterotetrameric structure of the enzyme and the interaction of the
   catalytic unit with the substrate was also studied. Novel findings of
   the present study includes: (i) at the DNA level, the genes controlling
   thessare more conserved than those controlling thels; the variation in
   both the gene groups is mainly due to exon number, exon length and exon
   phase distribution; (ii) at protein level, thessgenes are more conserved
   relative to those forls; (III) three putative key consensus sequences
   'LGGGAGTRLYPLTKNRAKPAV', 'WFQGTADAV' and 'ASMGIYVFRKD' were ubiquitously
   conserved in all the AGPases; (iv) molecular dynamics investigations
   revealed that the modeled AGPase heterotetrameric structure, from
   oleaginous algaeChlamydomonas reinharditii, was completely stable in
   real time environment; (v) The binding interfaces of catalytic
   unit,ssAGPase, fromC. reinharditiiwith alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate
   (alphaGP) was also analyzed. The results of the present study have
   provided system-based insights into the structure-function of the genes
   and encoded proteins, which provided clues for exploitation of
   variability in these genes that, could be further utilized to design
   site-specific mutagenic experiments for engineering of microalgal
   strains towards sustainable development of biofuel.

U1 6
U2 47
AB An emerging idea is to couple wastewater treatment and biofuel
   production using microalgae to achieve higher productivities and lower
   costs. This paper proposes a metabolic modeling ofChlorellasp. growing
   on fermentation wastes (blend of acetate, butyrate and other acids) in
   mixotrophic conditions, accounting also for the possible inhibitory
   substrates. This model extends previous works by modifying the metabolic
   network to include the consumption of glycerol and glucose
   byChlorellasp., with the goal to test the addition of these substrates
   in order to overcome butyrate inhibition. The metabolic model was built
   using the DRUM framework and consists of 188 reactions and 173
   metabolites. After a calibration phase, the model was successfully
   challenged with data from 122 experiments collected from scientific
   literature in autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. The
   optimal feeding strategy estimated with the model reduces the time to
   consume the volatile fatty acids from 16 days to 2 days. The high
   prediction capability of this model opens new routes for enhancing
   design and operation in waste valorization using microalgae.

   in a medium containing 0.025-0.200 g L-1urea were 0.464-2.027 g L-1and

   g d-1L-1occurred in a medium containing 0.100 g L-1urea. In the
   fed-batch cultivation, the highest lipid content was obtained by feeding
   0.025 g L-1of urea during the stationary phase, but the lipid
   productivity was not significantly increased. However, a semi-continuous
   process was carried out by harvesting the culture and renewing urea at
   0.025 g L-1each time when the cultivation achieved the early stationary
   phase. The maximum lipid productivity of 0.139 g d-1L-1in the

AB Microalgae offer a promising source of biofuel and a wide array of
   high-value biomolecules. Large-scale cultivation of microalgae at low
   density poses a significant challenge in terms of water management.
   High-density microalgae cultivation, however, can be challenging due to
   biochemical changes associated with growth dynamics. Therefore, there is
   a need for a biomarker that can predict the optimum density for high
   biomass cultivation. A locally isolated microalgaCyanobacterium
   aponinumCCC734 was grown with optimized nitrogen and phosphorus in the
   ratio of 12:1 for sustained high biomass productivity. To understand
   density-associated bottlenecks secretome dynamics were monitored at
   biomass densities from 0.6  0.1 to 7  0.1 g/L (2 to 22 OD) in batch
   mode. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry identified
   880 exometabolites in the supernatant ofC. aponinumCCC734. The PCA
   analysis showed similarity between exometabolite profiles at low (4 and
   8 OD) and mid (12 and 16 OD), whereas distinctly separate at high
   biomass concentrations (20 and 22 OD). Ten exometabolites were selected
   based on their role in influencing growth and are specifically present
   at low, mid, and high biomass concentrations. Taking cues from secretome
   dynamics, 5.0  0.5 g/L biomass concentration (16 OD) was optimal forC.
   aponinumCCC734 cultivation. Further validation was performed with a
   semi-turbidostat mode of cultivation for 29 days with a volumetric
   productivity of 1.0  0.2 g/L/day. The secretomes-based footprinting tool
   is the first comprehensive growth study of exometabolite at the
   molecular level at variable biomass densities. This tool may be utilized
   in analyzing and directing microalgal cultivation strategies and
   reduction in overall operating costs.

AB The rising global demand for energy and the decreasing stocks of fossil
   fuels, combined with environmental problems associated with greenhouse
   gas emissions, are driving research and development for alternative and
   renewable sources of energy. Algae have been gaining increasing
   attention as a potential source of bio-renewable energy because they
   grow rapidly, and farming them does not, generally, compete for
   agricultural land use. Previous studies of algal biofuels have focused
   on microalgae because of their fast growth rate and high lipid content.
   Here we analyze the multiple merits of biofuel production using
   macroalgae, with particular reference to their chemical composition,
   biomass and biofuel productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Compared to
   microalgae, macroalgae have lower growth rates and energy productivity
   but higher cost-effectiveness. A bio-mass productivity of over 73.5 t
   dry mass ha-1 year-1 with a methane yield of 285 m3 t-1 dry mass would
   make electricity production from macroalgae profitable, and this might
   be achieved using fast-growing macroalgae, such as Ulva. Taking into
   account the remediation of eutrophication and CO2, exploring macroalgae
   for a renewable bioenergy is of importance and feasible.

AB This article discusses the possibility of using microalgae in livestock
   production, with special reference to reducing harmful and noxious gas
   pollutant emission. Taking into consideration ongoing climate crisis the
   issue linked with reduction of gases from intensive animal production is
   a key important. Research shows that photosynthesizing properties of
   algae can be utilized for CO2sequestration. Microalgae may be used as a
   method to reduces emissions of harmful gaseous components from natural
   fertilizers while enriching microalgae in N and P from manure or slurry.
   It is also worth noting that studies' results show microalgae biomass
   may be used as a substrate for biofuel production and as a feed additive
   partly replacing cereals in animal diets. The possiblity of applying
   microalgae as a feed additive was confirmed in studies, where microalgal
   powder (MAP) was used in layer feeding. MAP - supplementation causes
   improvements in egg quality. Microalgae may be used as an alternative to
   fish oil in cows' diets, causing increase in content of cis-9, trans-11
   CLA in milk. Another important use of the unicellular algal biomass in
   agriculture is biogas production. The aim of this article is to review
   and systematize the current state of knowledge on topic of the
   application microalgae in animal production.

AB In recent years, the production of plastic has been estimated to reach
   300 million tonnes, and nearly the same amount has been dumped into the
   waters. This waste material causes long-term damage to the ecosystem,
   economic sectors, and aquatic environments. Fragmentation of plastics to
   microplastics has been detected in the world's oceans, which causes a
   serious global impact. It is found that most of this debris ends up in
   water environments. Hence, this research aims to review the microbial
   degradation of microplastic, especially in water bodies and coastal
   areas. Aerobic bacteria will oxidize and decompose the microplastic from
   this environment to produce nutrients. Furthermore, plants such as
   microalgae can employ this nutrient as an energy source, which is the
   byproduct of microplastic. This paper highlights the reduction of
   plastics in the environment, typically by ultraviolet reduction,
   mechanical abrasion processes, and utilization by microorganisms and
   microalgae. Further discussion on the utilization of microplastics in
   the current technologies comprised of mechanical, chemical, and
   biological methods focusing more on the microalgae and microbial
   pathways via fuel cells has been elaborated. It can be denoted in the
   fuel cell system, the microalgae are placed in the bio-cathode section,
   and the anode chamber consists of the colony of microorganisms. Hence,
   electric current from the fuel cell can be generated to produce clean
   energy. Thus, the investigation on the emerging technologies via fuel
   cell systems and the potential use of microplastic pollutants for
   consumption has been discussed in the paper. The biochemical changes of
   microplastic and the interaction of microalgae and bacteria towards the
   degradation pathways of microplastic are also being observed in this
   review.

AB In recent decades, microalgae have emerged as new sustainable resources
   for the production of various bioactive and biochemical compounds. These
   organisms are photosynthetic, use CO2 as their sole carbon source, and
   grow rapidly under different environmental conditions. This makes
   microalgae a promising source of feedstock for many bio-commodities.
   However, the economic viability for large-scale production through
   microalgal cells is limited to certain organisms. Recent advances in
   omics technologies, along with high-throughput approaches, have provided
   new insights for understanding microalgal metabolites. With the
   improvement in metabolomic technology, sensitivity for the detection of
   cellular metabolites has increased, and it has directly enhanced our
   understanding of cellular metabolism and the corresponding metabolic
   pathways. Moreover, these metabolic techniques, along with other omics
   technologies, help us to characterize the changes in the cellular
   functioning of the different cells under environmental conditions.
   Metabolomic research on microalgae explores new metabolites and the
   understanding of their biosynthesis at the metabolic level. In this
   review, we discuss how these metabolomics techniques are applied to
   microalgae to study their metabolic networks. Additionally, we also
   discuss how integrating other tools of systems biology can improve the
   productivity of microalgal cells, especially for industrially important
   commodities.

AB In recent years, coupling bacterial dark fermentation (DF) and
   heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae (HCM) has been pointed out as a
   promising sustainable approach for producing both gaseous and liquid
   biofuels. Complex organic waste and effluents that are not susceptible
   to be directly degraded by microalgae are first converted into volatile
   fatty acids (VFAs) and hydrogen by DF. In this work, the feasibility of
   using DF effluents to sustain HCM has been thoroughly reviewed and
   evaluated. Promising perspectives in terms of microalgae biomass and
   lipids production are proposed and can be extended as guidelines to
   promote HCM whatever the organic waste used. Abiotic and biotic factors
   from DF effluents that promote or inhibit microalgae growth are
   discussed as well as the use of unsterile DF effluents. Overall, the
   microalgae growth is favored on effluents containing high acetate
   concentration (>3 g L-1), with a high acetate:butyrate ratio (>2.5), and
   when pH is strictly controlled. At a low acetate:butyrate ratio (<1)
   and/or high total metabolites concentrations (>10 g L-1), a low
   substrate:microalgae ratio and the presence of light appear to enhance
   microalgae growth. Butyrate content appears to be a key factor when
   coupling DF/HCM since high butyrate concentration inhibits the
   microalgae growth.

AB Background: In the wake of rising energy demands, microalgae have
   emerged as potential sources of sustainable and renewable carbon-neutral
   fuels, such as bio-hydrogen and bio-oil. Purpose: For rational metabolic
   engineering, the elucidation of metabolic pathways in fine detail and
   their manipulation according to requirements is the key to exploiting
   the use of microalgae. Emergence of site-specific nucleases have
   revolutionized applied research leading to biotechnological gains.
   Genome engineering as well as modulation of the endogenous genome with
   high precision using CRISPR systems is being gradually employed in
   microalgal research. Further, to optimize and produce better algal
   platforms, use of systems biology network analysis and integration of
   omics data is required. This review discusses two important approaches:
   systems biology and gene editing strategies used on microalgal systems
   with a focus on biofuel production and sustainable solutions. It also
   emphasizes that the integration of such systems would contribute and
   compliment applied research on microalgae. Conclusions: Recent advances
   in microalgae are discussed, including systems biology, gene editing
   approaches in lipid bio-synthesis, and antenna engineering. Lastly, it
   has been attempted here to showcase how CRISPR/Cas systems are a better
   editing tool than existing techniques that can be utilized for gene
   modulation and engineering during biofuel production.

AB Background: Carbohydrates are major biomass source in fuel-targeted
   biorefinery.Arthrospira platensisis the largest commercialized
   microalgae with good environmental tolerance and high biomass
   production. However, the traditional target ofA. platensiscultivation is
   the protein, which is the downstream product of carbohydrates. Aiming to
   provide the alternative non-food carbohydrates source, the feasible
   manipulation technology on the cultivation is needed, as well as new
   separation methodology to achieve maximum utilization of overall
   biomass. Results: The present study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility
   of industrially producing carbohydrate-enrichedA. platensisand
   characterize the structure of the polysaccharide involved. Cultivated in
   industrial-scale outdoor open raceway ponds under nitrogen limitation,A.
   platensisaccumulated maximally 64.3%DW of carbohydrate. The maximum
   biomass and carbohydrate productivity reached 27.5 g m-2day-1and 26.2 g
   m-2day-1, respectively. The efficient extraction and purification of the
   polysaccharides include a high-pressure homogenization-assisted hot
   water extraction followed by flocculation with a non-toxic flocculant
   ZTC1 + 1, with the polysaccharide purity and total recovery reaching 81%
   and 75%, respectively. The purified polysaccharide was mainly composed
   of (1  3)(1  4)- or (1  3)(1  2)-alpha-glucan with a molecular weight of
   300-700 kDa, which differed from the commonly acknowledged glycogen.
   Conclusions: By the way of controlled nitrogen limitation, the high
   carbohydrate production ofA. platensisin the industrial scale was
   achieved. The alpha-glucan fromA. platensiscould be a potential glucose
   source for industrial applications. A non-toxic separation method of
   carbohydrate was applied to maintain the possibility of utilization of
   residue in high-value field.

AB Microalgae are a potential source of sustainable biomass feedstock for
   biofuel generation, and can proliferate under versatile environmental
   conditions. Mass cultivation of microalgae is the most overpriced and
   technically challenging step in microalgal biofuel generation.
   Wastewater is an available source of the water plus nutrients necessary
   for algae cultivation. Microalgae provide a cost-effective and
   sustainable means of advanced (waste)water treatment with the
   simultaneous production of commercially valuable products. Microalgae
   show higher efficiency in nutrient removal than other microorganisms
   because the nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, urea and trace
   elements) present in various wastewaters are essential for microalgal
   growth. Potential progress in the area of microalgal cultivation coupled
   with wastewater treatment in open and closed systems has led to an
   improvement in algal biomass production. However, significant efforts
   are still required for the development and optimization of a coupled
   system to simultaneously generate biomass and treat wastewater. In this
   review, the systematic description of the technologies required for the
   successful integration of wastewater treatment and cultivation of
   microalgae for biomass production toward biofuel generation was
   discussed. It deeply reviews the microalgae-mediated treatment of
   different wastewaters (including municipal, piggery/swine, industrial,
   and anaerobic wastewater), and highlight the wastewater characteristics
   suitable for microalgae cultivation. Various pretreatment methods (such
   as filtration, autoclaving, UV application, and dilution) needed for
   wastewater prior to its use for microalgae cultivation have been
   discussed. The selection of potential microalgae species that can grow
   in wastewater and generate a large amount of biomass has been
   considered. Discussion on microalgal cultivation systems (including
   raceways, photobioreactors, turf scrubbers, and hybrid systems) that use
   wastewater, evaluating the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational
   expenditures (OPEX) of each system was reported. In view of the
   limitations of recent studies, the future directions for integrated
   wastewater treatment and microalgae biomass production for industrial
   applications were suggested.

AB In this review, a simple procedure that portends the open-pond growth of
   commercially viable diatoms is discussed. We examined a number of topics
   relevant to the production and harvesting of diatoms as well as topics
   concerning the production of bioproducts from diatoms. Among the former
   topics, we show that it is currently possible to continuously grow
   diatoms and control the presence of invasive species without chemical
   toxins at an average annual yield of 132 MT dry diatoms ha-1over a
   period of almost 5 years, while maintaining the dominancy of the optimal
   diatom species on a seasonal basis. The dominant species varies during
   the year. The production of microalgae is essentially agriculture, but
   without the ability to control invasive species in the absence of
   herbicides and insecticides, pollution and production costs would be
   prohibitive. Among the latter topics are the discussions of whether it
   is better to produce lipids and then convert them to biofuels or
   maximize the production of diatom biomass and then convert it to
   biocrude products using, for example, hydrothermal processes. It is
   becoming increasingly evident that without massive public support, the
   commercial production of microalgal biofuels alone will remain elusive.
   While economically competitive production of biofuels from diatoms will
   be difficult, when priority is given to multiple high-value products,
   including wastewater treatment, and when biofuels are considered
   co-products in a systems approach to commercial production of diatoms,
   an economically competitive process will become more likely.

AB Background: Phosphorus (P) is an essential element of microalgae, which
   is either required for anabolism or for energy metabolism. When
   employing a nitrogen limitation strategy to trigger microalgal
   intracellular lipid accumulation, P supplementation was always
   simultaneously applied to compensate for the accompanied growth
   inhibition. Results: This study identified that P exerts hormesis
   effects on microalgae. Slight excess of P (≤45 mg L-1) under nitrogen
   limitation condition stimulated the cell growth ofChlorella regularisand
   achieved a 10.2% biomass production increase. This also improved
   mitochondrial activity by 25.0% compared to control (P=5.4 mg L-1). The
   lipid productivity reached 354.38 mg (L d)-1, which increased by 39.3%
   compared to control. Such an improvement was caused by the
   intracellularly stored polyphosphate energy pool. However, large excess
   of P (250 mg L-1) inhibited the cell growth by 38.8% and mitochondrial
   activity decreased by 71.3%.C. regulariscells showed obvious poisoning
   status, such as enlarged size, plasmolysis, deformation of cell walls,
   and disorganization of organelles. This is probably because the
   over-accumulated P protonated the amide-N and disrupted membrane
   permeability. Conclusions: These results provide new insight into the
   roles of P in microalgae lipid production: P does not always play a
   positive role under nitrogen limitation conditions.

AB It was generally believed that coal sources are not favorable as live-in
   habitats for microorganisms due to their recalcitrant chemical nature
   and negligible decomposition. However, accumulating evidence has
   revealed the presence of diverse microbial groups in coal environments
   and their significant metabolic role in coal biogeochemical dynamics and
   ecosystem functioning. The high oxygen content, organic fractions, and
   lignin-like structures of lower-rank coals may provide effective means
   for microbial attack, still representing a greatly unexplored frontier
   in microbiology. Coal degradation/conversion technology by native
   bacterial and fungal species has great potential in agricultural
   development, chemical industry production, and environmental
   rehabilitation. Furthermore, native microalgal species can offer a
   sustainable energy source and an excellent bioremediation strategy
   applicable to coal spill/seam waters. Additionally, the measures of the
   fate of the microbial community would serve as an indicator of
   restoration progress on post-coal-mining sites. This review puts forward
   a comprehensive vision of coal biodegradation and bioprocessing by
   microorganisms native to coal environments for determining their
   biotechnological potential and possible applications.

AB Microalgae enhance the removal of nutrients, organic contaminants, heavy
   metals, and pathogens from domestic wastewater and furnish an
   interesting raw material for the production of high-value chemicals
   (algae metabolites) or biogas. Photosynthetic oxygen production also
   reduces the need for external aeration, which is especially advantageous
   for the treatment of hazardous pollutants that must be biodegraded
   aerobically but might volatilize during mechanical aeration. Recent
   studies have therefore shown that when proper methods for algal
   selection and cultivation are used, it is possible to use microalgae to
   produce the O2 required by acclimatized bacteria to biodegrade hazardous
   pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolics, and
   organic solvents. Well-mixed photobioreactors with algal biomass
   recirculation are recommended to protect the microalgae from effluent
   toxicity and optimize light utilization efficiency. The optimum biomass
   concentration to maintain in the system depends mainly on the light
   intensity and the reactor configuration: At low light intensity, the
   biomass concentration should be optimized to avoid mutual shading and
   dark respiration whereas at high light intensity, a high biomass
   concentration can be useful to protect microalgae from light inhibition
   and optimize the light/dark cycle frequency. Photobioreactors can be
   designed as open (stabilization ponds or high rate algal ponds) or
   enclosed (tubular, flat plate) systems. The latter are generally costly
   to construct and operate but more efficient than open systems. The best
   configuration to select will depend on factors such as process safety,
   land cost, and biomass use. Biomass harvest remains a limitation but
   recent progresses have been made in the selection of flocculating
   strains, the application of bioflocculants, or the use of immobilized
   biomass systems.

AB Aquatic algal communities demonstrated their appeal for diverse
   industrial applications due to their vast availability, ease of harvest,
   lower production costs, and ability to biosynthesize valuable molecules.
   Algal biomass is promising because it can multiply in water and on land.
   Integrated algal systems have a significant advantage in wastewater
   treatment due to their ability to use phosphorus and nitrogen,
   simultaneously accumulating heavy metals and toxic substances. Several
   species of microalgae have adapted to thrive in these harsh
   environmental circumstances. The potential of algal communities
   contributes to achieving the United Nations' sustainable development
   goals in improving aquaculture, combating climate change, reducing
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and providing biomass as a biofuel
   feedstock. Algal-based biomass processing technology facilitates the
   development of a circular bio-economy that is both commercially and
   ecologically viable. An integrated bio-refinery process featuring zero
   waste discharge could be a sustainable solution. In the current review,
   we will highlight wastewater management by algal species. In addition,
   designing and optimizing algal bioreactors for wastewater treatment have
   also been incorporated.

AB Microalgae-based biodiesel production has many advantages over crude oil
   extraction and refinement, thus attracting more and more concern.
   Protein ubiquitination is a crucial mechanism in eukaryotes to regulate
   physiological responses and cell development, which is highly related to
   algal biodiesel production. Cullins as the molecular base of cullin-RING
   E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which are the largest known class of
   ubiquitin ligases, control the life activities of eukaryotic cells.
   Here, three cullins (CrCULs) in the green microalgae Chlamydomonas
   reinhardtii were identified and characterized. To investigate the roles
   of CrCULs in lipid metabolism, the gene expression profiles of CrCULs
   under nutrition starvation were examined. Except for down-regulation
   under nitrogen starvation, the CrCUL3 gene was induced by sulfur and
   iron starvation. CrCUL2 seemed insensitive to nitrogen and sulfur
   starvation because it only had changes after treatment for eight days.
   CrCUL4 exhibited an expression peak after nitrogen starvation for two
   days but this declined with time. All CrCULs expressions significantly
   increased under iron deficiency at two and four days but decreased
   thereafter. The silencing of CrCUL2 and CrCUL4 expression using RNAi
   (RNA interference) resulted in biomass decline and lipids increase but
   an increase of 20% and 28% in lipid content after growth for 10 days,
   respectively. In CrCUL2 and CrCUL4 RNAi lines, the content of fatty
   acids, especially C16:0 and C18:0, notably increased as well. However,
   the lipid content and fatty acids of the CrCUL3 RNAi strain slightly
   changed. Moreover, the subcellular localization of CrCUL4 showed a
   nuclear distribution pattern. These results suggest CrCUL2 and CrCUL4
   are regulators for lipid accumulation in C. reinhardtii. This study may
   offer an important complement of lipid biosynthesis in microalgae.

AB Microalgae have been appeared as excellent source of bioenergy recently
   in Brunei Darussalam due to the favorable growth conditions, while
   sewage sludge emerged as major threat to the environment. Therefore, the
   challenge of sewage sludge management and microalgae utilization has
   spurred the demand of developing an innovative approach to utilize these
   sources for commercial applications. Hence, the main objective of this
   study was to characterize the bioenergy properties of microalgae, sewage
   sludge, and different blending ratios of microalgae-sewage sludge
   incorporated with sub-bituminous coal. Among three different blended
   samples, sample mixture 1 (SM-1) combined with 25% microalgae, 25%
   sewage sludge, and 50% coal presented the highest calorific value of
   16.57 MJ/kg and lowest ash content of 45.61%. Along with this, SM-1 also
   manifested the highest values for pellet density (1.23 g/cm3) and energy
   density (20.41 GJ/m3) that can be referred as the most favorable values
   among all co-pelletized samples for transportation and logistics.
   Besides the characterization of raw samples, this study also emphasized
   on elemental analysis of ash content to determine the possibility of
   fouling and slugging. Ash analysis of all blends represented the major
   inorganic components aluminum (Al) and silicon (Si). Thermogravimetric
   analysis of all samples demonstrated the different phases of pyrolysis
   and combustion within 50 to 900°C at heating rate of 10°C/min. It can be
   concluded that this study recommended SM-1 as a potential feedstock for
   solid fuel purpose.

AB This article reviews the performance, special features, and technical
   and/or economic barriers of various microalgae mass production methods
   including open-pond, photobioreactor, and immobilized culture systems.
   Open ponds are the least expensive among the three systems; however,
   issues of vulnerable species contamination, low productivity, high
   harvesting cost, and large volume of water loss have to be addressed.
   High biomass productivity and cell density, reduced contamination, and
   better use of CO2 are some advantages of photobioreactor systems, but
   the prohibitively high construction cost of photobioreactors still
   limits commercialization of such systems. Immobilized algae culture
   systems have great potential to obviate the harvesting problem of open
   ponds and photobioreactors and enhance biomass productivity; however,
   high material cost and limited choices of algae species require more
   investigation. Economics of algae biofuel manufacturing are also
   discussed. Algae biomass productivity, lipid content, and petroleum
   price are decisive factors in the economic viability of algae biofuels.

VL 13

U2 88
AB Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is the wastewater produced during the palm
   oil sterilization process, which contains substantial amounts of
   nutrients and phosphorous that are harmful to the environment. High BOD
   and COD of POME are as high as 100,000 mg/L, which endanger the
   environment. Effective pre-treatment of POME is required before
   disposal. As microalgae have the ability of biosorption on nutrients and
   phosphorous to perform photosynthesis, they can be utilized as a
   sustainable POME treatment operation, which contributes to effective
   biofuel production. Microalgae species C. pyrenoidosa has shown to
   achieve 68% lipid production along with 71% nutrient reduction in POME.
   In this study, a brief discussion about the impacts of POME that will
   affect the environment is presented. Additionally, the potential of
   microalgae in treating POME is evaluated along with its benefits.
   Furthermore, the condition of microalgae growth in the POME is also
   assessed to study the suitable condition for microalgae to be cultivated
   in. Moreover, experimental studies on characteristics and performance of
   microalgae are being evaluated for their feasibility. One of the
   profitable applications of POME treatment using microalgae is biofuel
   production, which will be discussed in this review. However, with the
   advantages brought from cultivating microalgae in POME, there are also
   some concerns, as microalgae will cause pollution if they are not
   handled well, as discussed in the last section of this paper.

AB Biomass production is currently explored in microalgae, macroalgae and
   land plants. Microalgal biofuel development has been performed mostly in
   green algae. In the Japanese tradition, macrophytic red algae such
   asPyropia yezoensisandGelidium crinalehave been utilized as food and
   industrial materials. Research on the utilization of unicellular red
   microalgae such asCyanidioschyzon merolaeandPorphyridium
   purpureumstarted only quite recently. Red algae have relatively large
   plastid genomes harboring more than 200 protein-coding genes that
   support the biosynthetic capacity of the plastid. Engineering the
   plastid genome is a unique potential of red microalgae. In addition,
   large-scale growth facilities ofP. purpureumhave been developed for
   industrial production of biofuels.C. merolaehas been studied as a model
   alga for cell and molecular biological analyses with its completely
   determined genomes and transformation techniques. Its acidic and warm
   habitat makes it easy to grow this alga axenically in large scales. Its
   potential as a biofuel producer is recently documented under
   nitrogen-limited conditions. Metabolic pathways of the accumulation of
   starch and triacylglycerol and the enzymes involved therein are being
   elucidated. Engineering these regulatory mechanisms will open a
   possibility of exploiting the full capability of production of biofuel
   and high added-value oil. In the present review, we will describe the
   characteristics and potential of these algae as biotechnological seeds.

AB The use of microalgae culture technology (MCT) for mitigating
   CO2emissions from flue gases and nutrient discharges from wastewater
   whilst generating a biofuel product is considered with reference to the
   cost benefit offered. The review examines the most recent MCT literature
   (post 2010) focused on the algal biomass or biofuel production cost. The
   analysis reveals that, according to published studies, biofuel cost
   follows an approximate inverse relationship with algal or lipid
   productivity with a minimum production cost of $1 L-1attained under
   representative conditions. A 35-86% cost reduction is reported across
   all studies from the combined harnessing of CO2and nutrients from waste
   sources. This compares with 12-27% for obviating fertiliser procurement
   through using a wastewater nutrient source (or else recycling the liquor
   from the extracted algal biomass waste), and 19-39% for CO2fixation from
   a flue gas feed. Notwithstanding the above, economic competitiveness
   with mineral fuels appears to be attainable only under circumstances
   which also feature: (a) The inclusion of cost and environmental benefits
   from wastewater treatment (such as the energy and/or greenhouse gas
   emissions benefit from nutrient and CO2discharge abatement), and/or (a)
   Multiple installations over an extended geographic region where flue gas
   and wastewater sources are co-located.

AB Hydrogen (H2) is an effective, environmentally friendly and renewable
   source of fuel that can be produced during dark- and photo-fermentation
   by different facultative and obligate anaerobic and purple bacteria and
   microalgae. This product is known as biohydrogen. It has the advantage
   of variable yield at low temperature (for mesophiles growing best at
   moderate temperature) and relatively low production cost, if compared
   with thermochemical methods. To develop fermentative H2 production
   biotechnology using cheap carbonaceous by-products and utilization of
   organic wastes, the selection or construction of effective bacterial
   strains and optimization of technology process conditions are required.
   Here we review recent new data that have been obtained with Escherichia
   coli, Clostridium beijerinskii, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and other
   bacteria. Activities of [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases of dark-fermentative
   bacteria and [Mo]-nitrogenase and [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenase of
   photo-fermentative species have been examined after growth with
   different carbon sources, using pure cultures, as well as co-culture and
   mixed-cultures technologies. Importantly, H2 production from cheap and
   readily available substrates like crude glycerol or different
   industrial, agricultural and other carbon-based wastes by bacteria is a
   sustainable technology. Consequently further approaches and
   strain-improvement could increase H2 production in a cost-effective way,
   and they will lead to both small- and large-scale H2 production.
   Moreover, they will provide significant economic and environmental
   benefits for renewable and sustainable energy supply in the near future.

AB Due to the growing need to provide alternatives to fossil fuels as
   efficiently, economically, and sustainably as possible there has been
   growing interest in improved biofuel production systems. Biofuels
   produced from microalgae are a particularly attractive option since
   microalgae have production potentials that exceed the best terrestrial
   crops by 2 to 10-fold. In addition, autotrophically grown microalgae can
   capture CO2from point sources reducing direct atmospheric greenhouse gas
   emissions. The enhanced biomass production potential of algae is
   attributed in part to the fact that every cell is photosynthetic.
   Regardless, overall biological energy capture, conversion, and storage
   in microalgae are inefficient with less than 8% conversion of solar into
   chemical energy achieved. In this review, we examine the thermodynamic
   and kinetic constraints associated with the autotrophic conversion of
   inorganic carbon into storage carbohydrate and oil, the dominant energy
   storage products in Chlorophytic microalgae. We discuss how
   thermodynamic restrictions including the loss of fixed carbon during
   acetyl CoA synthesis reduce the efficiency of carbon accumulation in
   lipids. In addition, kinetic limitations, such as the coupling of proton
   to electron transfer during plastoquinone reduction and oxidation and
   the slow rates of CO2fixation by Rubisco reduce photosynthetic
   efficiency. In some cases, these kinetic limitations have been overcome
   by massive increases in the numbers of effective catalytic sites, e.g.
   the high Rubisco levels (mM) in chloroplasts. But in other cases,
   including the slow rate of plastoquinol oxidation, there has been no
   compensatory increase in the abundance of catalytically limiting protein
   complexes. Significantly, we show that the energetic requirements for
   producing oil and starch relative to the recoverable energy stored in
   these molecules are very similar on a per carbon basis. Presently, the
   overall rates of starch and lipid synthesis in microalgae are very
   poorly characterized. Increased understanding of the kinetic constraints
   of lipid and starch synthesis, accumulation and turnover would
   facilitate the design of improved biomass production systems.

AB There is currently a renewed interest in developing microalgae as a
   source of renewable energy and fuel. Microalgae hold great potential as
   a source of biomass for the production of energy and fungible liquid
   transportation fuels. However, the technologies required for large-scale
   cultivation, processing, and conversion of microalgal biomass to energy
   products are underdeveloped. Microalgae offer several advantages over
   traditional 'first-generation' biofuels crops like corn: these include
   superior biomass productivity, the ability to grow on poor-quality land
   unsuitable for agriculture, and the potential for sustainable growth by
   extracting macro- and micronutrients from wastewater and industrial
   flue-stack emissions. Integrating microalgal cultivation with municipal
   wastewater treatment and industrial CO2emissions from coal-fired power
   plants is a potential strategy to produce large quantities of biomass,
   and represents an opportunity to develop, test, and optimize the
   necessary technologies to make microalgal biofuels more cost-effective
   and efficient. However, many constraints on the eventual deployment of
   this technology must be taken into consideration and mitigating
   strategies developed before large scale microalgal cultivation can
   become a reality. As a strategy for CO2biomitigation from industrial
   point source emitters, microalgal cultivation can be limited by the
   availability of land, light, and other nutrients like N and P. Effective
   removal of N and P from municipal wastewater is limited by the
   processing capacity of available microalgal cultivation systems.
   Strategies to mitigate against the constraints are discussed.

   popularity due to governmental regulations and in some cases economic
   incentives based on environmental concerns as well as a desire to reduce
   oil dependency. As a consequence, several countries are interested in
   developing their internal market for use of this biofuel. Currently,
   almost all bio-ethanol is produced from grain or sugarcane. However, as
   this kind of feedstock is essentially food, other efficient and
   economically viable technologies for ethanol production have been
   evaluated. This article reviews some current and promising technologies
   for ethanol production considering aspects related to the raw materials,
   processes, and engineered strains development. The main producer and
   consumer nations and future perspectives for the ethanol market are also
   presented. Finally, technological trends to expand this market are
   discussed focusing on promising strategies like the use of microalgae
   and continuous systems with immobilized cells.

AB Although algal biofuels hold great potential for renewable energy,
   production costs limit widespread technology adoption. Co-producing
   high-value products can ensure economic viability. We have discovered
   subcritical water will simultaneously convert algae, grown with
   reclaimed nutrients, into pure-phase substituted hydroxyapatite
   nanocrystals and a petroleum-like biocrude. The hydroxyapatite contains
   substitutions of carbonate, silicate, and magnesium, and can be easily
   modified to produce varying ratios of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium
   phosphate. The crystallization process is shown to undergo a nanoscale
   hierarchical order from long hexagonal crystals which aggregate to
   bundles, sheets, and flower-like microstructures. The hydroxyapatite
   promotesin situcatalytic upgrading of the biocrude product,
   particularly, the dehydration of fatty acid amides. Overall,in situoil
   upgrading provides a superior quality biocrude by reducing the oxygen
   content to <6.7% and resulting in >96% of the oil boiling below 600°C.
   Major compounds found within the biocrude include phenolics and
   unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition to heterogeneous catalysis, the
   hydroxyapatite product has significant promise for biomedical
   engineering applications. Herein, we demonstrate live cell-adhesion of
   human Wharton's jelly cells through extended filopodia on the
   hydroxyapatite product. This discovery establishes a new paradigm for
   water and nutrient reclamation systems and algae-based fuels and
   chemicals by producing a versatile high-value product, substituted
   hydroxyapatite, which can integrate into multiple markets and rapidly
   improve economic feasibility for algae biofuels.

AB With the rise of the concept of carbon neutrality, the current
   wastewater treatment process of industrial organic wastewater is moving
   towards the goal of energy conservation and carbon emission reduction.
   The advantages of anaerobic digestion (AD) processes in industrial
   organic wastewater treatment for bio-energy recovery, which is in line
   with the concept of carbon neutrality. This study summarized the
   significance and advantages of the state-of-the-art AD processes were
   reviewed in detail. The application of expanded granular sludge bed
   (EGSB) reactors and anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) were
   particularly introduced for the effective treatment of industrial
   organic wastewater treatment due to its remarkable prospect of
   engineering application for the high-strength wastewater. This study
   also looks forward to the optimization of the AD processes through the
   enhancement strategies of micro-aeration pretreatment, acidic-alkaline
   pretreatment, co-digestion, and biochar addition to improve the
   stability of the AD system and energy recovery from of industrial
   organic wastewater. The integration of anaerobic ammonia oxidation
   (Anammox) with the AD processes for the post-treatment of nitrogenous
   pollutants for the industrial organic wastewater is also introduced as a
   feasible carbon-neutral process. The combination of AnMBR and Anammox is
   highly recommended as a promising carbon-neutral process for the removal
   of both organic and inorganic pollutants from the industrial organic
   wastewater for future perspective. It is also suggested that the AD
   processes combined with biological hydrogen production, microalgae
   culture, bioelectrochemical technology and other bio-processes are
   suitable for the low-carbon treatment of industrial organic wastewater
   with the concept of carbon neutrality in future.

AB Microalgae and bacteria offer a huge potential in delving interest to
   study and explore various mechanisms under extreme environments. Acid
   mine drainage (AMD) is one such environment which is extremely acidic
   containing copious amounts of heavy metals and poses a major threat to
   the ecosystem. Despite its extreme conditions, AMD is the habitat for
   several microbes and their activities. The use of various chemicals in
   prevention of AMD formation and conventional treatment in a larger scale
   is not feasible under different geological conditions. It implies that
   microbe-mediated approach is a viable and sustainable alternative
   technology for AMD remediation. Microalgae in biofilms play a pivotal
   role in such bioremediation as they maintain mutualism with
   heterotrophic bacteria. Synergistic approach of using
   microalgae-bacteria biofilms provides supportive metabolites from algal
   biomass for growth of bacteria and mediates remediation of AMD. However,
   by virtue of their physiology and capabilities of metal removal,
   non-acidophilic microalgae can be acclimated for use in AMD remediation.
   A combination of selective acidophilic and non-acidophilic microalgae
   together with bacteria, all in the form of biofilms, may be very
   effective for bioremediation of metal-contaminated waters. The present
   review critically examines the nature of mutualistic interactions
   established between microalgae and bacteria in biofilms and their role
   in removal of metals from AMDs, and consequent biomass production for
   the yield of biofuel. Integration of microalgal-bacterial consortia in
   fuel cells would be an attractive emerging approach of microbial
   biotechnology for AMD remediation.

AB Biofuels have been shown to be a promising and highly attractive
   alternative for minimizing the use of fossil fuels, and microalgae have
   positioned themselves as potential candidates for production of lipids
   and other substances of commercial interest. We briefly review recent
   advances made in microalgae culture conditions and genetic manipulation
   for improving lipid yields for biofuel production - with both approaches
   showing similar yields of triacylglycerides, indicating that more work
   is required for improving lipid yield and accumulation in algae. Aiming
   at gaining knowledge of algae genetic manipulation and exploring future
   use of this information for modifying the lipid biosynthesis pathway, we
   investigated whether some characteristics of enzymes involved in lipid
   biosynthesis could relate to lipid yield and accumulation in algae. We
   made anin silicoanalysis of amino acid sequence of enzymatic domains and
   modeled tertiary structure of three proteins involved in the
   biosynthesis of lipids in microalgae: acetyl-CoA carboxylase, Acyl-CoA:
   diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and glycerol-3-phosphate
   acyltransferase. Our results suggest that, based on primary amino acid
   sequences and tertiary structure of proteins shared by certain algae, it
   is likely that these proteins may relate to lipid yield and
   accumulation, which makes bioinformatics a powerful tool forin
   silicostudy of proteins and for selecting genes involved in lipid
   biosynthesis that could be useful for heterologous transformation in
   algae with the long term objective of improving their yield,
   accumulation, and fatty acid composition by genetic engineering.

AB Industrial revolutions, advancements in health care, pharmaceuticals,
   transportation can be attributed to advancements made in the field of
   science and technology. Environment and natural resources has paid a
   heavy cost for most of industrial development. Rapid depletion of
   non-renewable sources of energy eventually leading towards the energy
   crisis, direct or indirect release of industrial effluents into soil and
   natural water bodies, global warming are among major consequences of
   industrialization. Ever since these environmental concerns have been
   recognized substantial studies have been conducted to minimize, control
   pollution and restore environment and natural resources. Among several
   measures cultivation of algae on large scale stands out to be a
   multipurpose solution. Inherent potential of microalgae species to
   accumulate lipids makes algae an efficient source of biofuel. Beside
   this ability of algae to detoxify polluted water and industrial effluent
   support utilization of algae for environment management and restoration.
   Efficient CO2 fixation, ability to tolerate wide range of environmental
   conditions, minimal nutritional requirements further support commercial
   cultivation of algal species to achieve their widespread application.
   However, efforts are required to develop large scale cultivation
   protocols (beyond the range of photobioreactors) so as to achieve
   practical applicability of algae and their products. Alongwith,
   cultivation protocols there is simultaneous need of either selection of
   naturally occurring high yielding strains/species or genetic
   improvement. Standardization of optimum cultivation conditions along
   with harvesting procedure is equally important.

AB The feasibility of growing microalgae in natural light using wastewater
   high in nutrients (N & P) for the production of more bioenergy was
   examined. The main retrofitting unit would be a photobioreactor for
   wastewater treatment plants (wwtp) having anaerobic digesters in close
   proximity. Theoretical microalgae production rates from different
   wastewater sources (municipal wwtp, source separation of human and
   animal wastewaters) were estimated using mass balance. Mass and energy
   balances for a conventional wwtp using chemically enhanced primary
   treatment was investigated for microalgae growth for a situation limited
   by availability of carbon dioxide (CO2) generated onsite and where
   additional CO2 was imported from outside source. Reject water from
   dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge from four wwtp around Oslo
   region were pretreated for improved light penetration and examined for
   microalgae growth. Several pre-treatment methods were investigated.
   Pretreatment using flocculation+settling+anthracite filtration yielded
   high light transmittance. A maximum microalgae growth rate of 13 g
   TSS/m2-d was achieved using this pretreated reject water. The challenges
   of integrating photobioreactors with existing units have been
   highlighted.

AB Efforts are intensifying to identify new biofuel sources in response to
   the pressing need to mitigate environmental pollutants, such as
   greenhouse gases, which are key contributors to global warming and
   various worldwide calamities. Algae and microalgae present themselves as
   excellent alternatives for solid-gaseous fuel production, given their
   renewable nature and non-polluting characteristics. However, making
   biomass production from these organisms economically feasible remains a
   challenge. This article collates various studies on the use of
   lignocellulosic waste, transforming it from environmental waste to
   valuable organic supplements for algae and microalgae cultivation. The
   focus is on enhancing biomass production and the metabolites derived
   from these biomasses.

AB Algal biofuels have been offered as an alternative to fossil fuels,
   based on claims that microalgae can provide a highly productive source
   of compounds as feedstocks for sustainable transport fuels. Life cycle
   analyses identify algal productivity as a critical factor affecting
   commercial and environmental viability. Here, we use mechanistic
   modelling of the biological processes driving microalgal growth to
   explore optimal production scenarios in an industrial setting, enabling
   us to quantify limits to algal biofuels potential. We demonstrate how
   physiological and operational trade-offs combine to restrict the
   potential for solar-powered algal-biodiesel production in open ponds to
   a ceiling of ca. 8000 L ha-1year-1. For industrial-scale operations,
   practical considerations limit production to ca. 6000 L ha-1year-1.
   According to published economic models and life cycle analyses, such
   production rates cannot support long-term viable commercialisation of
   solar-powered cultivation of natural microalgae strains exclusively as
   feedstock for biofuels. The commercial viability of microalgal biofuels
   depends critically upon limitations in microalgal physiology (primarily
   in rates of C-fixation); we discuss the scope for addressing this
   bottleneck concluding that even deployment of genetically modified
   microalgae with radically enhanced characteristics would leave a very
   significant logistical if not financial burden.

AB Butanol is highly toxic to cyanobacterial cells, which could restrict
   the future application of this renewable system in producing carbon
   neutral biofuel butanol. To seek knowledge regarding butanol tolerance
   in cyanobacteria, a library of response regulator (RR) gene mutants of
   Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was screened. The results showed that the
   deletion mutant of an orphan RR-encoding genes ll0039 was more sensitive
   to butanol than the wild type, while complementation of the
   &Delta;slr1037 mutant with the sll0039 gene recovered its tolerance to
   the same level as the wild type, suggesting that the sll0039 gene was
   involved in the regulation of tolerance against butanol. Further
   analysis employing an integrated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS)-based and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based
   metabolomics was conducted to determine the possible regulatory network
   of butanol tolerance mediated by Sll0039. LC-MS analysis allowed the
   identification of several metabolites, such as adenosine 5′-diphosphate
   (ADP)-glucose, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), D-ribose 5-phosphate
   (R5P), D-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), D-fructose 6-phosphate (F6P),
   alpha-ketoglutaric acid (AKG), uridine 5′-diphospho (UDP)-glucose, and
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which were
   differentially regulated between the wild type and the Deltasll0039
   mutant grown under butanol stress, while GC-MS analysis identified 1, 2,
   and 2 metabolic modules associated with the sll0039 gene deletion at 24,
   48, and 72 h, respectively, suggesting that they were under control
   directly or indirectly by Sll0039 RR. In addition, a metabolomic
   comparison of the metabolic responses to butanol stress was conducted in
   the Deltasll0039 mutant and the &Delta;slr1037 mutant previously found
   to be involved in butanol tolerance (Chen et al. Biotechnol Biofuels
   7:89 2014a), and the results showed that the regulatory networks
   mediated by Sll0039 and Slr1037 could be functionally independent in
   Synechocystis. The results provided a metabolomic description of the
   butanol tolerance network regulated by Sll0039.

AB In photosynthetic organisms, carotenoids serve essential roles in
   photosynthesis and photoprotection. A previous report designated CruP as
   a secondary lycopene cyclase involved in carotenoid biosynthesis
   [Maresca J, et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:11784-11789].
   However, we found that cruP KO or cruP overexpression plants do not
   exhibit correspondingly reduced or increased production of cyclized
   carotenoids, which would be expected if CruP was a lycopene cyclase.
   Instead, we show that CruP aids in preventing accumulation of reactive
   oxygen species (ROS), thereby reducing accumulation of
   beta-carotene-5,6-epoxide, a ROS-catalyzed autoxidation product, and
   inhibiting accumulation of anthocyanins, which are known chemical
   indicators of ROS. Plants with a nonfunctional cruP accumulate
   substantially higher levels of ROS and beta-carotene-5,6-epoxide in
   green tissues. Plants overexpressing cruP show reduced levels of ROS,
   beta-carotene-5,6-epoxide, and anthocyanins. The observed up-regulation
   of cruP transcripts under photoinhibitory and lipid
   peroxidation-inducing conditions, such as high light stress, cold
   stress, anoxia, and low levels of CO2, fits with a role for CruP in
   mitigating the effects of ROS. Phylogenetic distribution of CruP in
   prokaryotes showed that the gene is only present in cyanobacteria that
   live in habitats characterized by large variation in temperature and
   inorganic carbon availability. Therefore, CruP represents a unique
   target for developing resilient plants and algae needed to supply food
   and biofuels in the face of global climate change.

   outstanding examples of different research strategies on microalgae with
   biotechnological implications were presented, which suggested that
   integrative approaches will produce very significant advances in this
   field in the next future. In any case, intense research and the
   application of systems biology and genetic engineering techniques are

AB Solar energy is clearly a major future source of energy for humans.
   While solar photovoltaic and thermal harvesting are attractive there
   will be a need for biofuels to replace fossil fuels. Natural
   photosynthesis offers a means to do this, but photosynthesis is
   inherently inefficient. Terrestrial plants have already been used as a
   source of biofuels and this use will increase in the future, despite a
   number of attendant problems. Microalgae as a source of biofuels have to
   be technically proven and artificial photosynthesis/biohydrogen
   production lies further into the future. Consideration of these
   approaches must be weighed against (i) crop production in a hungry, as
   well as a fuel-hungry, world and (ii) the need to sustain biodiversity.

AB Hydrogen photoproduction from microalgae has been an emerging topic for

   seems to be the main challenge. Immobilization seems to be an
   alternative method for sustainable hydrogen generation. In this study we
   examined the bead stability, bead diameter and immobilization method in
   accordance with photobioreactors (PBR). 2.1 mm diameter beads were
   selected for PBR experiments. CSTR, tubular and panel type PBRs give

AB Background: Microalgae are widely be used in carbon sequestration, food
   supplements, natural pigments, polyunsaturated fatty acids, biofuel
   applications, and wastewater treatment. However, the difficulties
   incurred in algae cell separation and harvesting, and the exorbitant
   cost required to overcome these challenges, are the primary limitations
   to large-scale industrial application of microalgae technology. Results:
   Herein, we explore the potential of inducing flocculation by adjusting
   the pH for pre-concentratingEuglena gracilis. Our results demonstrate
   that flocculation can be induced by increasing the medium pH to 8.5;
   however, most of the algae cells were broken by increasing the pH > 10.
   Magnesium phosphate, calcium phosphate, and their derivatives
   precipitation jointly led to flocculation, although calcium phosphate
   and its derivatives precipitation had a greater effect. Conclusions:
   This study demonstrates that pH treatment-induced flocculation is
   efficient and feasible for the pre-concentration ofE. gracilisunder a
   pilot-scale culture system. Moreover, it also maintained the microalgae
   cells' integrity, chlorophyll production, and increased paramylon
   production. These findings provide a theoretical basis for reducing the
   cost of large-scaleE. gracilisharvesting; as well as provide a reference
   for harvesting other microalgae.

AB In recent years microalgae have attracted significant interest as a
   potential source of sustainable biofuel. Mixotrophic microalgae are able
   to simultaneously photosynthesise while assimilating and metabolising
   organic carbon. By combining autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic
   pathways biomass productivity can be significantly increased. In this
   study, acetate-fed mixotrophic Micractinium inermum cultures were found
   to have a specific growth rate 1.74 times the sum of autotrophic and
   heterotrophic growth. It was hypothesised that gas exchange between the
   two metabolic pathways within mixotrophic cultures may have prevented
   growth limitation and enhanced growth. To determine the extent of
   synergistic gas exchange and its influence on metabolic activity,
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and
   photosynthesis and respiration rates were measured under different
   trophic conditions. A 32.7 fold and 2.4 fold increase in DIC and DO
   concentrations, relative to autotrophic and heterotrophic cultures
   respectively, were coupled with significant increases in rates of
   photosynthesis and respiration. These data strongly support the
   hypothesis of mixotrophic gas exchange within M. inermum cultures. In
   addition to enhanced growth, this phenomenon may provide reductions in
   aeration and oxygen stripping costs related to microalgae production.

AB Blue biotechnology can greatly help solve some of the most serious
   social problems due to its wide biodiversity, which includes marine
   environments. Microalgae are important resources for human needs as an
   alternative to terrestrial plants because of their rich biodiversity,
   rapid growth, and product contributions in many fields. The production
   scheme for microalgae biomass mainly consists of two processes: (I) the
   Build-Up process and (II) the Pull-Down process. The Build-Up process
   consists of (1) the super strain concept and (2) cultivation aspects.
   The Pull-Down process includes (1) harvesting and (2) drying algal
   biomass. In some cases, such as the manufacture of algal products, the
   (3) extraction of bioactive compounds is included. Microalgae have a
   wide range of commercial applications, such as in aquaculture,
   biofertilizer, bioenergy, pharmaceuticals, and functional foods, which
   have several industrial and academic applications around the world. The
   efficiency and success of biomedical products derived from microalgal
   biomass or its metabolites mainly depend on the technologies used in the
   cultivation, harvesting, drying, and extraction of microalgae bioactive
   molecules. The current review focuses on recent advanced technologies
   that enhance microalgae biomass within microalgae production schemes.
   Moreover, the current work highlights marine drugs and human health
   products derived from microalgae that can improve human immunity and
   reduce viral activities, especially COVID-19.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and
   coal are primary contributors of greenhouse gases leading to global
   climate change and warming. The toxicity of heavy metals and metalloids
   in the environment threatens ecological functionality, diversity and
   global human life. The ability of microalgae to thrive in harsh
   environments such as industrial wastewater, polluted lakes, and
   contaminated seawaters presents new, environmentally friendly, and less
   expensive CO2remediation solutions. Numerous microalgal species grown in
   wastewater for industrial purposes may absorb and convert nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and organic matter into proteins, oil, and carbohydrates. In
   any multi-faceted micro-ecological system, the role of bacteria and
   their interactions with microalgae can be harnessed appropriately to
   enhance microalgae performance in either wastewater treatment or algal
   production systems. This algal-bacterial energy nexus review focuses on
   examining the processes used in the capture, storage, and biological
   fixation of CO2by various microalgal species, as well as the optimized
   production of microalgae in open and closed cultivation systems.
   Microalgal production depends on different biotic and abiotic variables

AB The past decade has seen a rapid increase of numerical simulation
   studies on photobioreactors (PBRs). Developments in computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) and the availability of more powerful computers have
   paved the way for the modeling and designing PRBs, a strategy that was
   abandoned from the late 1970s until the 1980s because of its complexity.
   This paper reviews the present status of numerical modeling for PBRs as
   well the application of CFD in the design of PBR for the mass production
   of microalgae. Emphasis is on the major breakthroughs in PBR design that
   may lead to scaling-up. Most simulations have been conducted in bubble
   column PBRs, which offer many advantages. Their geometry is simple in
   design with no moving parts, and they are easy to construct and operate.
   A majority of published simulation studies used two-phase models (air
   and water) and employed the Eulerian-Eulerian mixture model. CFD models
   have been vigorously validated by experimental and laboratory studies,
   with most claiming to have achieved good results. However, current PBR
   scale-up projects still need to resolve hydrodynamic issues within the
   PBR, in order to optimize factors for microalgal growth. To create ideal
   conditions inside the PBR, the main factors that influence microalgal
   growth such as light intensity and distribution, gas injection and
   mixing, and hydrodynamics/flow pattern which are the key for design and
   scale up must be thoroughly understood. The present practice of PBR
   design using CFD can be considered both an art and a science because of
   some numerical simulation issues which are yet to be resolved and the
   complexity of fluid mechanics inside the PBRs. Nonetheless, CFD has
   proven to be an effective tool in predicting the complex inherent
   phenomena in the PBRs. The CFD technique has shown to be very promising
   to successfully design and develop PBRs which can be commercially
   available for scale-up.

AB This work reviews retrofitting new waste energy, carbon and water
   intensive technologies into existing industrial facilities (including

   efficiencies. The three applications reviewed are microalgal ponds
   consuming flue gasses and providing thermal power station cooling
   services, thermally driven membrane distillation desalination, and
   hydrometallurgical solution mining processes to indirectly remove water
   contaminants, and additional power station cooling. The aim of this work
   is to explore the unique challenge of site-specificity of retrofitting
   any or all of the reviewed technologies within existing facilities for
   commercial operations. The theoretical basis behind higher aggregated
   efficiencies is essentially vertical integration of infrastructure,
   energy, and material flows, reducing total costs, net waste, and
   associated potential environmental contamination. Whilst solution mining
   and some thermal desalination technologies are not necessarily new in
   isolation, new technical developments enable these technologies to use
   waste heat and waste water by operating in parallel with industrial
   facilities, and effectively subsidise microalgae biofuel water pumping
   and dewatering. This research determines three fundamental developments
   are required to enable wide-scale industrial co-located vertical
   integration efficiencies: (1) fundamental engineering, (2) monitoring
   system innovation, and (3) technology/knowledge transfer.

U1 17
U2 20
AB Efficient microalgae harvesting and dewatering are critical processes
   for a range of applications, including the production of raw materials,
   nutritional supplements, pharmaceuticals, sustainable biofuels, and
   wastewater treatment. The optimization of these processes poses
   significant challenges due to the need for high efficiency and
   sustainability while managing costs and energy consumption. This review
   comprehensively addresses these challenges by focusing on the
   development and application of various membrane filtration technologies
   specifically designed for the effective harvesting and dewatering of
   algal biomass. Membrane filtration has emerged as a predominant method
   due to its ability to handle large volumes of microalgae with relatively
   low energy requirements. This review systematically examines the
   different membrane-based technologies and their effectiveness in
   recovering valuable components from algal biomass, such as lipids,
   proteins, and carbohydrates. The discussion begins with an overview of
   the physical characteristics of microalgae and their cultivation
   conditions, which are critical for understanding how these factors
   influence the performance of membrane filtration processes. Key aspects
   such as the features of algal cells, the presence of algal organic
   matter, and transparent exopolymer particles are explored in detail. The
   review also delves into various strategies for improving membrane
   antifouling properties, which are essential for maintaining the
   efficiency and longevity of the filtration systems. In addition, the
   advantages and disadvantages of different membrane techniques are
   reviewed, highlighting their respective performance in separating
   microalgae and dewatering. Finally, the review offers insights into
   future research directions and technological advancements that could
   further enhance the efficiency and sustainability of microalgae
   processing. This comprehensive evaluation aims to provide a thorough
   understanding of current membrane technologies, their applications, and
   the ongoing developments necessary to overcome existing limitations and
   improve overall process performance.

AB A novel and comprehensive multiphysics numerical simulation model for
   microalgal pneumatic photobioreactors was developed using the
   open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software OpenFOAM. This
   model integrates three distinct submodels: multiphase fluid dynamics,
   light transport, and microalgae growth. In particular, the light
   transport submodel accounts for light scattering caused by air bubbles.
   The model effectively addressed the challenges associated with the
   disparate time scales of the submodels, and its accuracy was validated
   by comparing with several experiments in different configurations. This
   study focuses on how an outdoor flat plate photobioreactor can maximize
   solar energy utilization. The results indicate that the daily
   productivity of the light-intensity adaptive reactor increased by 12.31%
   to 26.31% compared to those at constant biomass concentrations,
   demonstrating significant potential for employing this model in
   conjunction with automated systems to enhance productivity.

AB Biofuels provided 2.7% of world's transportation fuel in 2015 which is
   expected to rise to 28% by 2050. However, most of the biofuel produced
   till date is from crops that can be used as food or feed. Microalgae, or
   third generation biomass, has the potential to overcome the problems
   associated with the food vs. fuel debate. Microalgae are microscopic
   photosynthetic organisms which have the ability to fix CO2.
   Thermochemical conversion via hydrothermal liquefaction is a favourable
   technology for recovering energy from algal biomass. Research is focused
   on discovering a viable and sustainable feedstock by cultivating and
   up-scaling the use of microalgae and then utilizing hydrothermal
   liquefaction to produce a workable biofuel. Synthetic biology and
   several genetic engineering techniques have also shown promising results
   in the production of biofuels. Much research is being carried out using
   microalgae as biomass for biofuel generation; however, it needs a robust
   conversion technology to make the process commercially viable.

AB Microalgae have significant potential to form the basis of the next
   biofuel revolution. They have high growth and solar energy conversion
   rates. Furthermore, their osmotolerance, metabolic diversity and
   capacity to produce large amounts of lipids have attracted considerable
   interest. Although there are a handful of commercially successful
   examples of the photoautotrophic mass-culture of algae, these have
   focused on the production of higher value products (pigments,
   health-foods etc.). The technical and commercial challenges to develop
   an economically viable process for biofuels are considerable and it will
   require much further R&D. In this paper the biological constraints, with
   a particular focus on strain selection are discussed.

AB Integrating microalgae systems (MAS) at municipal wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTPs) to produce of bioenergy offers many potential synergies.
   Improved energy balances provide a strong incentive for WWTPs to
   integrate MAS, but it is crucial that WWTPs maintain their barrier
   function to protect water resources. We perform a prospective analysis
   of energy and emission balances of a WWTP with integrated MAS, based on
   a substance flow analysis of the elements carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and
   phosphorus (P). These elements are the main ingredients of wastewater,
   and the key nutrients for algae growth. We propose a process design
   which relies solely on resources from wastewater with no external input
   of water, fertilizer or CO2. The whole process chain, from cultivation
   to production of bioelectricity, takes place at the WWTP. Our results
   show that MAS can considerably improve energy balances of WWTPs without
   any external resource input. With optimistic assumptions, they can turn
   WWTPs into net energy producers. While intensive C recycling in MAS
   considerably improves the energy balance, we show that it also impacts
   on effluent quality. We discuss the importance of nonharvested biomass
   for effluent quality and highlight harvesting efficiency as key factor
   for energy and emission balances of MAS at WWTP.

AB Microalgae, also known as phytoplankton, are abundant microorganisms,
   which are found in freshwater and marine environments. Phytoplankton are
   critical to global biogeochemistry since they produce the bulk of oxygen
   on Earth through photosynthesis. They form the base of the marine food
   web and are primary producers of organic carbon. Microalgal species can
   synthesize high value chemical products, such as carotenoids,
   antioxidants, fatty acids, and sterols. Most recently, microalgae have
   become an attractive raw material of biofuel, in the form of biodiesel.
   This book describes the latest research and newest approaches to the
   study of these important organisms, as well as covering the more
   traditional methods such as morphotaxonomy. Practical information is
   first provided on cultivation of phytoplankton, growth media and
   division rates for different algal species, optical techniques and
   automated instrumentation, such as flow cytometry. Furthermore, methods
   and approaches to study gene expression and regulation in phytoplankton
   are reviewed. A separate chapter is dedicated to the discussion of algal
   blooms and their effects on local environments. CoccolithophoreEmiliania
   huxleyiand bioluminescent microalgae are thoroughly reviewed by experts
   in those fields. Finally, this book reviews the state-of-the-art of
   microfluidic andin situsensors for phytoplankton identification. This
   volume could be an indispensable tool for anyone working in this field,
   or who wishes to learn more about these microorganisms.

U1 0
U2 18
AB Developing an efficient photobioreactor (PBR) and reducing freshwater
   dependence are among the significant challenges for generating 3rd
   generation biomass feedstock. Addressing these, the present study
   focused on developing a modified airlift (MoAL) PBR. Its performance was
   further evaluated and compared with the traditional airlift PBR by
   cultivating microalgae in dark fermentation spent wash. Lower mixing
   time and higher interfacial mass transfer coefficient was observed in
   the MoAL PBR having a perforated draft tube. Experimentally, the MoAL
   exhibited the maximum biomass concentration of 3.18 g L-1, which was 30%
   higher than that of the conventional airlift PBR. The semi-continuous
   operation of the MoAL (with water recycling) achieved the maximum
   biomass productivity of 0.83 g L-1d-1, two folds superior to that of
   batch culture. The comprehensive biomass characterization (proximate,
   ultimate, and thermochemical) further confirmed its potential for
   bioenergy application. Considering that, hydrothermal liquefaction of
   the biomass resulted in a maximum biocrude yield of 31% w/w with a
   higher heating value (HHV) of 36.6 MJ kg-1. In addition, the biocrude
   comprised 66.6% w/w lighter fraction (<343°C), including 21.5% w/w of
   heavy naphtha, 20.5% w/w of kerosene, and 24.6% w/w of diesel. The
   results can help develop sustainable technology for simultaneous
   wastewater remediation and biocrude production.

AB Microalgae have been considered as a promising biomass for biofuel
   production, but freshwater resource consumption during the scaled-up
   cultivation are still a challenge. Obtaining robust marine strains
   capable of producing triacylglycerols and high value-added metabolites
   are critical for overcoming the limitations of water resources and
   economical feasibility. In this study, a marine microalga with lipid and
   astaxanthin accumulation capability was isolated from Bohai Bay, China.
   The alga was named asCoelastrumsp. HA-1 based on its morphological and
   molecular identification. The major characteristics of HA-1 and the
   effects of nitrogen on its lipid and astaxanthin accumulations were
   investigated. Results indicated that the highest biomass, lipid and
   astaxanthin yields achieved were 50.9 g m-2day-1, 18.0 g m-2day-1and
   168.9 mg m-2day-1, respectively, after cultivation for 24 days. The
   fatty acids of HA-1, identified in their majority as oleic acid (56.6%)
   and palmitic acid (25.9%), are desirable biofuel feedstocks. In
   addition, this alga can be harvested with simple sedimentation,
   achieving 98.2% removal efficiency after settling for 24 h. These
   results suggest thatCoelastrumsp. HA-1 has several desirable key
   features that make it a potential candidate for biofuel production.

AB Many microalgae accumulate oils, especially under stress conditions,
   thus have attracted more and more attention as a potential feedstock for
   biodiesel production. However, little information is available for
   molecular mechanisms that control oil accumulation in microalgae. In
   this study, we investigated the accumulation of oils during nitrogen (N)
   deprivation in the model green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our
   results indicated that oil content significantly increased after N
   deficiency in C. reinhardtii, which was accompanied by a drastic
   decrease (63-91%) in the transcript level of phosphoenolpyruvate
   carboxylase 2 (PEPC2), an enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
   to oxaloacetate (OAA), which conjugates with acetyl-CoA to generate
   citric acid. Furthermore, down regulation of pepc2 gene by RNAi
   silencing in C. reinhardtii led to 14-28% increase in oil content. These
   results revealed a negative correlation between pepc2 mRNA abundance and
   oil content in C. reinhardtii.

AB The search for novel compounds of marine origin has increased in the
   last decades for their application in various areas such as
   pharmaceutical, human or animal nutrition, cosmetics or bioenergy. In
   this context of blue technology development, microalgae are of
   particular interest due to their immense biodiversity and their
   relatively simple growth needs. In this review, we discuss about the
   promising use of microalgae and microalgal compounds as sources of
   natural antibiotics against human pathogens but also about their
   potential to limit microbial infections in aquaculture. An alternative
   to conventional antibiotics is needed as the microbial resistance to
   these drugs is increasing in humans and animals. Furthermore, using
   natural antibiotics for livestock could meet the consumer demand to
   avoid chemicals in food, would support a sustainable aquaculture and
   present the advantage of being environmentally friendly. Using natural
   and renewable microalgal compounds is still in its early days, but
   considering the important research development and rapid improvement in
   culture, extraction and purification processes, the valorization of
   microalgae will surely extend in the future.

AB Microalgae are autotroph organisms that utilise light energy to
   synthesize various high-value bioactive compounds such as
   polysaccharides, proteins and lipids. Due to its fast growth rate and
   capability to survive in harsh environment, microalgae nowadays are
   applied in various industrial areas. The process of obtaining
   microalgae-based biomolecules starts with the selection of suitable
   microalgae strain, cultivation, followed by downstream processing of the
   biomass (i.e., pre-treatment, harvesting, extraction and purification).
   The end products of the processes are biofuels and other valuable
   bioproducts. Nevertheless, low production yield and high-cost downstream
   processes are the emerging bottlenecks which need to be addressed in the
   upscaling of extracted compounds from microalgae biomass. To conclude,
   tremendous efforts are required to overcome these challenges to
   revolutionize microalgae into a novel and green factory of different
   bioactive compounds for industrial necessities to satisfy and fulfil
   global demands.

AB In this study, the effects of strigolactone (SL) on the biomass, lipid
   content, biochemical properties, and gene transcription of Monoraphidium
   sp. QLY-1 were examined. The lipid content and lipid productivity
   increased by 61% and 55% in QLY-1 under 1 M SL induction compared to the
   control group, respectively. SL also upregulated the levels of
   endogenous NO and Ca2+ and lipid biosynthesis gene transcription.
   Subsequently, the relationship between Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) in the
   regulation of cell growth and lipid accumulation of QLY-1 under SL
   induction conditions was analysed. An increase in endogenous Ca2+
   regulated cell growth and lipid biosynthesis by modulating the levels of
   NO and lipid biosynthesis-related gene expression. Collectively, this
   study provided a valuable approach for biofuel production from
   microalgae under SL induction and demonstrated that there is crucial
   crosstalk between the Ca2+ and NO signalling in the manipulation of
   lipid biosynthesis in microalgae under SL treatment.

AB Algae production process is a key cost center in production of
   biofuels/bioproducts from microalgae. Decline in the growth of algae in
   outdoor ponds during non-optimal conditions is one of the hurdles for
   achieving consistently high algal production rates. An optimal
   controller can be used to overcome this limitation and provide reliable
   growth in outdoor conditions. A model predictive controller (MPC) was
   developed to optimize the algal growth, predicted by flux balance
   analysis, under natural disturbances, embedding within the cost
   function, the economic and environmental constraints associated with the
   process. The model, developed in MATLAB, was validated on a 30-L
   continuous algal culture under light, temperature and a combination of
   light and temperature disturbances. The MPC proved effective in
   minimization of a decrease in growth under these natural disturbances.
   The growth rates with MPC were observed to be 79-116% higher as compared
   to the non-MPC growth.

AB Over the last decade, the use of microalgae for biofuel production and
   carbon dioxide sequestration has become a challenge worldwide.
   Processing costs are still too high for these methods to be profitable
   though, leading to a need to find high value by-products to optimise the
   added value of this biomass. For high-throughput screening of such
   metabolites, it is essential to reach the inner content of the cell.
   This paper presents research and development of a technique enabling a
   high extraction yield of any metabolite, taking into account the
   difficulty of extracting bound and or inaccessible molecules with a wide
   variety of polarities. To this end, several disruption techniques were
   tested at laboratory scale on two biological models: Porphyridium
   purpureum and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. A mixer mill gave the best
   results, offering access to a broad diversity of metabolites from
   microalgae for high-throughput screening.

AB Microalgae lipid triacylglycerol is considered as a promising feedstock
   for national production of biofuels. A hotspot issue in the biodiesel
   study is to increase TAG content and productivity of microalgae.
   Precursor RNA processing protein (Prp19), which is the core component of
   eukaryotic RNA splice NTC (nineteen associated complex), plays important
   roles in the mRNA maturation process in eukaryotic cells, has a variety
   of functions in cell development, and is even directly involved in the
   biosynthesis of oil bodies in mouse. Nevertheless, its function in
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii remains unknown. Here, transcriptional level
   of CrPrp19 under nutrition deprivation was analyzed, and both its RNA
   interference and overexpressed transformants were constructed. The
   expression level of CrPrp19 was suppressed by nitrogen or sulfur
   deficiency. Cell densities of CrPrp19 RNAi lines decreased, and their
   neutral lipid contents increased 1.33 and 1.34 times over those of
   controls. The cells of CrPrp19 RNAi lines were larger and more resistant
   to sodium acetate than control. Considerably none of the alterations in
   growth or neutral lipid contents was found in the CrPrp19 overexpression
   transformants than wild type. Fatty acids were also significantly
   increased in CrPrp19 RNAi transformants. Subcellular localization and
   yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that CrPrp19 was a nuclear protein,
   which might be involved in cell cycle regulation. In conclusion, CrPrp19
   protein was necessary for negatively regulating lipid enrichment and
   cell size, but not stimulatory for lipid storage.

AB Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing
   biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome
   before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is
   the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting
   biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach
   was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and 243 compounds were identified that
   increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth.
   Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15
   were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth
   fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch
   concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids,
   and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using
   liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry.
   These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily
   proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling
   provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different
   compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with
   regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle,
   tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
   Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other
   abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The
   efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal
   species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools
   for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in
   algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the
   severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.

AB Microalgae are promising sources of valuable bioproducts such as
   biofuels, food, and nutraceuticals. However, harvesting microalgae is
   challenging due to their small size and low biomass concentrations. To
   address this challenge, bio-flocculation of starchless mutants
   ofChlamydomonas reinhardtii(sta6/sta7) was investigated withMortierella
   alpina, an oleaginous fungus with high concentrations of arachidonic
   acid (ARA). Triacylglycerides (TAG) reached 85% of total lipids
   insta6andsta7through a nitrogen regime. Scanning electron microscopy
   determined cell-wall attachment and extra polymeric substances (EPS) to
   be responsible for flocculation. An algal-fungal biomass ratio around
   1:1 (three membranes) was optimal for bio-flocculation (80-85%
   flocculation efficiency in 24 h). Nitrogen-deprivedsta6/sta7were
   flocculated with strains ofM. alpina(NVP17b, NVP47, and NVP153) with
   aggregates exhibiting fatty acid profiles similar toC. reinhardtii, with
   ARA (3-10% of total fatty acids). This study showcasesM. alpinaas a

AB Microalgae are potential biofuel feedstocks for production of
   energy-dense triacylglycerols (TAG). Nitrogen deprivation is known to
   trigger microalgal TAG accumulation by upregulation of de novo fatty
   acid (FA) biosynthesis through chloroplast-localized Type II FA
   synthases (FAS). To gain insights into the associated FAS regulatory
   mechanisms, we applied a recently reported liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry method to examine acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) pool
   compositional changes of the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii over a
   nitrogen deprivation time-course. We observed that acyl-ACP pools are
   highly enriched in acetyl-ACP in nutrient-rich media in
   photoheterotrophically grown cells. Following shift to nitrogen
   deprivation, acetyl-ACP markedly decreased, and long-chain palmitoyl
   (16:0)-, stearoyl (18:0)-, and oleoyl (18:1)-ACPs progressively
   predominated in acyl-ACP pools in parallel with increases in FA and TAG
   production. This study shows the utility of microalgal cells to study
   acyl-ACP pool dynamics to gain insights into plant FA biosynthetic
   regulation and oil enhancement strategies.

AB Economic and ecological reasons cause the industry to develop new
   innovative bio-based processes for the production of oil as renewable
   feedstock. Petroleum resources are expected to be depleted in the near
   future. Plant oils as sole substituent are highly criticized because of
   the competitive utilization of the agricultural area for food and energy
   feedstock production. Microbial lipids of oleaginous microorganisms are
   therefore a suitable alternative. To decrease production costs of
   microbial lipids and gain spatial independence from industrial sites of
   CO2emission, a combination of heterotrophic and phototrophic cultivation
   with integrated CO2recycling was investigated in this study. A
   feasibility study on a semi-pilot scale was conducted and showed that
   the cultivation of the oleaginous yeastCryptococcus curvatuson a 1.2-L
   scale was sufficient to supply a culture of the oleaginous
   microalgaePhaeodactylum tricornutumin a 21-L bubble column reactor with
   CO2while single cell oils were produced in both processes due to a
   nutrient limitation.

AB The potential of microalgae as a biomass feedstock for biofuels,
   bioproducts and as a technological solution for CO2fixation is subject
   to intense academic and industrial researches. However, current
   microalgal mass culture technologies have failed to produce bulk volume
   of microalgal biomass at low cost, because the contaminations of
   biological pollutants become a big constraint in mass cultivation and
   impede the industrial process. Here the transmission routes,
   contamination mechanisms of biological pollutants both in open ponds and
   photobioreactors are described and recent attempts to overcome the
   barrier are reviewed. What worth noting, unlike conventional microbial
   fermentation which uses a pure monoculture, the cultivation of
   microalgae is a complicated symbiotic system of
   microalgae-bacterial-zooplankton where the target microalgae dominate,
   cross infection or contamination by biological pollutants is inevitable
   and it will require much further research. Further investigation and
   development of control methods are necessary, particularly microalgal
   strain selection.

AB In order to clarify the relationship of lipid and starch metabolism in
   microalgae, with Ankistrodesmus sp. HJ12 as the experimental material,
   its biomass, lipid contents and starch contents were measured under
   different nitrogen concentrations, and comparative transcriptome were
   studied. The correlation between microalgae lipid and starch
   accumulation was explored and their molecular regulation mechanisms were
   investigated. The results showed that nitrogen concentration remarkedly
   influenced lipid and starch accumulation in Ankistrodesmus sp. HJ12, and
   there was a negative correlation between them. The lipid contents of
   algal cells cultured in media with nitrogen were significantly higher
   than those in nitrogen-free media. The optimal nitrogen concentration
   for lipid accumulation was 7.6 mmol/L. In contrast, the starch contents
   of algal cells were the highest in nitrogen-free media. Comparative
   transcriptome analysis showed that genes involved in fatty acid
   synthesis, glycolytic and amylolytic pathway were expressed at higher
   levels in Ankistrodesmus sp. HJ12 than the control, implying that the
   cells accumulated more acetyl-CoA and carbon source for fatty acid
   synthesis under nitrogen limitation, and promoting the synthesis of
   fatty acids. Moreover, four key genes of regulating lipids anabolism,
   ACACA, alpha-AMY, PDC and adh, were selected for RT-qPCR analysis, and
   the results of gene expression partterns were in consistent with those
   obtain by transcriptome analysis. The results of the study provided a
   basis to deeply understand the molecular mechanism of microalgae lipids
   anabolism. In addition, it added a new favorable foundation for
   accelerating producing biodiesel from microalgae lipids to achieve
   large-scale applications.

AB Microalgae biomass has been considered as one of the potential
   feedstocks in biofuel production. Yet, biomass harvesting poses a
   challenge to the overall production cost due to its low cell density.
   Flocculation has been marked as one of the promising processes in
   microalgae harvesting technology. In this study, the first screening of
   two anionic (A-230, and A-330E) and five cationic polymers (C-810E,
   C-810EL, C-810EB, C-810ELH, and C-810EMB) followed by gravity settling
   with the mixed microalgae concentration of 2.24 gTSS/L revealed that
   anionic polymers are less effective. Whereas all cationic polymers
   achieved above 90% harvesting efficiency. Therefore, the maximum mass
   recovery of 98.7% with 86.8 gTSS/L sediment content was achieved by
   adjusting pH to 6-0.6 mL/L (115.178 mg/gbiomass) of C-810E followed by
   15-min settling. The cationic polymer addition followed by settling
   would enable cost-effective downstream processing of microalgal biomass.

AB Stress to an algal species can be caused by several factors ranging from
   temperature extremes to varying light intensities under which they
   accumulate lipids. Stress caused by nutrient limitation is known to
   induce maximum lipid accumulation in microalgae. In order to obtain an
   appropriate phosphate concentration exhibiting both high biomass and
   high lipid contents, four different concentrations of phosphate were
   implemented. Mechanism of lipid accumulation was also studied. Of the
   tested concentrations, no significant difference between growth rates
   was observed. Cultures with phosphate concentration 2.7 mg/l exhibited
   maximum increase in biomass productivity compared to control. But
   phosphate concentration 0.5 mg/l demonstrated the highest lipid
   productivity (8.75 mg/l/day), in accordance with lipid content (21.8%).
   Further, representation of TEM and fluorescent microscopic images
   depicted differences in lipid accumulation and sub-cellular
   ultrastructure at different concentrations of phosphate. Disappearance
   of phosphate and nitrate from the medium was also evaluated to study the
   efficient nutrient concentration and to better understand mechanism of

AB Background: Diatoms are an ecologically relevant group of microalgae
   that are not commonly considered for bio-oil production even if they are
   responsible for massive blooms at sea. Seventeen diatom species were
   screened for their capacity to produce biomass and lipids, in relation
   to their growth rate. Triglyceride levels were also assessed as a
   preferential source of biofuels. Results: Using statistical analysis,
   two centric diatoms,Thalassiosira weissflogiiandCyclotella cryptica,
   were selected as good candidates for oil production. Lipid levels
   significantly increased when the two diatoms were cultivated in a
   two-stage process under nitrogen limitation. The effect was less
   pronounced in cultures where silicon was reduced to 20% of the standard
   supply. Nitrogen limitation did not affect growth rates but led to lipid
   remodeling andde novosynthesis of triacylglycerols. Conclusions:
   Triacylglycerols inT. weissflogiiandC. crypticacan account for up to 82%
   and 88% of total glycerolipids, thereby suggesting that the two species
   are promising candidates for large-scale experimentation for biofuel
   production.

AB Microalgae hold promise for the production of sustainable replacement of
   fossil fuels due to their high growth rates, ability to grow on
   non-arable land and their high content, under the proper conditions, of
   high energy compounds that can be relatively easily chemically converted
   to fuels using existing technology. However, projected large-scale algal
   production raises a number of sustainability concerns concerning land
   use, net energy return, water use and nutrient supply. The
   state-of-the-art of algal production of biofuels is presented with
   emphasis on some possible avenues to provide answers to the
   sustainability questions that have been raised. Here, issues concerning
   algal strains and supply of nutrients for large-scale production are
   discussed. Since sustainability concerns necessitate the use of
   wastewaters for supply of bulk nutrients, emphasis is placed on the
   composition and suitability of different wastewater streams. At the same
   time, algal cultivation has proven useful in waste treatment processes,
   and thus this aspect is also treated in some detail.

AB Microalgae have drawn great attention as promising sustainable source of
   lipids and carotenoids. Their lipid and carotenoids accumulation
   machinery can be trigged by the stress conditions such as nutrient
   limitation or exposure to the damaging physical factors. However,
   stressful conditions often adversely affect microalgal growth and cause
   oxidative damage to the cells, which can eventually reduce the yield of
   the desired products. To overcome these limitations, two-stage
   cultivation strategies and supplementation of growth-promoting agents
   have traditionally been utilized, but developing new highly adapted
   strains is theoretically the simplest strategy. In addition to genetic
   engineering, adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) is frequently used to
   develop beneficial phenotypes in industrial microorganisms during
   long-term selection under specific stress conditions. In recent years,
   many studies have gradually introduced ALE as a powerful tool to improve
   the biological properties of microalgae, especially for improving the
   production of lipid and carotenoids. In this review, strategies for the
   manipulation of stress in microalgal lipids and carotenoids production
   are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, this review summarizes the
   overall state of ALE technology, including available selection
   pressures, methods, and their applications in microalgae for the
   improved production of lipids and carotenoids.

AB To date, feedstock resource assessments have evaluated cellulosic and
   algal feedstocks independently, without consideration of demands for,
   and resource allocation to, each other. We assess potential land
   competition between algal and terrestrial feedstocks in the United
   States, and evaluate a scenario in which 41.5*109L yr-1of
   second-generation biofuels are produced on pastureland, the most likely
   land base where both feedstock types may be deployed. Under this
   scenario, open-pond microalgae production is projected to use 1.2*106ha
   of private pastureland, while terrestrial biomass feedstocks would use
   14.0*106ha of private pastureland. A spatial meta-analysis indicates
   that potential competition for land under this scenario would be
   concentrated in 110 counties, containing 1.0 and 1.7*106ha of algal and
   terrestrial dedicated feedstock production, respectively. A land
   competition index applied to these 110 counties suggests that 38 to 59
   counties could experience competition for upwards of 40% of a county's
   pastureland, representing 2%-5% of total pastureland in the U.S.;
   therefore suggesting little overall competition between algae
   production, terrestrial energy feedstocks and alternative uses for
   existing agricultural production such as livestock grazing.

AB Microalgae are emerging as a promising solution to address a number of
   markets including pharmaceutics, food, feedstock, green chemistry and
   bioenergy. However, competition within this sector requires significant
   improvement on the environmental and economic aspects. One of the
   crucial challenges is to minimize production costs, mainly by reducing
   the use of exogenous energy, both in the culture and downstream
   processes. The aim of the Purple Sun project funded by the French
   National Research Agency is to explore a breakthrough concept of
   Microalgal Photovoltaic Greenhouses (MPG). The proposed MPG design will
   be an intermediate solution between the high cost-high yield
   photobioreactors and the low costNDASHlow yield open raceways, thus
   cumulating the advantages of each system i.e. high yieldNDASHlow cost.
   The main objective is to use the entire solar spectrum to concomitantly
   produce electricity and algal biomass with high lipid content. Indeed,
   an excess of solar irradiation is damageable to microalgae. It induces
   photosaturation and photoinhibition, synthesis of photoprotective
   pigments, and leads to a counterproductive increase in medium
   temperature. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the Wysips PV
   film (initially developed for digital devices like smartphones,
   tablets...), developed by Sunpartner which became the "Nobel
   Sustainability Supported Clean Tech Company 2013" in February of that
   year, was an efficient, promising way to redirect excess solar energy to
   photovoltaic (PV) electricity without affecting biomass productivity.
   Furthermore, it was demonstrated that at high light it helps to reduce
   cell mortality. The key point is that some photons in the visible light
   spectrum are more efficient for photosynthesis - especially for the red
   and blue wavelengths, while others are used with a lower yield. Purple
   Sun is not only aiming at initiating the next generation of PV films
   dedicated to MPG but also the plant species for photovoltaic greenhouse
   applications.

AB The use of phytohormones in microalgal biofuel production is gaining
   interest due to their substantial effect on biomass and lipid enrichment
   under standard and nitrogen-limited conditions. In the present study,
   the collaborative effect of combination of selected phytohormones viz.
   zeatin (Z), indole acetic acid (IAA), and gibberellic acid (GA) was
   studied to optimize biomass and lipid production in microalga
   Acutodesmus obliquus under nitrogen-limitation using response surface
   methodology (RSM). Significantly higher biomass and lipid productivity
   was obtained with the supplementation of combination of Z (0.5 mg L-1),
   IAA (1.0 mg L-1), and GA (5.0 mg L-1) under nitrogen-limitation with
   49.07% and 77.20% increase respectively as compared to optimized
   nitrogen control (ON). Zeatin was found to be the most significantly
   influencing phytohormone followed by GA in RSM data analysis. Present
   study elucidated the synergistic effect of combination of exogenous
   phytohormones in enhancing biomass and lipid productivity under
   nitrogen-limitation for microalgal biofuel production.

AB In this study, the biochemical response of Phaeodactylum tricornutum to
   varying concentrations of inorganic selenium (Se) was investigated. It
   was observed that, when combined with fulvic acid, P. tricornutum
   exhibited enhanced uptake and biotransformation of inorganic Se, as well
   as increased microalgal lipid biosynthesis. Notably, when subjected to
   moderate (5 and 10 mg/L) and high (20 and 40 mg/L) concentrations of
   selenite under fulvic acid treatment, there was a discernible
   redirection of carbon flux towards lipogenesis and protein biosynthesis
   from carbohydrates. In addition, the key parameters of microalgae-based
   biofuels aligned with the necessary criteria outlined in biofuel
   regulations. Furthermore, the Se removal capabilities of P. tricornutum,
   assisted by fulvic acid, were coupled with the accumulation of
   substantial amounts of organic Se, specifically SeCys. These findings
   present a viable and successful approach to establish a microalgae-based
   system for Se uptake and biotransformation.

AB The denitrification of bio-oil remains an important challenge in bio-oil
   quality upgrading. Microalgae (MA) and sweet potato waste (SPW) were
   co-liquefied to investigate the denitrification of Mannich reaction. The
   influence of interaction reaction between MA and SPW on products
   qualities was explored. The results showed that the N contents of
   bio-oils from co-liquefaction (4.44-7.19%) were lower than that from
   microalgae (7.60%). Besides, the ester contents from MA&SPW
   (60.31-73.17%) were higher than that from MA (56.11%) and SPW (17.55%).
   The addition of SPW decreased the lubricating oil and fuel oil content.
   The experimental energy recovery efficiency (66.82-70.16%) was higher
   than the calculated energy recovery efficiency (65.68-66.69%) during
   co-liquefaction processes. Based on chemical compositions of products, a
   possible reaction pathway of Mannich reaction during co-liquefaction
   process was proposed. The current study suggested that co-liquefaction
   of microalgae and sweet potato waste was a feasibility way to improve
   the bio-oil quality and energy recovery efficiency.

AB The cement industry generates a substantial amount of gaseous pollutants
   that cannot be treated efficiently and economically using standard
   techniques. Microalgae, a promising bioremediation and biodegradation
   agent used as feedstock for biofuel production, can be used for the
   biotreatment of cement flue gas. In specific, components of cement flue
   gas such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur oxides are shown to
   serve as nutrients for microalgae. Microalgae also have the capacity to
   sequestrate heavy metals present in cement kiln dust, adding further
   benefits. This work provides an extensive overview of multiple
   approaches taken in the inclusion of microalgae biofuel production in
   the cement sector. In addition, factors influencing the production of
   microalgal biomass are also described in such an integrated plant. In
   addition, process limitations such as the adverse impact of flue gas on
   medium pH, exhaust gas toxicity, and efficient delivery of carbon
   dioxide to media are also discussed. Finally, the article concludes by
   proposing the future potential for incorporating the microalgae biofuel
   plant into the cement sector.

AB Photosynthetic microalgae have a high potential for the production of
   biofuels and highly valued metabolites. However, their current
   industrial exploitation is limited by a productivity in photobioreactors
   that is low compared to potential productivity. The high cell density
   and pigment content of the surface layers of photosynthetic microalgae
   result in absorption of excess photons and energy dissipation through
   non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). NPQ prevents photoinhibition, but its
   activation reduces the efficiency of photosynthetic energy conversion.
   InChlamydomonas reinhardtii, NPQ is catalyzed by protein subunits
   encoded by threelhcsr(light harvesting complex stress related) genes.
   Here, we show that heat dissipation and biomass productivity depends on
   LHCSR protein accumulation. Indeed, algal strains lacking twolhcsrgenes
   can grow in a wide range of light growth conditions without suffering
   from photoinhibition and are more productive than wild-type. Thus, the
   down-regulation of NPQ appears to be a suitable strategy for improving
   light use efficiency for biomass and biofuel production in microalgae.

AB Microalgae can be used as a source of alternative food, animal feed,
   biofuel, fertilizer, cosmetics, nutraceuticals and for pharmaceutical
   purposes. The extraction of organic constituents from microalgae
   cultivated in the different nutrient compositions is influenced by
   microalgal growth rates, biomass yield and nutritional content in terms
   of lipid and fatty acid production. In this context, nutrient
   composition plays an important role in microalgae cultivation, and
   depletion and excessive sources of this nutrient might affect the
   quality of biomass. Investigation on the role of nitrogen and
   phosphorus, which are crucial for the growth of algae, has been
   addressed. However, there are challenges for enhancing nutrient
   utilization efficiently for large scale microalgae cultivation. Hence,
   this study aims to highlight the level of nitrogen and phosphorus
   required for microalgae cultivation and focuses on the benefits of
   nitrogen and phosphorus for increasing biomass productivity of
   microalgae for improved lipid and fatty acid quantities. Furthermore,
   the suitable extraction methods that can be used to utilize lipid and
   fatty acids from microalgae for biofuel have also been reviewed.

AB Lipids and carbohydrates are main energy storage compounds (ESC) of
   microalgae under stressed conditions and they are potential feedstock
   for biofuel production. Yet, the sustainable and commercially successful
   production of ESC in microalgae needs to consider nitrogen utilization
   efficiency. Here the impact of different initial cell densities (ICDs)
   on ESC accumulation in Isochrysis zhangjiangensis under two nitrogen
   supply modes (an initially equal concentration of nitrogen per-cell in
   the medium (N1) and an equal total concentration of nitrogen in the
   culture system (N2)) were investigated. The results demonstrated that
   the highest ESC yield (1.36 g L-1) at N1, which included a maximal
   nitrogen supply in the cultivation system, and the highest ESC content
   (66.5%) and ESC productivity per mass of nitrogen (3.28 g g-1 (N) day-1)
   at N2, were all obtained under a high ICD of 8.0*106 cells mL-1.
   Therefore I. zhangjiangensis qualifies for ESC-enriched biomass
   production with economized nitrogen utilization.

AB Microalgae lipids have attracted great attention in the world as a
   result of their potential use for biodiesel productions. Microalgae are
   cultivated in photoautotrophic conditions in most cases, but several
   species are able to grow under heterotrophic conditions, in which
   microalgae are cultivated in the dark where the cell growth and
   reproduction are supported by organic carbons. This perspective is
   covering the related studies concerning the difference between hetero-
   and autotrophic cultivation of microalgae. The auto- and heterotrophic
   central carbon metabolic pathways in microalgae are described, and the
   catalyzing reactions of several key metabolic enzymes and their
   corresponding changes in the protein level are summarized. Under adverse
   environmental conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, microalgae have
   the ability to highly store energy by forming triacylglycerol (TAG), the
   reason for which is analyzed. In addition, the biosynthesis of fatty
   acids and TAGs and their difference between auto- and heterotrophic
   conditions are compared at the molecular level. The positive regulatory
   enzymes, such as glucose transporter protein, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
   aldolase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the negative
   regulation enzymes, such as triose phosphate isomerase, played a crucial
   role in the lipid accumulation auto- and heterotrophic conditions.

AB As reported in the study, the high-oil/ha-year productivity of
   microalgae has raised a lot of interest in their use as a source of raw
   materials for biofuels. However, the high costs of production and
   maintenance of closed culture systems (photobioreactor type) and the
   problems of contamination that lead to lower productivity of open
   systems (of the "open-pond" type) have become important limitations in
   evaluating the sustainability of producing biofuels from microalgae. In
   the view of the favorable prospects of employing microalgae as an
   economically viable source of raw materials for the production of
   biofuels, this chapter outlines the different ways microalgae are
   cultivated, the required nutritional conditions and the main procedures
   used for increasing their scale. Additionally, those more commonly used
   on a large scale are described and their advantages and disadvantages
   are pointed out. This analysis results in a proposal of a new type of
   photobioreactor, of the cylindrical container type, constructed of
   polyethylene, a nontransparent material that is cheaper and more durable
   than the ones that are commonly used (polycarbonate, glass or polymethyl
   methacrylate (PMMA)). Internal illumination of the photobioreactor is
   provided by a beam from plastic optical fibers that receive sunlight
   focused at the extremity of the beam.

AB The scarcity of natural fossil fuels presents a promising opportunity
   for the development of renewable microalgae-based biofuels. However, the
   current microalgae cultivation is unable to effectively address the high
   costs of the production of biofuels. To tackle this challenge, this
   study focused on recruiting engineeredPhaeodactylum tricornutum(FabG-OE)
   to enhance biomass accumulation and lipid production by employing food
   waste hydrolysate under temperature variations. The biomass and lipid
   accumulations of FabG-OE were improved effectively in mixed culture
   medium and food waste hydrolysate at a volume ratio (v/v) of 80:20 at
   30°C. It was found that oxidative stress might contribute to the
   overexpression of lipogenic genes, thereby leading to lipogenesis at
   30°C. Upscaling cultivation of FabG-OE at 30°C using a semi-continuous
   strategy and batch strategy was conducted to achieve 0.73 and 0.77 g/L/d
   of biomass containing 0.35 and 0.38 g/L/d of lipid, respectively. In
   summary, these findings provide valuable insights for advancing
   microalgae-based biofuel production.

AB Due to the depletion of fossil fuel resources and concern about
   increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, the production of microbial oil as
   source for energy and chemicals is considered as a sustainable
   alternative. A promising candidate strain for the production of
   microbial oil is the oleaginous yeast Schwanniomyces occidentalis CBS
   2864. To compete with fossil resources, cultivation and processing of S.
   occidentalis requires improvement. Currently, different cell wall
   disruption techniques based on mechanical, chemical, physiological, and
   biological methods are being investigated using a variety of oil
   producing yeasts and microalgae. Most of these techniques are not
   suitable for upscaling because they are technically or energetically
   unfavorable. Therefore, new techniques have to be developed to overcome
   this challenge. Here, we demonstrate an effective mild enzymatic
   approach for cell disruption to facilitate lipid extraction from the
   oleaginous yeast S. occidentalis. Most oil was released by applying 187
   mg L1 tailor-made enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum CBS 146429 against
   the yeast cell wall of S. occidentalis at pH 5.0 and 40°C with 4 h of
   incubation time after applying 1 M NaOH as a pretreatment step.

AB Microalgae exhibit enormous diversity and can potentially contribute to
   the production of biofuels and high value compounds. However, for most
   species, our knowledge of their physiology, metabolism, and gene
   regulation is fairly limited. In eukaryotes, gene silencing mechanisms
   play important roles in both the reversible repression of genes that are
   required only in certain contexts and the suppression of genome invaders
   such at transposons. The recent sequencing of several algal genomes is
   providing insights into the complexity of these mechanisms in
   microalgae. Collectively, glaucophyte, red, and green microalgae contain
   the machineries involved in repressive histone H3 lysine methylation,
   DNA cytosine methylation, and RNA interference. However, individual
   species often only have subsets of these gene silencing mechanisms.
   Moreover, current evidence suggests that algal silencing systems
   function in transposon and transgene repression but their role(s) in
   gene regulation or other cellular processes remains virtually
   unexplored, hindering rational genetic engineering efforts.

AB The circadian clock schedules processes in microalgae cells at suitable
   times in the day/night cycle. To gain knowledge about these biological
   time schedules,Neochloris oleoabundanswas grown under constant light
   conditions and nitrogen limitation. Under these constant conditions, the
   only variable was the circadian clock. The results were compared to
   previous work done under nitrogen-replete conditions, in order to
   determine the effect of N-limitation on circadian rhythms in the cell
   cycle and biomass composition ofN. oleoabundans. The circadian clock was
   not affected by nitrogen-limitation, and cell division was timed in the
   natural night, despite of constant light conditions. However, because of
   nitrogen-limitation, not the entire population was able to divide every
   day. Two subpopulations were observed, which divided alternately every
   other day. This caused oscillations in biomass yield and composition.
   Starch and total fatty acids (TFA) were accumulated during the day.
   Also, fatty acid composition changed during the cell cycle. Neutral
   lipids were built up during the day, especially in cells that were
   arrested in their cell cycle (G2 and G3). These findings give insight in
   the influence of circadian rhythms on the cell cycle and biomass
   composition.

AB The wide range of microalgae applications has increased in the last
   decade, due to their importance as the source of biofuel and biomass.
   The potential of wastewater as a culture media lies in the presence of
   high contents of nutrients and elements required to improve the growth
   of microalgae and, thus, the high quantity of biomass. However, these
   properties might be the limitations in the harvesting of microalgae
   biomass from wastewater. This review discussed the potential of
   wastewater as the production media for biomass and focused on the
   harvesting methods, because it represented a major challenge in the
   quality and quantity of microalgal cells. It can be concluded that among
   several technologies used for harvesting microalgae biomass from
   wastewater, the natural flocculant method was the most efficient due to
   the absence of toxic by-products and secondary effects on the quality of
   biomass yield, as well as the high biomass quantity.

AB The excessive emission of flue gas contributes to air pollution,
   abnormal climate change, global warming, and sea level rises associated
   with glacial melting. With the ability to utilize NOx as a nitrogen
   source and to convert solar energy into chemical energy via CO2
   fixation, microalgae can potentially reduce air pollution and relax
   global warming, while also enhancing biomass and biofuel production as
   well as the production of high-value-added products. This
   informatics-based review analyzes the trends in the related literature
   and in patent activity to draw conclusions and to offer a prospective
   view on the developments of microalgae for industrial flue gas
   biosequestration. It is revealed that in recent years, microalgal
   research for industrial flue gas biosequestration has started to attract
   increasing attention and has now developed into a hot research topic,
   although it is still at a relatively early stage, and needs more
   financial and policy support in order to better understand microalgae
   and to develop an economically viable process. In comparison with onsite
   microalgal CO2 capture, microalgae-based biological DeNOx appears to be
   a more realistic and attractive alternative that could be applied to NOx
   treatment.

AB Because of their high lipid content, microalgae are regarded as a
   potentially competitive source for biofuels. However, one of the main
   biotechnological challenges in algae-based biofuels is that cell
   division is arrested under conditions which promote lipid accumulation,
   resulting in reduced overall lipid yield. In this study,
   sethoxydim-resistant mutants of the promising thermotolerant green
   microalga Micractinium sp., which has a relatively fast growth rate and
   tolerance to outdoor high temperatures, were generated by UV-C
   mutagenesis for increased cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) without
   compromising on growth rate. Two Micractinium mutants were isolated
   (designated as Mut 3 and Mut 4) that displayed significant increase in
   TAG cell content up to 71% and 84%, with decreased chlorophyll content
   by 37% and 38%, respectively, compared with the wild-type cells. Final
   TAG culture productivity of Mut 3 and Mut 4 were also greater, reaching
   up to 0.61  0.01 and 0.62  0.02 g L-1, respectively, compared with the
   wild-type culture of 0.40  0.03 g L-1. The mutants were stable without
   using antibiotics or any other chemicals during the experiments and
   preservation. These results highly nominate the mutants of Micractinium
   sp. isolated in this work as potential microalgae candidates to serve as
   a feedstock for sustainable and cost-effective biofuel production.

AB Background: Hydrogen photoproduction from green microalgae is regarded
   as a promising alternative solution for energy problems. However, the
   simultaneous oxygen evolution from microalgae can prevent continuous
   hydrogen production due to the hypersensitivity of hydrogenases to
   oxygen. Sulfur deprivation can extend the duration of algal hydrogen
   production, but it is uneconomical to alternately culture algal cells in
   sulfur-sufficient and sulfur-deprived media. Results: In this study, we
   developed a novel way to simulate sulfur-deprivation treatment while
   constantly maintaining microalgal cells in sulfur-sufficient culture
   medium by overexpressing an endogenous microRNA (miR1166.1). Based on
   our previous RNA-seq analysis in the model green algaChlamydomonas
   reinhardtii, three endogenous miRNAs responsive to sulfur deprivation
   (cre-miR1166.1, cre-miR1150.3, and cre-miR1158) were selected.
   Heat-inducible expression vectors containing the selected miRNAs were
   constructed and transformed intoC. reinhardtii. Comparison of
   H2production following heat induction in the three transgenic strains
   and untransformed control group identified miR1166.1 as the best
   candidate for H2production regulation. Moreover, enhanced
   photobio-H2production was observed with repeated induction of miR1166.1
   expression. Conclusions: This study is the first to identify a
   physiological function of endogenous miR1166.1 and to show that a
   natural miRNA can regulate hydrogen photoproduction in the unicellular
   model organismC. reinhardtii.

   treatment efficiency of 90%. Nitrates removal efficiency of 25% was
   observed in SBR, 31% in BET and 44% in microalgae, with a total
   efficiency of 72%. The SBR treated effluents fed to BET with the
   electrode intervention showed TDS removal. BET exhibited relatively
   higher process performance than SBR. The integration approach
   significantly overcame the individual process limitations along with
   value addition as biomass (1.75 g/L), carbohydrates (640 mg/g), lipids
   (15%) and bioelectricity. The study resulted in providing a strategy of
   combining SBR as pretreatment step to BET process and finally polishing
   with microalgae cultivation achieving the benefits of enhanced
   wastewater treatment along with value addition.

AB Cell disruption is an essential pre-treatment for the efficient
   extraction of many types of intracellular metabolites such as proteins,
   carbohydrates, DNAs or lipids; but the high process energy requirement
   becomes an important issue for low valued commodities such as biofuels.
   Current mechanical cell disruption methods such as high-pressure
   homogeniser or sonication require energy input in the order of hundreds
   of MJ kg-1 of the dry mass; in addition, these methods do not have the
   capacity suitable for biofuel production where daily processing volumes
   are in order of mega litres. This study investigated hydrodynamic
   cavitation (HC) as a cell disruption technique, with levels of
   disruption determined by (i) lipids extracted and (ii) the chlorophyll
   released. It was found that for the lipid extraction, HC has a
   disruption energy requirement of 3 MJ kg-1. This amount of energy
   requirement is more efficient than sonication by a factor of 10;
   however, it still represents nearly 13% of the total energy in the
   biomass and is too high for the production of biofuels. The cell
   disruption by HC is essentially periplasmic, i.e. mainly confined to the
   cell wall and membrane. This result suggests that damage to the outer
   cell barrier such as the cell wall was sufficient to allow for the
   diffusion of solvents for lipid extraction.

AB Background: Microalgae are emerging as suitable feedstock for renewable
   biofuel production and providing a promising way to alleviate green
   house gas CO2. Characterizing the metabolic pathways involved in the
   biosynthesis of energy-rich compounds and their global regulation upon
   elevated CO2is necessary to explore the mechanism underlying rapid
   growth and lipid accumulation, so as to realize the full potential of
   these organisms as energy resources. Results: In the present study, 2
   and 5% CO2increased growth rate and lipid accumulation in
   autotrophically cultured green algaCoccomyxa subellipsoideaC-169.
   Overall biomass productivity as 222 mg L-1day-1and fatty acid content as
   48.5% dry cell weight were attained in 2% CO2, suggesting C-169 as a
   great candidate for lipid production via CO2supplementation.
   Transcriptomic analysis of 2% against 0.04% CO2-cultured C-169 unveiled
   the global regulation of important metabolic processes. Other than
   enhancing gene expression in the Calvin cycle, C-169 upregulated the
   expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase and
   carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II to enhance the anaplerotic carbon
   assimilation reactions upon elevated CO2. Upregulation of ferredoxin and
   ferredoxin-NADP+reductase implied that plentiful energy captured through
   photosynthesis was transferred through ferredoxin to sustain rapid
   growth and lipid accumulation. Genes involved in the glycolysis, TCA
   cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were predominantly upregulated
   presumably to provide abundant intermediates and metabolic energy for
   anabolism. Coordinated upregulation of nitrogen acquisition and
   assimilation genes, together with activation of specific
   carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase and ornithine pathway genes, might help
   C-169 to maintain carbon/nitrogen balance upon elevated CO2. Significant
   downregulation of fatty acid degradation genes, as well as the
   upregulation of fatty acid synthesis genes at the later stage might
   contribute to the tremendous lipid accumulation. Conclusion: Global and
   collaborative regulation was employed by C-169 to assimilate more carbon
   and maintain carbon/nitrogen balance upon elevated CO2, which provide
   abundant carbon skeleton and affluent metabolic energy to sustain rapid
   growth and lipid accumulation. Data here for the first time bring
   significant insights into the regulatory profile of metabolism and
   acclimation to elevated CO2in C-169, which provide important information
   for future metabolic engineering in the development of sustainable
   microalgae-based biofuels.

   wastewater treatment technologies, to reduce the pressure on the
   environment caused by resource shortages. Recently, a
   microalgal-bacterial granular sludge (MBGS) technology has attracted
   widespread attention due to its high efficiency wastewater treatment
   capacity, low energy consumption, low CO2emissions, potentially high
   added values, and resource recovery capabilities. This review focused
   primarily on the following aspects of microalgal-bacterial granular
   sludge technology: (1) MBGS culture and maintenance operating
   parameters, (2) MBGS application in different wastewaters, (3) MBGS
   additional products: biofuels and bioproducts, (4) MBGS energy saving
   and consumption reduction: greenhouse gas emission reduction, and (5)
   challenges and prospects. The information in this review will help us
   better understand the current progress and future direction of the MBGS
   technology development. It is expected that this review will provide a
   sound theoretical basis for the practical applications of a MBGS
   technology in environmentally sustainable wastewater treatment, resource
   recovery, and system optimization.

AB In this work, we studied a novel algae cultivation strategy, mixotrophic
   microalgae biofilm, to improve the productivity and cost-efficiency of
   algal biofuel production. In contrast to previous methods, this improved
   approach can achieve high productivity at low cost by harnessing the
   benefits of mixotrophic growth's high efficiency, i.e., capable of
   subsisting on inorganic and organic carbons thus unaffected by limited
   light, and microalgae biofilm's low harvesting cost. Our results, as one
   of the first studies of this type, proved that microalgae biofilms under
   mixotrophic condition exhibited significantly higher productivity and
   quality of biofuel feedstock: 2-3 times higher of biomass yield, 2-10
   times higher of lipid accumulation, and 40-60% lower of ash content when
   compared to microalgae biofilms under autotrophic condition. In
   addition, we investigated the impact of cell-surface properties
   (hydrophobicity and roughness) on the growth activities of microalgae
   biofilms and found that the productivity of mixotrophic biofilms was
   significantly correlated with the surface hydrophobicity. Finally, our
   work demonstrated the applicability of integrating this novel
   cultivation method with wastewater for maximum efficiency. This study
   opens a new possibility to solve the long-lasting challenges of algal
   biofuel feedstock production, i.e., low productivity and high cost of
   algal cultivation.

AB Biofuels production from microalgae attracts much attention but remains
   an unproven technology. We explore routes to enhance production through
   modifications to a range of generic microalgal physiological
   characteristics. Our analysis shows that biofuels production may be
   enhancedcafivefold through genetic modification (GM) of factors
   affecting growth rate, respiration, photoacclimation, photosynthesis
   efficiency and the minimum cell quotas for nitrogen and phosphorous (N:C
   and P:C). However, simulations indicate that the ideal GM microalgae for
   commercial deployment could, on escape to the environment, become a
   harmful algal bloom species par excellence, with attendant risks to
   ecosystems and livelihoods. In large measure, this is because an
   organism able to produce carbohydrate and/or lipid at high rates,
   providing stock metabolites for biofuels production, will also be able
   to attain a stoichiometric composition that will be far from optimal as
   food for the support of zooplankton growth. This composition could
   suppress or even halt the grazing activity that would otherwise control
   the microalgal growth in nature. In consequence, we recommend that the
   genetic manipulation of microalgae, with inherent consequences on a
   scale comparable to geoengineering, should be considered under strict
   international regulation.

AB Microalgae have great potential for the production of biofuels due to
   the ability of the organism to accumulate large quantities of storage
   lipids under stress conditions. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
   signaling cascades are widely recognized for their role in stress
   response signal transduction in eukaryotes. To assess the correlation
   between MAPK activation and lipid productivity,Chlamydomonas
   reinhardtiiwas studied under various concentrations of NaCl. The results
   demonstrated thatC. reinhardtiiexhibits elevated levels of
   extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase
   (JNK) activities after undergoing osmotic stress, as well as an increase
   in cellular lipid content. To establish a more direct causal link
   between both kinases and lipid productivity,C. reinhardtiiwas subjected
   to biochemically induced regulation of ERK and JNK pathways. Activating
   the MEK-ERK pathway via C6 ceramide treatment increased ERK activation
   and lipid production simultaneously, while PD98059 mediated inhibition
   of the pathway yielded opposite results. Interestingly, suppression of
   the JNK pathway with SP600125 resulted in a substantial decrease in cell
   viability under osmotic stress. These results suggest that ERK and JNK
   MAP kinases have important roles in microalgal lipid accumulation and
   cell growth under osmotic stress, respectively.

AB To combat the limitations of commercializing microalgal-derived
   biofuels, alternative lipid extraction procedures must be employed. The
   use of enzymes for cell wall and organelle disruption and lysis are
   advantageous over traditional extraction techniques such as the
   energy-intensive process of drying and pressing. The use of autolytic
   enzymes provides an opportunity for establishing a pretreatment method
   as part of an integrated aqueous enzymatic lipid extraction process from
   microalgae. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of autolysin,
   an autolytic metalloproteinase, onChlamydomonas reinhardtiicell lysis
   and enhanced lipid extraction in comparison to traditional disruption
   techniques. Increased temperature and controlled mixing were utilized as
   augmenting factors to improve the pretreatment of microalgae cells. The
   extent of cell lysis was measured by direct cell count and visualized
   using electron microscopy. Furthermore, recoverable lipids before and
   after autolysin treatment were determined by subsequent solvent
   extraction. Autolysin treatment at room temperature and constant mixing
   was capable of lysing over 50% of cells which could be increased to over
   80% by increasing the incubation temperature. Pretreatment with
   autolysin significantly increased lipid yield as quantified by solvent
   extraction. Results indicate that autolysin combined with controlled
   mixing and incubation temperatures can enhance cell lysis and facilitate
   improved lipid extraction with subsequent secondary treatments. The
   pretreatment established represents a novel application of autolysin in
   catalyzing whole cell lysis beyond previous cell transformation
   applications of this enzyme.

AB High water demand is a major challenge for the algae industry, so
   cultivating algae in wastewater can have the double benefit of biomass
   production and water remediation. The use of landfill leachate (LL),
   which is wastewater generated in landfills, was investigated to grow the
   microalgaPicochlorum oculatumin a novel horizontal bioreactor (HBR), a
   low-cost modular cultivation system that reduces water evaporation and
   contamination risk thanks to its enclosed design. Pilot-scale (150 L)
   and commercial-scale (2000 L) HBRs that were operated outdoors in
   Florida using LL in batch and semi-continuous modes generated high cell
   density cultures (1.7.109cells mL-1) and reached up to 1.9 g L-1of dry
   biomass suitable for biofuel production. Demonstrating the ability of
   ample non-potable water sources, such as LL, to support algae
   cultivation is essential for improving the sustainability and
   cost-effectiveness of commercial algal biofuels and bioproducts, as
   freshwater resources become increasingly scarce.

   microalgae Parachlorella kessleri.
SO Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology. B, Biology
VL 199
PY 2019
U1 0
U2 30
AB The green microalgae Parachlorella kessleri RA-002 isolated in Armenia
   can produce biohydrogen (H2) during oxygenic photosynthesis. Addition of
   protonophores, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and
   2,4-dinitrophenol (DNF) enhances H2 yield in P. kessleri. The maximal H2
   yield of ~2.20 and 2.08 mmol L-1 was obtained in the presence of 15 muM
   CCCP and 50 muM DNF, respectively. During dark conditions H2 production
   by P. kessleri was not observed even in the presence of protonophores,
   indicating that H2 formation in these algae was mediated by light
   conditions. The enhancing effect of protonophores can be coupled with
   dissipation of proton motive force across thylakoid membrane in P.
   kessleri, facilitating the availability of protons and electrons to
   [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase, which led to formation of H2. At the same time H2
   production was not observed in the presence of diuron
   (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), a specific inhibitor of PS
   II. Moreover, diuron inhibits H2 yield in P. kessleri in the presence of
   protonophores. The inhibitory effect of diuron coupled with suppression
   of electron transfer from PS II. The results showed that in these algae
   operates PS II-dependent pathway of H2 generation. This study is
   important for understanding of the mechanisms of H2 production by green
   microalgae P. kessleri and developing of its biotechnology.

PS 306-315

U1 2
U2 97
AB It is widely established that nutritional nitrogen deprivation increases
   lipid accumulation but severely decreases growth rate in microalgae. To
   understand the regulatory branch points that determine the partitioning
   of carbon among its potential sinks, we analyzed metabolite and
   transcript levels of central carbon metabolic pathways and determined
   the average fluxes and quantum requirements for the synthesis of
   protein, carbohydrates and fatty acid in the diatom Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum. Under nitrate-starved conditions, the carbon fluxes into
   all major sinks decrease sharply; the largest decrease was into proteins
   and smallest was into lipids. This reduction of carbon flux into lipids
   together with a significantly lower growth rate is responsible for lower
   overall FA productivities implying that nitrogen starvation is not a
   bioenergetically feasible strategy for increasing biodiesel production.
   The reduction in these fluxes was accompanied by an 18-fold increase in
   alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), 3-fold increase in NADPH/NADP+, and sharp
   decreases in glutamate (GLU) and glutamine (GLN) levels. Additionally,
   the mRNA level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and two type II
   diacylglycerol-acyltransferases were increased. Partial suppression of
   nitrate reductase by tungstate resulted in similar trends at lower
   levels as for nitrate starvation. These results reveal that the GS/GOGAT
   pathway is the main regulation site for nitrate dependent control of
   carbon partitioning between protein and lipid biosynthesis, while the
   AKG/GL(N/U) metabolite ratio is a transcriptional signal, possibly
   related to redox poise of intermediates in the photosynthetic electron
   transport system.

AB Background: Nitrogen limitation can induce neutral lipid accumulation in
   microalgae, as well as inhibiting their growth. Therefore, to obtain
   cultures with both high biomass and high lipid contents, and explore the
   lipid accumulation mechanisms, we implemented nitrogen deprivation in a
   model diatomPhaeodactylum tricornutumat late exponential phase. Results:
   Neutral lipid contents per cell subsequently increased 2.4-fold, both
   the number and total volume of oil bodies increased markedly, and cell
   density rose slightly. Transcriptional profile analyzed by RNA-Seq
   showed that expression levels of 1213 genes (including key carbon
   fixation, TCA cycle, glycerolipid metabolism and nitrogen assimilation
   genes) increased, with a false discovery rate cut-off of 0.001, under N
   deprivation. However, most light harvesting complex genes were
   down-regulated, extensive degradation of chloroplast membranes was
   observed under an electron microscope, and photosynthetic efficiency
   declined. Further identification of lipid classes showed that levels of
   MGDG and DGDG, the main lipid components of chloroplast membranes,
   dramatically decreased and triacylglycerol (TAG) levels significantly
   rose, indicating that intracellular membrane remodeling substantially
   contributed to the neutral lipid accumulation. Conclusions: Our findings
   shed light on the molecular mechanisms of neutral lipid accumulation and
   the key genes involved in lipid metabolism in diatoms. They also provide
   indications of possible strategies for improving microalgal biodiesel
   production.

AB The marine species microalgae are an attractive source of feedstock for
   biofuel production and other bio-products such as omega-3 fatty acids
   and aquaculture feeds. The prevailing main nutrients in seawater
   environment for their growth are believed to be more economical than
   freshwater in terms of their cultivation system which may lead to low
   cost for upstream processing. Hence, marine microalgae provide
   attractive potential to be further explored. However, harvesting process
   of microalgae is known to be too costly because of their dilute nature
   that accounts for 20-30% of the overall production costs rendering using
   microalgae as the raw material not economically feasible. Currently the
   various harvesting methods including centrifugation, flocculation,
   flotation, filtration and magnetic separation had been applied to
   harvest marine species. For instance, harvesting by electrolytic means
   that require less energy to harvest marine species compared to the
   freshwater species. This can potentially help to reduce the challenges
   related to the exploitation of microalgae biomass. However, different
   techniques have their own advantages and drawbacks, whereas their cost
   and energy requirement vary accordingly depending on the selection of
   marine microalgal strains, equipment used and/or the choice of
   harvesting aid (flocculants, surfactant). Thus far, no single technique
   may still be proposed. Therefore, this paper aims to provide further
   details of each method used focusing only for marine species of
   microalgae with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

AB Optimization of the production rate of biomass rich in N (e.g. for
   protein) or C (e.g. for biofuels) is key to making algae-based
   technology commercially viable. Creating the appropriate conditions to
   achieve this is a challenge; operational permutations are extensive,
   while geographical variations localise effective methods of cultivation
   when utilising natural illumination. As an aid to identifying suitable
   operational envelopes, a mechanistic acclimative model of microalgae
   growth is used for the first time to simulate production in virtual
   systems over a broad latitudinal range. Optimization of production is
   achieved through selection of strain characteristics, system optical
   depth, nutrient supply, and dilution regimes for different geographic
   and seasonal illumination profiles. Results reveal contrasting
   requirements for optimising biomass vs biofuels production. Trade-offs
   between maximising areal and volumetric production while conserving
   resources, plus hydrodynamic limits on reactor design, lead to
   quantifiable constraints for optimal operational permutations.
   Simulations show how selection of strains with a high maximum growth
   rate, Um, remains the prime factor enabling high productivity. Use of an
   f/2 growth medium with a culture dilution rate set at 25% of Um delivers
   sufficient nutrition for optimal biomass production. Further,
   sensitivity to the balance between areal and volumetric productivity
   leads to a well-defined critical depth at 0.1 m at which areal biofuel
   production peaks with use of a low concentration f/4 growth medium
   combined with a dilution rate 15% of Um. Such analyses, and developments
   thereof, will aid in developing a decision support tool to enable more
   productive methods of cultivation.

AB Microalgae can produce and contain lipids, proteins and carbohydrates,
   which can be extracted and marketed as potential novel added-value
   bio-products. However, microalgae cell wall disruption is one of the
   most important challenges involved while processing this type of
   biomass. In this context, white-rot fungi, responsible for the
   biodegradation of lignin present in wood due to non-specific
   extracellular enzymes, could be applied for promoting microalgae cell
   wall degradation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
   use of an enzymatic extract produced by the white-rot
   fungiAnthracophyllum discoloras a biotechnological tool forBotryococcus
   brauniicell wall disruption. The fungus was inoculated in wheat grains
   and manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity was monitored while obtaining
   the enzymatic extract. Then, cell wall disruption trials with different
   MnP activity were evaluated by the biochemical methane potential (BMP).
   In relation to cell wall disruption, it was observed that the optimal
   value was obtained with enzymatic concentration of 1000 U/L with a BMP
   of 521 mL CH4/g VS. Under these conditions almost 90% of biomass
   biodegradability was observed, increasing in 62% compared to the
   microalgae without treatment. Therefore, the results indicate that
   enzymes secreted byA. discolorpromoted the attack of the different cell
   wall components finally weakening it. Therefore, the application of this
   treatment could be a promissory biotechnological approach to decrease
   the energetic input required for the cell wall disruption step.

AB Background: Nutrient limitation, such as nitrogen depletion, is the most
   widely used method for improving microalgae fatty acid production;
   however, these harsh conditions also inhibit algal growth significantly
   and even kill cells at all. To avoid these problems, we used artificial
   microRNA (amiRNA) technology as a useful tool to manipulate metabolic
   pathways to increase fatty acid contents effectively in the green
   microalgaChlamydomonas reinhardtii. We down-regulated the expression of
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), which catalyzes the formation of
   oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate and regulates carbon flux.
   Results: amiRNAs against twoCrPEPCgenes were designed and transformed
   intoChlamydomonascells and amiRNAs were induced by heat shock treatment.
   The transcription levels of amiRNAs increased 16-28 times, resulting in
   the remarkable decreases of the expression ofCrPEPCs. In the end,
   inhibiting the expression of theCrPEPCgenes dramatically increased the
   total fatty acid content in the transgenic algae by 28.7-48.6%, which
   mostly increased the content of C16-C22 fatty acids. Furthermore, the
   highest content was that of C18:3n3 with an average increase of 35.75%,
   while C20-C22 fatty acid content significantly increased by 85-160%.
   Conclusions: Overall our results suggest that heat shock treatment
   induced the expression of amiRNAs, which can effectively down-regulate
   the expression ofCrPEPCsinC. reinhardtii, resulting in an increase of
   fatty acid synthesis with the most significant increase occurring for
   C16 to C22 fatty acids.

AB The biomass productivity ofScenedesmus obliquuswas investigated outdoors
   during all seasons in solar tracked flat panel photobioreactors (PBR) to
   evaluate key parameters for process optimization. CO2was supplied by
   flue gas from an attached combined block heat and power plant. Waste
   heat from the power plant was used to heat the culture during winter.
   The parameters pH, CO2, and inorganic salt concentrations were
   automatically adjusted to nonlimiting levels. The optimum biomass
   concentration increased directly with the photosynthetic active
   radiation (PAR) from 3 to 5 g dry weight (DW)L-1for a low PAR of 10 mol
   photons m-2day-1and high PAR of 40-60 mol photons m-2day-1,
   respectively. The annual average biomass yield (photosynthetic
   efficiency) was 0.40.5 g DW mol-1photons. However, biomass yields of 1.5
   g DW mol-1photons close to the theoretical maximum were obtained at low
   PAR. The productivity (including the night biomass losses) ranged during
   all seasons from -5 up to 30 g DW m-2day-1with a mean productivity of 97
   g DW m-2day-1. Low night temperatures of the culture medium and elevated
   day temperatures to the species-specific optimum increased the
   productivity. Thus, continuous regulation of the biomass concentration
   and the culture temperature with regard to the fluctuating weather
   conditions is essential for process optimization of outdoor microalgal
   production systems in temperate climates.

TI Selection and characterization of a Parachlorella kessleri microalgal
   strain able to assimilate lactose, and grow on dairy waste.
SO Biomass and Bioenergy
VL 188
PY 2024
U1 5
U2 6
AB One of the main limitations of commercial production of algae is the
   cost of cultivation, largely attributed to the cost of the nutrients;
   hence, finding cheap alternative substrates has been a significant line
   of research in this field. The dairy industry produces large amounts of
   wastewater that might be used as a cost-effective nutrient alternative,
   containing lactose as a main carbon source, as well as other essential
   nutrients like nitrogen and phosphate. Nevertheless, just a few algal
   species of commercial value can grow on any organic carbon sources, and
   even less are able to utilize lactose. In this work we have identified a
   Parachlorella kessleri strain capable of utilizing lactose for growth,
   and have characterized its ability to accumulate metabolites of
   commercial interest under heterotrophic growth conditions. P. kessleri
   was capable to utilize lactose from dairy wastewater, and to accumulate
   several amino acids, dicarboxylic acids, such as tartaric acid and
   succinic acid, and triacylglycerols in heterotrophic conditions. These
   metabolites have applications in the food, feed, and pharmaceutical
   industries, and in the green chemical industry for the production of
   bio-based green polymers and biofuels. The significance of these
   findings for future product development is discussed.

AB Background: Sulfur-deprived cultivation ofChlamydomonas reinhardtii,
   referred as "two-stage culture" transferring the cells from regular
   algal medium to sulfur-deplete one, has been extensively studied to
   improve photobio-H2production in this green microalga. During
   sulfur-deprivation treatment, the synthesis of a key component of
   photosystem II complex, D1 protein, was inhibited and improved
   photobio-H2 production could be established inC. reinhardtii. However,
   separation of algal cells from a regular liquid culture medium to a
   sulfur-deprived one is not only a discontinuous process, but also a
   cost- and time-consuming operation. More applicable and economic
   alternatives for sustained H2 production byC. reinhardtiiare still
   highly required. Results: In the present study, a significant
   improvement in photobio-H2production was observed in the transgenic
   green microalgaC. reinhardtii, which employed a newly designed strategy
   based on a heat-inducible artificial miRNA (amiRNA) expression system
   targeting D1-encoded gene,psbA. A transgenic algal strain referred as
   "amiRNA-D1" has been successfully obtained by transforming the
   expression vector containing a heat-inducible promoter. After heat shock
   conducted in the same algal cultures, the expression of amiRNA-D1 was
   detected increased 15-fold accompanied with a 73% decrease of target
   genepsbA. More interestingly, this transgenic alga accumulated about 60%
   more H2content than the wild-type strain CC-849 at the end of 7-day
   cultivation. Conclusions: The photobio-H2production in the engineered
   transgenic alga was significantly improved. Without imposing any
   nutrient-deprived stress, this novel strategy provided a convenient and
   efficient way for regulation of photobio-H2production in green microalga
   by simply "turn on" the expression of a designed amiRNA.

AB The unicellular green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtiihas become an
   invaluable model system in plant biology. There is also considerable
   interest in developing this microalga into an efficient production
   platform for biofuels, pharmaceuticals, green chemicals and industrial
   enzymes. However, the production of foreign proteins in the
   nucleocytosolic compartment ofChlamydomonasis greatly hampered by the
   inefficiency of transgene expression from the nuclear genome. We have
   recently addressed this limitation by isolating mutant algal strains
   that permit high-level transgene expression and by determining the
   contributions of GC content and codon usage to gene expression
   efficiency. Here we have applied these new tools and explored the
   potential ofChlamydomonasto produce a recombinant biopharmaceutical, the
   HIV antigen P24. We show that a codon-optimizedP24gene variant
   introduced into our algal expression strains give rise to recombinant
   protein accumulation levels of up to 0.25% of the total cellular
   protein. Moreover, in combination with an expression strain, a
   resynthesizednptIIgene becomes a highly efficient selectable marker gene
   that facilitates the selection of transgenic algal clones at high
   frequency. By establishing simple principles of successful transgene
   expression, our data open up new possibilities for biotechnological
   research inChlamydomonas.

AB The genetically tractable microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has many
   advantages as a model for renewable bioproducts and/or biofuels
   production. However, one limitation of C. reinhardtii is its relatively
   low-lipid content compared with some other algal species. To overcome
   this limitation, we combined ethane methyl sulfonate mutagenesis with
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of cells stained with the
   lipophilic stain Nile Red to isolate lipid hyperaccumulating mutants of
   C. reinhardtii. By manipulating the FACS gates, we sorted mutagenized
   cells with extremely high Nile Red fluorescence signals that were rarely
   detected in nonmutagenized populations. This strategy successfully
   isolated several putative lipid hyperaccumulating mutants exhibiting 23%
   to 58% (dry weight basis) higher fatty acid contents than their
   progenitor strains. Significantly, for most mutants, nitrogen starvation
   was not required to attain high-lipid content nor was there a
   requirement for a deficiency in starch accumulation. Microscopy of Nile
   Red stained cells revealed that some mutants exhibit an increase in the
   number of lipid bodies, which correlated with TLC analysis of
   triacyglycerol content. Increased lipid content could also arise through
   increased biomass production. Collectively, our findings highlight the
   ability to enhance intracellular lipid accumulation in algae using
   random mutagenesis in conjunction with a robust FACS and lipid yield
   verification regime. Our lipid hyperaccumulating mutants could serve as
   a genetic resource for stacking additional desirable traits to further
   increase lipid production and for identifying genes contributing to
   lipid hyperaccumulation, without lengthy lipid-induction periods.

AB Low-temperature plasma (LTP) has gained significant attention recently
   due to its unique properties and potentially wide applications in
   agriculture, medicine, and food industry. Microalgae have become
   important to human life since they provide raw materials and bioactive
   products to industries. This review especially examines how LTP
   technology can be utilized to enhance microalgae growth and production
   of various metabolites and bioactive compounds such as astaxanthin,
   biofuel, lipid, proteins, and polysaccharides through mutagenesis and/or
   stimulation. Also, this review suggests that LTP may be combined with
   multi-omics tools such as proteomics, transcriptome, metabolomics and
   advanced methods such as single-cell analysis techniques to provide a
   promising strategy for acquiring desirable strains in algal mutant
   breeding and for enhancing the production of bioactive compounds in the
   microalgae. By shedding light on the benefits and applications of LTP,
   we hope to inspire new solutions to the challenges of commercial-scale
   microalgae development.

AB Biofuel is a promising renewable energy source that has gained interest
   in recent years due to its viability and sustainability. Microalgae in
   particular have three orders of magnitude higher in oil-to-fuel yield
   when compared with other crop-based feedstocks, and therefore microalgal
   biofuels have the substantial potential to meet national energy demands.
   One challenge of the microalgae-derived biofuels is limited harvesting
   efficiency, prompting an urgent need for alternative harvesting methods
   that are cost-effective and viable. Centrifugation has been used as one
   such method of separation due to its simple principle and effectiveness.
   However, most centrifugation methods lie in the high operating costs as
   opposed to other mechanical or chemical methods. To maximize separation
   efficiency while also limiting costs, we hereby demonstrate a spiral
   microalgae separator consistent with the centrifugal method, along with
   manipulating selected parameters of the algal medium to achieve a degree
   of separation within a single experiment that yields significantly more
   concentrated algal slurry. Concentration, temperature, and pH
   manipulation were among the few selected parameters that we found to
   yield high concentrations within single, rapid separations in seconds.
   Initial concentration of algae solutions was found to relate
   proportionally to separation efficiency. Algae solutions at lower
   density experienced flocculation that aids in the separation and
   centrifugal effect whereas high density samples experienced flocculation
   of algal groups too large for efficient separation. Similarly, basic pH
   and higher temperature manipulations specifically targeted the
   flocculation of microalgae particles to form larger groups, with more
   efficient harvesting. These parameters enable the principle and benefits
   of microfluidic centrifugal separation to be demonstrated on the
   microalgae flow, with the ability to be scaled up using parallelization
   of multiple platforms: a viable alternative to the conventional
   centrifugal method.

AB Microalgal biomass is currently recognized as a promising sustainable
   source for biofuel production and carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration.
   Utilization of biophysical models are emerging to access the real-time
   feasibility of microalgal technology. In this present work, a
   comprehensive mathematical model based on the site-specific
   meteorological variables is formulated using MATLAB ODE 45 s solver to
   estimate the microalgal productivity. The predictive model framework
   utilized material balance equations with basic laws of physics, known
   constants and conservative assumptions to evaluate the water temperature
   that influences the microalgal viability. The dynamic behaviour of algal
   ponds considering the operating variables like light intensity
   (including the effects of photoinhibition), water temperature, and
   design criteria like pond depth, microalgal concentration, was used to
   estimate the performance ofT. pseudonanain open ponds. Maximum growth
   was projected in September accounting to the biomass and lipid
   productivity of 170.28 kg (dry mass) ha-1d-1and 39.42 l
   ha-1d-1respectively with a CO2capture potential of 224.77 kg (CO2)
   ha-1d-1based on the influence of water temperature. Optimal pond depth
   and operational conditions to achieve the desired productivity for the
   specific site were estimated. The maximum annual areal productivity
   dropped by 19% from 62.18 tons (dry mass) ha-1yr-1due to
   photoinhibition. The simulated biophysical model as a tool could be used
   to evaluate the biokinetic processes affecting the algal pond
   performance for further facilitation of effective decision making on
   scaling up of microalgae cultivation.

AB Background: Microalgae are promising alternate and renewable sources for
   producing valuable products such as biofuel and essential fatty acids.
   Although this is the case, there are still challenges impeding on the
   effective commercial production of microalgal products. For instance,
   their product yield is still too low. Therefore, this study was oriented
   towards enhancing triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in the
   diatomPhaeodactylum tricornutum(strain Pt4). To achieve this, a type 2
   acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase from yeast (ScDGA1) and the
   lipid droplet (LD) stabilizing oleosin protein 3 fromArabidopsis
   thaliana(AtOLEO3) were expressed in Pt4. Results: The individual
   expression ofScDGA1andAtOLEO3in Pt4 resulted in a 2.3- and 1.4-fold
   increase in TAG levels, respectively, in comparison to the wild type.
   The co-expression of both,ScDGA1andAtOLEO3, was accompanied by a
   3.6-fold increase in TAG content. On the cellular level, the lines
   co-expressingScDGA1andAtOLEO3showed the presence of the larger and
   increased numbers of lipid droplets when compared to transformants
   expressing single genes and an empty vector. Under nitrogen stress, TAG
   productivity was further increased twofold in comparison to
   nitrogen-replete conditions. While TAG accumulation was enhanced in the
   analyzed transformants, the fatty acid composition remained unchanged
   neither in the total lipid nor in the TAG profile. Conclusions: The
   co-expression of two genes was shown to be a more effective strategy for
   enhancing TAG accumulation inP. tricornutumstrain Pt4 than a single gene
   strategy. For the first time in a diatom, a LD protein from a vascular
   plant, oleosin, was shown to have an impact on TAG accumulation and on
   LD organization.

AB Oleaginous microalgae are considered as a promising resource for the
   production of biofuels. Especially diatoms arouse interest as biofuel
   producers since they are most productive in carbon fixation and very
   flexible to environmental changes in the nature. Naturally,
   triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in algae only occurs under stress
   conditions like nitrogen-limitation. We focused on Phaeodactylum strain
   Pt4 (UTEX 646), because of its ability to grow in medium with low
   salinity and therefore being suited when saline water is less available
   or for wastewater cultivation strategies. Our data show an increase in
   neutral lipids during nitrogen-depletion and predominantly 16:0 and
   16:1(n-7) accumulated in the TAG fraction. The molecular species
   composition of TAG suggests a remodeling primarily from the betaine
   lipid diacylglyceroltrimethylhomoserine (DGTS), but a contribution of
   the chloroplast galactolipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) cannot
   be excluded. Interestingly, the acyl-CoA pool is rich in 20:5(n-3) and
   22:6(n-3) in all analyzed conditions, but these fatty acids are almost
   excluded from TAG. Other metabolites most obviously depleted under
   nitrogen-starvation were amino acids, lyso-phospholipids and
   tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, whereas sulfur-containing
   metabolites as dimethylsulfoniopropionate, dimethylsulfoniobutyrate and
   methylsulfate as well as short acyl chain carnitines,
   propanoyl-carnitine and butanoyl-carnitine increased upon
   nitrogen-starvation. Moreover, the Calvin cycle may be de-regulated
   since sedoheptulose accumulated after nitrogen-depletion. Together the
   data provide now the basis for new strategies to improve lipid
   production and storage in Phaeodactylum strain Pt4.

AB Chlamydomonas (C.) reinhardtii is a potential microalga for lipid
   production. Autophagy-triggered lipid metabolism in microalgae has not
   being studied so far from a mutant of proton gradient regulation 1 like
   (PGRL1) and proton gradient regulation 5 (PGR5). In this study, C.
   reinhardtii cells (wild-type CC124 and cyclic electron transport
   dependant mutants pgrl1 and pgr5) were grown photoheterotrophically in
   high light 500 mumol photons m- 2 s- 1, where pgr5 growth was retarded
   due to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). The lipid contents
   were increased; however, carbohydrate content was decreased in pgr5.
   Further, the Nile Red (NR) fluorescence shows many lipid bodies in pgr5
   cells under high light. Similarly, the electron micrographs show that
   large vacuoles were formed in high light stress despite the grana stacks
   structure. We also observed increased production of reactive oxygen
   species, which could be one reason the cells underwent autophagy.
   Further, a significant increase of autophagy ATG8 and detections of
   ATG8-PE protein was noticed in pgr5, a hallmark characteristic for
   autophagy formation. Consequently, the triacylglycerol (TAG) content was
   increased due to diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) and phospholipid
   diacylglycerol acyl-transference (PDAT) enzymes' expression, especially
   in pgr5. Here the TAG synthesis would have been obtained from degraded
   membrane lipids in pgr5. Additionally, mono, polyunsaturated, and
   saturated fatty acids were identified more in the high light condition.
   Our study shows that the increased light induces the reactive oxygen
   species, which leads to autophagy and TAG accumulation. Therefore, the
   enhanced accumulation of TAGs can be used as feedstock for biodiesel
   production and aqua feed.

AB Microalgae are widely exploited for numerous biotechnology applications,
   including biofuels. In this context, Chlamydomonas debaryana and
   Chlorococcum sp. were isolated from Fez freshwater (Morocco), and their
   growth and lipid and carbohydrate production were assessed at different
   concentrations of NaCl, NaNO3, and K2HPO4. The results indicate a small
   positive variation in growth parameters linked to nutrient enrichment,
   with no considerable variation in carbohydrate and lipid levels in both
   algae. Moreover, a negative variation was recorded at increased salinity
   and nutrient limitation, accompanied by lipid and carbohydrate
   accumulation. Chlorococcum sp. showed better adaptation to salt stress
   below 200 mM NaCl. Furthermore, its growth and biomass productivity were
   strongly reduced by nitrogen depletion, and its lipid production reached
   47.64% DW at 3.52 mM NaNO3. As for Chlamydomonas debaryana, a
   substantial reduction in growth was induced by nutrient depletion, a
   maximal carbohydrate level was produced at less than 8.82 mM NaNO3
   (40.59% DW). The effect of phosphorus was less significant. However, a
   concentration of 0.115 mM K2HPO4 increased lipid and carbohydrate
   content without compromising biomass productivity. The results suggest
   that growing the two Chlorophyceae under these conditions seems
   interesting for biofuel production, but the loss of biomass requires a
   more efficient strategy to maximize lipid and carbohydrate accumulation
   without loss of productivity.

   form of Ci in neutral aqueous solutions, is necessary to understand the
   physiological role of tactic responses in photosynthesis. In this study,
   a two-dimensional microfluidic system enabled efficient analysis of
   phototactic and chemotactic responses by investigation of cell
   distribution in the outlet chambers. From statistical analysis (skewness
   and kurtosis) of tactic responses of different algal strains to external
   stimuli, the preferred concentrations of HCO3-forChlamydomonas
   reinhardtiiCC125 (wild type), PTS42 (random insertional mutant ofC.
   reinhardtii, high photosynthetic activity), and CC2702 (cia5mutant ofC.
   reinhardtii, unable to acclimate to low CO2concentration) were
   determined to be 27.22, 43.23, and 36.95 mM, respectively. From the
   analysis of tactic responses of wild type and 14 mutant strains, it was
   found that the photosystem II (PSII) operating efficiency and
   CO2fixation rate were strongly correlated with the phototactic
   (R2=0.931) and chemotactic response (R2=0.857), respectively. Finally,
   this system can be applied to high-throughput screening strategies for
   the rapid isolation of high photosynthetically productive microalgal
   strains based on their tactic responses.

AB Biofuels derived from microalgal lipids have demonstrated a promising
   potential as future renewable bioenergy. However, the production costs
   for microalgae-based biofuels are not economically competitive, and one
   strategy to overcome this limitation is to develop better-performing
   microalgal strains that have faster growth and higher lipid content
   through genetic screening and metabolic engineering. In this work, we
   present a high-throughput droplet microfluidics-based screening platform
   capable of analyzing growth and lipid content in populations derived
   from single cells of a randomly mutated microalgal library to identify
   and sort variants that exhibit the desired traits such as higher growth
   rate and increased lipid content. By encapsulating single cells into
   water-in-oil emulsion droplets, each variant was separately cultured
   inside an individual droplet that functioned as an independent
   bioreactor. In conjunction with an on-chip fluorescent lipid staining
   process within droplets, microalgal growth and lipid content were
   characterized by measuring chlorophyll and BODIPY fluorescence
   intensities through an integrated optical detection system in a
   flow-through manner. Droplets containing cells with higher growth and
   lipid content were selectively retrieved and further analyzed off-chip.
   The growth and lipid content screening capabilities of the developed
   platform were successfully demonstrated by first carrying out
   proof-ofconcept screening using knownChlamydomonas reinhardtiimutants.
   The platform was then utilized to screen an ethyl methanesulfonate
   (EMS)-mutatedC. reinhardtiipopulation, where eight potential mutants
   showing faster growth and higher lipid content were selected from
   200,000 examined samples, demonstrating the capability of the platform
   as a high-throughput screening tool for microalgal biofuel development.

AB Microalgae cultivation has received much interest in foods and biofuel
   production and provides a significant potential option for cleaning the
   soil, water, and environment from several contaminants. Accordingly,
   microalgae harvesting becomes essential to separate the solid-liquid
   microalgae suspension for other green technologies and sustainable
   processes. Although several physical, chemical, and physiochemical
   methods have been widely used for microalgae harvesting, their cost,
   non-environmental residues, and harvesting efficiencies are still
   questionable. This review summarized and evaluated the performance of
   different natural coagulants used for harvesting cultivated microalgae.
   The operational factors and their effect on harvesting efficiency were
   discussed. Moreover, the current challenges in utilizing several natural
   coagulants in microalgae harvesting were considered.

AB Microalgal lipids are highly promising feedstocks for biofuel
   production. Microalgal lipids, especially triacylglycerol, and practical
   applications of these compounds have received increasing attention in
   recent years. For the commercial use of microalgal lipids to be
   feasible, many fundamental biological questions must be addressed based
   on detailed studies of algal biology, including how lipid biosynthesis
   occurs and is regulated. Here, we review the current understanding of
   microalgal lipid biosynthesis, with a focus on the underlying regulatory
   mechanisms. We also present possible solutions for overcoming various
   obstacles to understanding the basic biology of microalgal lipid
   biosynthesis and the practical application of microalgae-based lipids.
   This review will provide a theoretical reference for both algal
   researchers and decision makers regarding the future directions of
   microalgal research, particularly pertaining to microalgal-based lipid
   biosynthesis.

AB Background: The green algaChlorella zofingiensishas been recognized as
   an industrially relevant strain because of its robust growth under
   multiple trophic conditions and the potential for simultaneous
   production of triacylglycerol (TAG) and the high-value keto-carotenoid
   astaxanthin. Nevertheless, the mechanism of TAG synthesis remains poorly
   understood inC. zofingiensis. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is
   thought to catalyze the committed step of TAG assembly in the Kennedy
   pathway.C. zofingiensisgenome is predicted to possess eleven putative
   DGAT-encoding genes, the greatest number ever found in green algae,
   pointing to the complexity of TAG assembly in the alga. Results: The
   transcription start site ofC. zofingiensis DGATs was determined by
   5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and their coding sequences
   were cloned and verified by sequencing, which identified tenDGATgenes
   (two type IDGATs designated asCzDGAT1AandCzDGAT1B, and eight type
   IIDGATs designated asCzDGTT1throughCzDGTT8) and revealed that the
   previous gene models of sevenDGATs were incorrect. Function
   complementation in the TAG-deficient yeast strain confirmed the
   functionality of most DGATs, with CzDGAT1A and CzDGTT5 having the
   highest activity. In vitro DGAT assay revealed that CzDGAT1A and CzDGTT5
   preferred eukaryotic and prokaryotic diacylglycerols (DAGs),
   respectively, and had overlapping yet distinctive substrate specificity
   for acyl-CoAs. Subcellular co-localization experiment in tobacco leaves
   indicated that both CzDGAT1A and CzDGTT5 were localized at endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER). Upon nitrogen deprivation, TAG was drastically induced
   inC. zofingiensis, accompanied by a considerable up-regulation
   ofCzDGAT1AandCzDGTT5. These two genes were probably regulated by the
   transcription factors (TFs) bZIP3 and MYB1, as suggested by the yeast
   one-hybrid assay and expression correlation. Moreover, heterologous
   expression ofCzDGAT1AandCzDGTT5promoted TAG accumulation and TAG yield
   in different hosts including yeast and oleaginous alga. Conclusions: Our
   study represents a pioneering work on the characterization of both type
   I and type IIC. zofingiensisDGATs by systematically integrating
   functional complementation, in vitro enzymatic assay, subcellular
   localization, yeast one-hybrid assay and overexpression in yeast and
   oleaginous alga. These results (1) update the gene models ofC.
   zofingiensisDGATs, (2) shed light on the mechanism of oleaginousness in
   which CzDGAT1A and CzDGTT5, have functional complementarity and probably
   work in collaboration at ER contributing to the abundance and complexity
   of TAG, and (3) provide engineering targets for future trait improvement
   via rational manipulation of this alga as well as other industrially
   relevant ones.

AB The cultivation of microalgae integrated with the treatment of
   wastewater has been developed for the generation of sustainable biomass
   and the remediation of wastewater. However, harvesting microalgae
   biomass from the culture system remains an energy-intensive challenge.
   In this research work, we have investigated the integration of
   microalgae culture with municipal wastewater (MWW) treatment and biomass
   bio-flocculation by filamentous fungi. A drop in the high nutrient load
   in terms of TKN (95.40%) and IP (97.11%) was noticed at 14 days in MWW
   integrated with microalgae culture. Also, the synergistic influence of
   microalgae and indigenous bacteria in MWW leads to the deduction of BOD
   (81.78%), COD (83.67%), and TOC (70.26%). The bio-harvested biomass was
   used to produce biofuel via hydrothermal liquefaction (250-350°C). The
   natively adapted filamentous fungi (A. nigerInd-Jiht-5) were isolated
   from the substrate of the wastewater habitats. The results have shown
   that microalgae have adapted well to MWW and have improved biomass
   production by approximately 29%. This bio-flocculation denotes a facile
   bio-harvesting technique with a maximum efficiency of ~90% in 24 h using
   granulated filamentous fungi. Moreover, the bio-harvested microalgae
   biomass has been accompanied by a lipid increase of ~26%. The maximum
   yield of bio-oil (~17%) in the bio-harvested microalgae biomass was
   obtained at 350°C. The C (~61%) and HHV (~29%) content of the bio-oil
   was greater than the biomass and biochar. The bio-flocculation approach
   has demonstrated an efficient and sustainable technique to harvest
   biomass to produce renewable biofuelsviahydrothermal liquefaction.

AB Background: Improvement in the performance of eukaryotic microalgae for
   biofuel and bioproduct production is largely dependent on
   characterization of metabolic mechanisms within the cell. The marine
   diatomCyclotella cryptica, which was originally identified in the
   Aquatic Species Program, is a promising strain of microalgae for
   large-scale production of biofuel and bioproducts, such as omega-3 fatty
   acids. Results: We sequenced the nuclear genome and methylome of this
   oleaginous diatom to identify the genetic traits that enable substantial
   accumulation of triacylglycerol. The genome is comprised of highly
   methylated repetitive sequence, which does not significantly change
   under silicon starved lipid induction, and data further suggests the
   primary role of DNA methylation is to suppress DNA transposition.
   Annotation of pivotal glycolytic, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate
   degradation processes reveal an expanded enzyme repertoire inC.
   crypticathat would allow for an increased metabolic capacity toward
   triacylglycerol production. Identification of previously unidentified
   genes, including those involved in carbon transport and chitin
   metabolism, provide potential targets for genetic manipulation of carbon
   flux to further increase its lipid phenotype. New genetic tools were
   developed, bringing this organism on a par with other microalgae in
   terms of genetic manipulation and characterization approaches.
   Conclusions: Functional annotation and detailed cross-species comparison
   of key carbon rich processes inC. crypticahighlights the importance of
   enzymatic subcellular compartmentation for regulation of carbon flux,
   which is often overlooked in photosynthetic microeukaryotes. The
   availability of the genome sequence, as well as advanced genetic
   manipulation tools enable further development of this organism for
   deployment in large-scale production systems.

AB Background: Microalgae are a promising new source for biomass
   production. One of the major challenges in regards to cost effectiveness
   is the biomass harvest. High energy input is required for the separation
   of the small algal cells from a large volume of surrounding media.
   Electroflocculation is reported as a promising harvesting technique to
   improve cost effectiveness within the downstream process. In the present
   study, six electrode materials were tested for electroflocculation
   ofScenedesmus acuminatus. Besides the commonly used aluminum and iron
   electrodes, magnesium, copper, zinc and brass electrodes were tested for
   biomass harvest and compared. The influence of four different voltages
   (10, 20, 30 and 40 V) was investigated and evaluated. Results:
   Electroflocculation was applicable with all tested electrode materials.
   The highest flocculation efficiency was achieved using magnesium
   electrodes followed by Al, Zn, Cu, Fe and brass. Using magnesium, 90% of
   the suspension was clarified at 40, 30, 20, and 10 V after 9.2, 12.5,
   18.5, and 43 min, respectively. All electrode materials showed the
   fastest flocculation at 40 V and the lowest at 10 V. The pH increased
   from 7.5 to values between 9.3 and 11.9 during the flocculation
   processes. Reuse of the supernatant showed no adverse effect on algal
   growth. The highest cell counts after 12 days of incubation were
   achieved with iron at 1.86*107cells ml-1and the lowest with copper at
   1.23*107cells ml-1. Conclusion: Besides the commonly used iron and/or
   aluminum electrodes, other materials like magnesium, copper, zinc and
   brass can be successfully used for microalgal biomass harvest. For
   special biomass applications like food or feed additives, metals like
   magnesium have other advantages besides their high flocculation
   efficiency such as their low toxicity at high concentrations. Higher
   voltages increased the maximum flocculation efficiency but also
   increased the required energy input.

AB Microalgae have a valuable potential for biofuels production. As a
   matter of fact, algae can produce different molecules with high energy
   content, including molecular hydrogen (H2) by the activity of a
   chloroplastic hydrogenase fueled by reducing power derived from water
   and light energy. The efficiency of this reaction, however, is limited
   and depends from an intricate relationships between oxygenic
   photosynthesis and mitochondrial respiration. The way toward obtaining
   algal strains with high productivity in photobioreactors requires
   engineering of their metabolism at multiple levels in a process
   comparable to domestication of crops that were derived from their wild
   ancestors through accumulation of genetic traits providing improved
   productivity under conditions of intensive cultivation as well as
   improved nutritional/industrial properties. This holds true for the
   production of any biofuels from algae: there is the need to isolate
   multiple traits to be combined and produce organisms with increased
   performances. Among the different limitations in H2 productivity, we
   identified three with a major relevance, namely: (i) the light
   distribution through the mass culture; (ii) the strong sensitivity of
   the hydrogenase to even very low oxygen concentrations; and (iii) the
   presence of alternative pathways, such as the cyclic electron transport,
   competing for reducing equivalents with hydrogenase and H2 production.
   In order to identify potentially favorable mutations, we generated a
   collection of random mutants in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii which were
   selected through phenotype analysis for: (i) a reduced photosynthetic
   antenna size, and thus a lower culture optical density; (ii) an altered
   photosystem II activity as a tool to manipulate the oxygen concentration
   within the culture; and (iii) State 1-State 2 transition mutants, for a
   reduced cyclic electron flow and maximized electrons flow toward the
   hydrogenase. Such a broad approach has been possible thanks to the high
   throughput application of absorption/fluorescence optical spectroscopy
   methods. Strong and weak points of this approach are discussed.

AB Background:Chlamydomonas reinhardtiiis an ideal model organism not only
   for the study of basic metabolic processes in both plants and animals
   but also the production of biofuels including hydrogen. Transgenic
   analysis ofC. reinhardtiiis now well established and very convenient,
   but inducible exogenous gene expression systems remain under-studied.
   The most commonly used heat shock-inducible system has serious effects
   on algal cell growth and is difficult and costly to control in
   large-scale culture. Previous studies of hydrogen photoproduction
   inChlamydomonasalso use this heat-inducible system to activate target
   gene transcription and hydrogen synthesis. Results: Here we describe a
   blue light-inducible system with which we achieved optogenetic
   regulation of target gene expression inC. reinhardtii. This
   light-inducible system was engineered in a photosynthetic organism for
   the first time. The photo-inducible heterodimerizing proteins CRY2 and
   CIB1 were fused to VP16 transcription activation domain and the GAL4
   DNA-binding domain, respectively. This scheme allows for transcription
   activation of the target gene downstream of the activation sequence in
   response to blue light. Using this system, we successfully engineered
   blue light-inducible hydrogen-producing transgenic alga. The transgenic
   alga was cultured under red light and grew approximately normally until
   logarithmic phase. When illuminated with blue light, the transgenic alga
   expressed the artificial miRNA targeting photosynthetic system D1
   protein, and altered hydrogen production was observed. Conclusions: The
   light-inducible system successfully activated the artificial miRNA and,
   consequently, regulation of its target gene under blue light. Moreover,
   hydrogen production was enhanced using this system, indicating a more
   convenient and efficient approach for gene expression regulation in
   large-scale microalgae cultivation. This optogenetic gene control system
   is a useful tool for gene regulation and also establishes a novel way to
   improve hydrogen production in green algae.

AB Biofuels from microalgae are currently the subject of many research
   projects to determine their feasibility as a replacement for fossil
   fuels. In order to be a successful candidate, there must be enough
   fertilizers available to support large scale production. Commercial
   fertilizers are available for biofuel production from the world
   fertilizer surplus, but due to nitrogen and phosphorus future production
   limitations, biofuels would ideally not use any of these resources to be
   a long term sustainable fuel. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
   requirements were determined for two algal
   species,ChlorellaandNannochloropsis, to produce 19 billion l per year
   (BLPY). At this scale, both algal species would use 32-49%, 32-49% and
   less than 1% of the world surplus values of nitrogen, phosphorus and
   potassium, respectively. Nutrient recycling options and alternative
   sources of nutrients were evaluated to determine their potential
   contribution of lowering the synthetic fertilizer requirement. Results
   show that all of the recycling scenarios reduce the nutrient
   requirements, but catalytic hydrothermal gasification has the largest
   reduction of 95% of the nitrogen and 90% of the phosphorus.
   Contributions from all alternative sources can also provide only 5% or
   less of the required nitrogen when produced in the gulf region. For
   phosphorus in the same region, poultry concentrated animal feeding
   operations can provide up to 28% of the requirement ofChlorella. To find
   the least amount of nitrogen that may be used, catalytic hydrothermal
   gasification was combined with all of the alternative nutrients
   available in the gulf region. The maximum amount of biofuels that could
   be produced in this location without using any synthetic fertilizers is
   5020 BLPY fromChlorellaand 4519 BLPY fromNannochloropsis. This study
   shows that the nutrient requirement for biofuel production from
   microalgae will not be a limitation if recycling methods within the
   process chain and alternative sources of nutrients are utilized.

AB Background: Because of their high biomass productivity and their ability
   to accumulate high levels of energy-rich reserve compounds such as oils
   or starch, microalgae represent a promising feedstock for the production
   of biofuel. Accumulation of reserve compounds takes place when
   microalgae face adverse situations such as nutrient shortage, conditions
   which also provoke a stop in cell division, and down-regulation of
   photosynthesis. Despite growing interest in microalgal biofuels, little
   is known about molecular mechanisms controlling carbon reserve
   formation. In order to discover new regulatory mechanisms, and identify
   genes of interest to boost the potential of microalgae for biofuel
   production, we developed a forward genetic approach in the model
   microalgaChlamydomonas reinhardtii. Results: By screening an insertional
   mutant library on the ability of mutants to accumulate and re-mobilize
   reserve compounds, we isolated aChlamydomonasmutant (starch degradation
   1,std1) deficient for a dual-specificity
   tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK). Thestd1mutant
   accumulates higher levels of starch and oil than wild-type and maintains
   a higher photosynthetic activity under nitrogen starvation. Phylogenetic
   analysis revealed that this kinase (named DYRKP) belongs to a
   plant-specific subgroup of the evolutionarily conserved DYRK kinase
   family. Furthermore, hyper-accumulation of storage compounds occurs
   instd1mostly under low light in photoautotrophic condition, suggesting
   that the kinase normally acts under conditions of low energy status to
   limit reserve accumulation. Conclusions: The DYRKP kinase is proposed to
   act as a negative regulator of the sink capacity of photosynthetic cells
   that integrates nutrient and energy signals. Inactivation of the kinase
   strongly boosts accumulation of reserve compounds under photoautotrophic
   nitrogen deprivation and allows maintaining high photosynthetic
   activity. The DYRKP kinase therefore represents an attractive target for
   improving the energy density of microalgae or crop plants.

AB Microalgae cultivation has gained much interest in terms of the
   production of foods, biofuels, and bioactive compounds and offers a
   great potential option for cleaning the environment through CO2
   sequestration and wastewater treatment. Although open pond cultivation
   is most affordable option, there tends to be insufficient control on
   growth conditions and the risk of contamination. In contrast, while
   providing minimal risk of contamination, closed photobioreactors offer
   better control on culture conditions, such as: CO2 supply, water supply,
   optimal temperatures, efficient exposure to light, culture density, pH
   levels, and mixing rates. For a large scale production of biomass,
   efficient photobioreactors are required. This review paper describes
   general design considerations pertaining to photobioreactor systems, in
   order to cultivate microalgae for biomass production. It also discusses
   the current challenges in designing of photobioreactors for the
   production of low-cost biomass.

AB The premise that microalgae could be used to produce landscapes of
   biofuel, nutrition, and bioremediation is gaining popularity. The four
   main factors influential to microalgae growth are light, CO2, nutrients,
   and process conditions-including temperature and pH. Compared to other
   open systems such as ponds, control and efficiency in flat plate and
   tubular type photobioreactors are much higher. A photobioreactor needs
   to be developed to enhance the mass transport, and light penetration,
   and to reduce contamination. Every kind of photobioreactor has its
   advantages and limitations in using the airlift, bubble column, and
   stirred tank. Thus, the use of hybrid bioreactors makes it possible to
   eliminate individual limitations. This review discusses and analyzes the
   features of photobioreactor systems, their drawbacks, and the progress
   achieved in the field of microalgae production.

AB Background: Chromochloris zofingiensis, an oleaginous microalga, is a
   promising feedstock for the co-production of triacylglycerol (TAG)-based
   biodiesel and the high-value product astaxanthin. To reveal the
   molecular mechanism of TAG and astaxanthin biosynthesis during
   transitions of sulfur nutritional status, namely sulfur-starvation (SS)
   and sulfur-replenishment (SR), the physiological responses and the
   transcriptomic dynamics of C. zofingiensis were examined. Results: The
   results revealed a reversible TAG and astaxanthin accumulation under SS,
   which is correlated with the reduction of cell growth and protein
   content, indicating the reallocation of carbon. By correlating the data
   on the physiological and transcriptional responses to different sulfur
   nutritional status, a model for the underlying mechanism of TAG and
   astaxanthin accumulation in C. zofingiensis was postulated, which
   involved up-regulation of key genes including diacylglycerol
   acyltransferase (DGTT5) and beta-carotene ketolase (BKT1), increased
   energy and NADPH supply by elevating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
   and the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, and the increased
   carbon precursors (pyruvate and acetyl-CoA) through central carbon
   metabolism. In addition, the net enhancement of the de novo biosynthesis
   of fatty acids and the re-direction of the terpenoid precursors toward
   the branch catalyzed by lycopene beta cyclase (LCYb) and BKT1 escalated
   the substrate availability for the biosynthesis of TAG and astaxanthin,
   respectively. Conclusions: In this study, the time-resolved
   transcriptional analysis of C. zofingiensis under SS and SR conditions
   was reported for the first time to elucidate the regulatory roles of key
   enzymes, including DGTT5, BKT1 and LCYb, in the underlying mechanisms of
   TAG and astaxanthin accumulation.

AB Traditional autotrophic microalgae exhibit low rates of organic carbon
   assimilation and conversion to useful compounds when switching to
   mixotrophic or heterotrophic growth. The goal of this study was to
   investigate the effect of inorganic carbon limitation on the efficiency
   of organic carbon (glycerol) assimilation and conversion to total fatty
   acids (TFAs) or the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). An oleaginous Monodus subterraneus was
   selected and six cultivation conditions were set, including
   Autotrophy-no aeration, Autotrophy-aeration, Mixotrophy-no aeration,
   Mixotrophy-no aeration & no Na2CO3, Mixotrophy-aeration, and
   Heterotrophy. The results showed M. subterraneus could utilize glycerol
   and grow under mixotrophic condition, while it was not occurred under
   heterotrophy. Superiority of mixotrophy to autotrophy on biomass
   productivity was more obvious under inorganic carbon limitation (no
   aeration or no Na2CO3) than inorganic carbon supply (aeration and
   existing Na2CO3 in the medium). CO2 limitation (no aeration) decreased
   content (of dry weight) and production (in medium) of TFAs, which was
   not evident in mixotrophy. CO2 limitation and inorganic carbon substrate
   stress largely improved the COD yield of TFAs and EPA under mixotrophic
   condition. TFA yield (%COD) under Mixotrophy-no aeration & no Na2CO3 was
   maximum (22.82%), and was almost two-fold higher than that under
   Mixotrophy-no aeration and nearly three-fold higher than that with
   Mixotrophy-aeration. EPA yield (% COD) under mixotrophy-no aeration & no
   Na2CO3 was maximum (6.58%). These results suggested that inorganic
   carbon limitation is a potentially useful method to enhance conversion
   of organic carbon to TFAs. Furthermore, the results suggest an
   application to obtain high value compounds (TFAs or EPA) combined with a
   high assimilation rate of waste glycerol from biodiesel and
   epichlorohydrin production by microalgae.

AB Modern agriculture needs proper solutions to face the current trend of
   pesticides and fertilizers reduction. One of the available leverages to
   support this transition is the use of bioproducts that are more
   environmentally friendly and less hazardous for human health. Among
   them, blue biotechnology and more precisely seaweed and microalgae gain
   interest every year in the scientific community. In agriculture,
   seaweeds (Macroalgae) have been used in the production of plant
   biostimulants while microalgae still remain unexploited. Microalgae are
   widely described as renewable sources of biofuels, bioingredients and
   biologically active compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids
   (PUFAs), carotenoids, phycobiliproteins, sterols, vitamins and
   polysaccharides, which attract considerable interest in both scientific
   and industrial communities. They affect agricultural crops for
   enhancement of plant growth, seedling growth. They can also improve
   nutrient incorporation, fruit setting, resistance properties against
   pests and diseases, improving stress management (drought, salinity and
   temperature). The present review aimed at the interest of blue
   biotechnology in agronomy, with a specific focus on microalgae, their
   biological activities and their possible application in agriculture as a
   potentially sustainable alternative for enhanced crop performance,
   nutrient uptake and resilience to environmental stress. This review does
   not only present a comprehensive study of microalgae as plant
   biostimulants but also as biofertilizers, with a particular emphasis on
   future challenges these solutions will have to deal with, microalgae
   being able to synthesize secondary metabolites with potential
   biopesticidal action.

AB Today's global problems and challenges have given rise to a new field of
   interest -bioeconomics. It is strongly related tophycoprospecting, or
   searching for specific algal strains of commercial importance. There has
   been growing interest in the small algal class Eustigmatophyceae in
   recent years. These microscopic stramenopilic algae, which have all the
   advantages of microalgal cultivation, have proved to be promising
   commercial sources of valuable compounds (e.g. carotenoids, unsaturated
   fatty acids, amino acids) in aquaculture, agriculture, biofuels
   production, medicine, pharmaceutics, cosmetics, wastewater treatment,
   environmental control, etc. The present review shows the main genera and
   strains of commercial importance, outlines their main fields of
   application and some gaps in our knowledge in this aspect. Today, the
   great promising bioeconomical potential of these algae has generally
   been recognized, but in the present state of its infancy, it is far from
   being fully exploited.

AB Recently, microalgal biomass has become an attractive and sustainable
   feedstock for renewable production of various biochemicals and biofuels.
   However, attaining required productivity remains a key challenge to
   develop industrial applications. Fortunately, mixotrophic cultivation
   strategy (MCS) is leading to higher productivity due to the metabolic
   ability of some microalgal strain to utilise both photosynthesis and
   organic carbon compared to phototrophic or heterotrophic processes. The
   potential of MCS is being explored by researchers for maximized
   biochemicals and biofuels production however it requires further
   development yet to reach commercialization stage. In this review, recent
   developments in the MCS bioprocess for selective value-added
   (carotenoids) products have been reviewed; synergistic mechanism of
   carbon and energy was conferred. Moreover, the metabolic regulation of
   microalgae under MCS for utilized carbon forms and carbon recycling was
   demonstrated; Additionally, the opportunities and challenges of
   large-scale MCS have been discussed.

AB Recently, microalgae have been regarded as useful organisms worldwide
   due to their potential for extensive application in renewable energy,
   aquaculture, biofuel and pharmaceuticals. Different species of
   microalgae have drawn significant interest because of their biological
   and chemical composition, which could potentially be useful in
   developing new applications in the aquaculture, biofuel and
   pharmaceutical industries. Furthermore, various culture techniques have
   been developed based on the species and environmental condition to
   ensure its mass production. Although microalgae are feasible sources for
   a successful biological product, limitations and challenges remain,
   which need to be solved with the innovation of new alternative
   technology in culturing and producing successful mass cultures. In this
   review, several current microalgae species production methods will be
   discussed based on their applications, and biological and chemical
   compositions, which are influenced by their growth parameters.

AB Special attention is required to the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous
   in treated wastewaters. Although, there are a wide range of techniques
   commercially available for nutrient up-take, these processes entail high
   investment and operational costs. In the other hand, microalgae growth
   can simultaneously remove inorganic constituents of wastewater and
   produce energy rich biomass. Among all the cultivation technologies,
   High Rate Algae Ponds (HRAPs), are accepted as the most appropriate
   system. However, the optimization of the operation that maximizes the
   productivity, nutrient removal and lipid content in the biomass
   generated has not been established. In this study, the effect of two
   levels of depth and the addition of CO2 were evaluated. Batch essays
   were used for the calculation of the kinetic parameters of microbial
   growth that determine the optimum conditions for continuous operation.
   Nutrient removal and lipid content of the biomass generated were
   analyzed. The best conditions were found at depth of 0.3 m with CO2
   addition (biomass productivity of 26.2 g TSS m-2 d-1 and a lipid
   productivity of 6.0 g lipids m-2 d-1) in continuous mode. The
   concentration of nutrients was in all cases below discharge limits
   established by the most restrictive regulation for wastewater discharge.

TI Effect of microalgae and bacteria inoculation on the startup of
   bioreactors for paper pulp wastewater and biofuel production.
SO Journal of Environmental Management

U2 16
AB The use of microalgae and bacteria as a strategy for the startup of
   bioreactors for the treatment of industrial wastewater can be a
   sustainable and economically viable alternative. This technology model
   provides satisfactory results in the nitrification and denitrification
   process for nitrogen removal, organic matter removal, biomass growth,
   sedimentation, and byproducts recovery for added-value product
   production. The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance
   of microalgae and bacteria in their symbiotic process when used in the
   treatment of paper pulp industry wastewater. The experiment, lasting
   fourteen days, utilized four bioreactors with varying concentrations in
   mgVSS/L of microalgae to bacteria ratio (R1-100:100, R2-100:300,
   R3-100:500, R4-300:100) in the startup process. Regarding the sludge
   volumetric index (SVI), the results show that the R1 and R2 reactors
   developed SVI30/SVI10 biomass in the range of 85.57  7.33% and 84.72 
   8.19%, respectively. The lipid content in the biomass of reactors R1,
   R2, R3 e R4 was 13%, 7%, 19%, and 22%, respectively. This high oil
   content at the end of the batch, may be related to the nutritional
   stress that the species underwent during this feeding regime. In terms
   of chlorophyll, the bioreactor with an initial inoculation of 100:100
   showed better symbiotic growth of microalgae and bacteria, allowing
   exponential growth of microalgae. The total chlorophyll value for this
   bioreactor was 801.46  196.96 mug/L. Biological removal of nitrogen from
   wastewater from the paper pulp industry is a challenge due to the
   characteristics of the effluent, but the four reactors operated in a
   single batch obtained good nitrogen removal. Ammonia nitrogen removal
   performances were 91.55  9.99%, 72.13  19.18%, 64.04  21.34%, and 86.15 
   30.10% in R1, R2, R3, and R4, respectively.

AB Algae cultivation in open raceway ponds is considered the most
   economical method for photosynthetically producing biomass for biofuels,
   chemical feedstocks, and other high-value products. One of the primary
   challenges for open ponds is diminished biomass yields due to attack by
   grazers, competitors, and infectious organisms. Higher-frequency
   observations are needed for detection of grazer infections, which can
   rapidly reduce biomass levels. In this study, real-time measurements
   were performed using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) to
   monitor the impact of grazer infections on cyanobacterial cultures.
   Numerous volatile gases were produced during healthy growth periods from
   freshwater Synechococcus elongatus Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC)
   7942, with 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one serving as a unique metabolic
   indicator of exponential growth. Following the introduction of a
   Tetrahymena ciliate grazer, the concentrations of multiple volatile
   species were observed to change after a latent period as short as 18 h.
   Nitrogenous gases, including ammonia and pyrroline, were found to be
   reliable indicators of grazing. Detection of grazing by CIMS showed
   indicators of infections much sooner than traditional methods,
   microscopy, and continuous fluorescence, which did not detect changes
   until 37 to 76 h after CIMS detection. CIMS analysis of gases produced
   by PCC 7942 further shows a complex temporal array of biomass-dependent
   volatile gas production, which demonstrates the potential for using
   volatile gas analysis as a diagnostic for grazer infections. Overall,
   these results show promise for the use of continuous volatile metabolite
   monitoring for the detection of grazing in algal monocultures,
   potentially reducing current grazing-induced biomass losses, which could
   save hundreds of millions of dollars.

AB Biofuels are a new priority in efforts to reduce dependence on fossil
   fuels; nevertheless, the rapid increase in production of biofuel
   feedstock may threaten biodiversity. There are general principles that
   should be used in developing guidelines for certifying
   biodiversity-friendly biofuels. First, biofuel feedstocks should be
   grown with environmentally safe and biodiversity-friendly agricultural
   practices. The sustainability of any biofuel feedstock depends on good
   growing practices and sound environmental practices throughout the
   fuel-production life cycle. Second, the ecological footprint of a
   biofuel, in terms of the land area needed to grow sufficient quantities
   of the feedstock, should be minimized. The best alternatives appear to
   be fuels of the future, especially fuels derived from microalgae. Third,
   biofuels that can sequester carbon or that have a negative or zero
   carbon balance when viewed over the entire production life cycle should
   be given high priority. Corn-based ethanol is the worst among the
   alternatives that are available at present, although this is the biofuel
   that is most advanced for commercial production in the United States. We
   urge aggressive pursuit of alternatives to corn as a biofuel feedstock.
   Conservation biologists can significantly broaden and deepen efforts to
   develop sustainable fuels by playing active roles in pursuing research
   on biodiversity-friendly biofuel production practices and by helping
   define biodiversity-friendly biofuel certification standards.

AB Our reliance on agriculture for sustenance, healthcare, and resources
   has been essential since the dawn of civilization. However, traditional
   agricultural practices are no longer adequate to meet the demands of a
   burgeoning population amidst climate-driven agricultural challenges.
   Microalgae emerge as a beacon of hope, offering a sustainable and
   renewable source of food, animal feed, and energy. Their rapid growth
   rates, adaptability to non-arable land and non-potable water, and
   diverse bioproduct range, encompassing biofuels and nutraceuticals,
   position them as a cornerstone of future resource management.
   Furthermore, microalgae's ability to capture carbon aligns with
   environmental conservation goals. While microalgae offers significant
   benefits, obstacles in cost-effective biomass production persist, which
   curtails broader application. This review examines microalgae compared
   to other host platforms, highlighting current innovative approaches
   aimed at overcoming existing barriers. These approaches include a range
   of techniques, from gene editing, synthetic promoters, and mutagenesis
   to selective breeding and metabolic engineering through transcription
   factors.

AB Background: In comparison with phototrophic growth, heterotrophic
   conditions can significantly increase growth rates, final cell number
   and cell mass in microalgae cultures.Neochloris oleoabundansis a
   microalga of biotechnological interest that accumulates lipids under
   phototrophic and nitrogen-limited conditions. Heterotrophic flask
   culture experiments were conducted to identify carbon sources that can
   be metabolized byN. oleoabundans, and bioreactor batch and fed-batch
   (nitrate pulse additions) cultures supplemented with glucose were
   performed to study the cellular composition of the microalgae under
   balanced and high C/N ratios (glucose/nitrate). Results:N.
   oleoabundanswas able to grow using glucose and cellobiose as sole carbon
   sources under strict heterotrophic conditions. Under a balanced C/N
   ratio of 17 and using bioreactor batch cultures containing 3 g/L
   glucose, a maximal cell mass of 1.72 g/L was found, with protein being
   the major cell component (44% w/w). A maximal cell mass of 9.2 g/L was
   obtained using batch cultures at a C/N ratio of 278. Under these
   conditions, lipid accumulation was promoted (up to 52% w/w) through
   N-limitation, resulting in high lipid productivity (528.5 mg/L/day).
   Fed-batch cultures were performed at a C/N ratio of 278 and with nitrate
   pulse additions. This condition allowed a maximal cell mass of 14.2 g/L
   to be achieved and switched the metabolism to carbohydrate synthesis (up
   to 54% of dry weight), mainly in the form of starch. It was found that
   transmembrane transport under these conditions was dependent on a
   proton-motive force, indicating that glucose is transported by a
   symporter. Conclusions:N. oleoabundanswas able to grow under strict
   heterotrophic culture conditions with glucose or cellobiose as the only
   carbon source. The glucose used is transported by a symporter system.
   Batch cultures with a balanced C/N ratio accumulate proteins as the
   major cellular component; a high C/N ratio significantly increased the
   dry cell mass and resulted in a high lipid content, and a high cell
   density was achieved using fed-batch cultures promoting carbohydrate
   accumulation. These results suggest heterotrophic batch cultures ofN.
   oleoabundansas an alternative for the production of proteins or lipids
   with simple culture strategies and minimal-mineral media supplemented
   with glucose.

AB Globally, microalgae are gaining attention due to their high nutritional
   value and broad application in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, food,
   cosmetics, bio-fertilizer, and biofuel industries. Microalgal-based
   foods have been shown a positive impact on human health by acting as
   antioxidants, antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory agents, and antiviral
   agents. Scale-up, production cost, and safety issues are the significant
   challenges in microalgae product commercialization. However, various
   techniques have been developed to overcome these challenges and to
   produce microalgae bio-products in a high amount and make them safe for
   human and animals use. Recently, multiple techniques such as metabolic
   and genetic engineering have emerged to overcome these limitations. The
   present review focused on the application of these engineering tools to
   improve biomass yield and nutrient quality in microalgae. However, these
   tools are proved to be very effective in enhancing the nutrients in
   microalgae. Limited success has been achieved to improve the quality at
   the industrial level.

TI Phosphorus, chemical base and other renewables from wastewater with
   three 168-L microbial electrolysis cells and other unit operations.
SO Chemical Engineering Journal
VL 390

AB Phosphate rock is a depleting resource and wastewater a sustainable
   long-term alternative for phosphorous mining. In modern wastewater
   treatment phosphate is concentrated 7500 times from wastewater into
   sludge as iron phosphate (FeP). Recently developed bioelectrochemical
   reactors enabled phosphate recovery from sewage sludge containing FeP.
   The integrated bioelectric process was found of much broader utility
   than initially elaborated. It refines all principle components of
   wastewater. The implementation is confronted to a number of challenges.
   Three pilot microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) of 168 L each were
   constructed and installed in different municipal wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTPs). The scale-up MECs generated renewable chemical base and
   co-extracted abundant species such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and NH4+ from
   wastewater. The chemical base remobilized phosphate quantitatively from
   iron phosphates contained in digested sewage sludge. Phosphate extracts
   contained ammonia and upon magnesium (Mg2+) addition struvite
   crystalized. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) on
   heavy metals, Direct Mercury Analysis (DMA), Liquid Chromatography Mass
   Spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) on organic micropollutants, metagenomics
   sequencing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDS), and X-Ray
   Diffraction (XRD) indicated that a highly pure struvite-fertilizer was
   produced. Microbial electricity co-generation was verified by
   electrochemical characterisation and microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA
   V4-V5 methodology. Geobacter, Dechloromonas, Desulfobulbus and
   cyanobacteria were the principal electrogens found. All in all,
   renewable chemical base as well as phosphate were obtained in high
   quantities and other renewables became accessible such as the critical
   material magnesium and other compounds of importance like ammonia,
   potassium, calcium, solid P-free sludge useful as biofuel and purified
   water. In general, the process recycles important compounds from waste,
   in a close to traceless manner while purifying wastewater.

AB Background: Heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae has been proposed as
   a viable alternative method for novel high-value biomolecules, enriched
   biomass, and biofuel production because of their allowance of high cell
   density levels, as well as simple production technology. Tetradesmus
   bernardii, a newly isolated high-yielding oleaginous microalga under
   photoautotrophic conditions, is able to grow heterotrophically, meaning
   that it can consume organic carbon sources in dark condition. We
   investigated the effect of different carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios on the
   growth and lipid accumulation of T. bernardii in heterotrophic batch
   culture under two nitrogen sources (NaNO3 and CO(NH2)2). In addition, we
   conducted time-resolved transcriptome analysis to reveal the metabolic
   mechanism of T. bernardii in heterotrophic culture. Results: T.
   bernardii can accumulate high biomass concentrations in heterotrophic
   batch culture where the highest biomass of 46.09 g/L was achieved at 100
   g/L glucose concentration. The rate of glucose to biomass exceeded 55%
   when the glucose concentration was less than 80 g/L, and the C/N ratio
   was 44 at urea treatment. The culture was beneficial to lipid
   accumulation at a C/N ratio between 110 and 130. NaNO3 used as a
   nitrogen source enhanced the lipid content more than urea, and the
   highest lipid content was 45% of dry weight. We performed RNA-seq to
   analyze the time-resolved transcriptome of T. bernardii. As the nitrogen
   was consumed in the medium, nitrogen metabolism-related genes were
   significantly up-regulated to speed up the N metabolic cycle. As
   chloroplasts were destroyed in the dark, the metabolism of cells was
   transferred from chloroplasts to cytoplasm. However, storage of
   carbohydrate in chloroplast remained active, mainly the synthesis of
   starch, and the precursor of starch synthesis in heterotrophic culture
   may largely come from the absorption of organic carbon source (glucose).
   With regard to lipid metabolism, the related genes of fatty acid
   synthesis in low nitrogen concentration increased gradually with the
   extension of cultivation time. Conclusion: T. bernardii exhibited rapid
   growth and high lipid accumulation in heterotrophic culture. It may be a
   potential candidate for biomass and biofuel production. Transcriptome
   analysis showed that multilevel regulation ensured the conversion from
   carbon to the synthesis of carbohydrate and lipid.

AB Background: Microalgal strain development through genetic engineering
   has received much attention as a way to improve the traits of microalgae
   suitable for biofuel production. However, there are still some
   limitations in application of genetically modified organisms. In this
   regard, there has been recent interest in the isolation and
   characterization of superior strains naturally modified and/or adapted
   under a certain condition and on the interpretation of phenotypic
   changes through the whole genome sequencing. Results: In this study, we
   isolated and characterized a novel derivative ofC. reinhardtii, whose
   phenotypic traits diverged significantly from its ancestral strain,C.
   reinhardtiiCC-124. This strain, designated as CC-124H, displayed cell
   population containing increased numbers of larger cells, which resulted
   in an increased biomass productivity compared to its ancestor CC-124.
   CC-124H was further compared with the CC-124 wild-type strain which
   underwent long-term storage under low light condition, designated as
   CC-124 L. In an effort to evaluate the potential of CC-124H for biofuel
   production, we also found that CC-124H accumulated 116 and 66% greater
   lipids than that of the CC-124 L, after 4 days under nitrogen and sulfur
   depleted conditions, respectively. Taken together, our results revealed
   that CC-124H had significantly increased fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)
   yields that were 2.66 and 1.98 times higher than that of the CC-124 L at
   4 days after the onset of cultivation under N and S depleted conditions,
   respectively, and these higher FAME yields were still maintained by day
   8. We next analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
   insertion/deletions (indels) based on the whole genome sequencing. The
   result revealed that of the 44 CDS region alterations, 34 resulted in
   non-synonymous substitutions within 33 genes which may mostly be
   involved in cell cycle, division or proliferation. Conclusion: Our
   phenotypic analysis, which emphasized lipid productivity, clearly
   revealed that CC-124H had a dramatically enhanced biomass and lipid
   content compared to the CC-124 L. Moreover, SNPs and indels analysis
   enabled us to identify 34 of non-synonymous substitutions which may
   result in phenotypic changes of CC-124H. All of these results suggest
   that the concept of adaptive evolution combined with genome wide
   analysis can be applied to microalgal strain development for biofuel
   production.

AB Recent years, algal polysaccharides were mainly investigated for
   pharmaceutical, nutraceuticals and biomedical applications due to their
   promising bioactive properties. Moreover, it is now becoming a potential
   source for several non-medical and non-food applications in which
   biofuels are a major sector. The marine algae contain a variety of
   polysaccharides comprising 15-75% of dry biomass, including
   mucopolysaccharides, structured as well as storage polysaccharides.
   Industrial and dietary use of algal polysaccharide is on the rise,
   having an economic global impact. They have been industrially used as
   stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickeners, animal feed, foods and beverages,
   pharmaceuticals among others. Despite its low calorie and fat content,
   seaweed contains a significant amount of fiber (polysaccharide) that is
   beneficial to the digestive system. In industries for pharmaceuticals
   and biomedicine, alginates, fucoidans, ulvans, carrageenans, and chitin
   are becoming increasingly important. In fact, little research has been
   conducted on microalgal polysaccharides, linking their chemical
   structure with their biological activity. Moreover, with breakthrough
   technologies viable microalgal cultivation and improved carbohydrate
   production must be developed. Several studies highlighted the recent
   updates on microalgae, their key challenges in production and
   characterization of microalgal polysaccharides but lacking connection of
   chemical structure and functionality. The present review provides a
   brief summary of the key advances in the feasible production strategies
   of microalgal polysaccharides to make its extraction economically
   feasible, review on recent cost-effective extraction and purification
   methods. Moreover, analyzed structure divergence and tried to correlate
   their chemical structure with functionality prior to describing its
   broader potential beyond its existing applications.

AB Biological CO2fixation and wastewater treatment by using microalgae has
   recently received growing interest. Microalgae can be cultivated in
   photobioreactors by utilizing CO2from point sources such as power
   plants, cement manufacturing facilities and waste water from industrial,
   municipal, dairy facilities. These processes can provide the nutrient
   sources for sunlight microalgae photosynthesis. Thus, microalgae culture
   can contribute simultaneously to both CO2fixation and wastewater
   treatment. This article presents a critical review, focusing on various
   photobioreactors and microalgae species cultures in wastewater that can
   capture high amounts of CO2and provide high quality biofuel. In this
   respect, a number of relevant topics are discussed in this review: (a)
   current wastewater treatment processes, (b) wastewater treatment using
   microalgae, (c) classification of photobioreactors, (d) microalgae
   growth parameters and (d) the CO2capture mechanism.

AB This review shows the potential of algae in combating both air and water
   pollution and the production of biofuel feedstock in a much cleaner
   manner. Various research articles published in leading journals have
   been studied thoroughly to give a critical mentioning of various methods
   of cultivation in different reactors. It provides a comprehensive
   narration about (a) selection of suitable algal species (b) selection of
   a suitable mode for growing (c) selection of suitable reactor type and
   (d) carbon bio-fixation. This review found that hybrid airlift
   photobioreactors are highly efficient because it exploits the benefits
   of two different types of reactors to overcome the drawbacks. It also
   provides salient features in the selection of suitable microalgal
   species. The mixotrophic culture mode is found to be best for the
   integrated approach. The models used to calculate carbon dioxide
   bio-fixation rate would be useful for engineers and researchers to
   quantify the carbon removal.

AB Over the years, algae have found wide scope of utility in a variety of
   environmentally beneficial processes like biofuel production, removal of
   heavy metals from wastewater sources for potential bioremediation,
   monitoring water pollution and source of animal nutrition. However, the
   conventional harvesting methods pose a set-back in terms of energy, cost
   and operational complications due to the small size of microalgae. Of
   all the processes, harvesting alone corresponds to approximately 30% of
   the total production costs. Recent advancements in the microalgal
   technology have brought many efficient techniques into use for improved
   recovery of microalgae. This review comprehends the development,
   principle, influencing parameters and directions to future research of
   one of the state-of-the-art approaches for harvesting microalgae,
   electrochemical technology. Though this area was previously explored for
   its application in wastewater treatment, it has lately gained momentum
   in the field of microalgae due to its economic efficiency. This paper
   highlights the three prime processes used to yield microalgae namely
   electroflocculation, electroflotation and a combined
   electrocoagulation-flotation (ECF) system. Several encroachments and
   strategies among these techniques have also been elucidated. The review
   focusses on the effect of most significant process controlling
   parameters such as reactor and electrode design, various surface
   properties of microalgae, current, pH, salinity and agitation that
   influence harvesting. In addition, the economy and energy aspects that
   emphasize the welfares of this technology over others have been
   extensively discussed. The overall work aims to provide an insight into
   the electrochemical methods, their challenges and opportunities that
   might be beneficial for carrying out further research and scope for
   industrial applications.

AB A technoeconomic assessment (TEA) has been conducted of the feasibility
   of large-scale application of microalgal culture technology (MCT) to the
   combined mitigation of CO2 emissions from flue gases and nutrient
   discharges from wastewater in the Arabian Gulf. The assessment has
   incorporated the selection of the algal species and MCT technologies,
   the extent of nutrient removal, and the biomass/biofuel production rate.
   The cost benefit of the abatement of pollutants (in the form of CO2 and
   nutrient discharges) was included by assigning appropriate credits to
   these contributions. The overall economic viability was quantified as
   the break-even selling price (BESP) of the generated biocrude, taken to
   be the price at which the product must sell to cover the operating
   expenditure (OPEX). Based on available information and optimal
   operational conditions, the BESP was calculated as being $0.544 per kg
   biomass, equating to $0.9 L-1 for the extracted biocrude, the credited
   items contributing ~14% of this figure. The BESP was found to be most
   sensitive to the algal growth rate mu, the BESP changing by 24% in
   response to a 20% change in mu. Whilst the terms of reference of the
   study are limited to OPEX contributors, the potential for sustainability
   associated with the innately reliably high levels of natural light in
   the Gulf region appear to provide auspicious circumstances for
   large-scale implementation of MCT. For emerging economies with a
   comparable climate but without a mineral oil-based economy a greater
   financial benefit from the proposed scheme would arise.

AB Nowadays there is a growing interest on the use of both lignocellulosic
   and algae biomass to produce biofuels (i.e. biohydrogen, ethanol and
   methane), as future alternatives to fossil fuels. In this purpose,
   thermal and thermo-chemical pretreatments have been widely investigated
   to overcome the natural physico-chemical barriers of such biomass and to
   enhance biofuel production from lignocellulosic residues and, more
   recently, marine biomass (i.e. macro and microalgae). However, the
   pretreatment technologies lead not only to the conversion of
   carbohydrate polymers (ie cellulose, hemicelluloses, starch, agar) to
   soluble monomeric sugar (ie glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose), but
   also the generation of various by-products (i.e. furfural and 5-HMF). In
   the case of lignocellulosic residues, part of the lignin can also be
   degraded in lignin derived by-products, mainly composed of phenolic
   compounds. Although the negative impact of such by-products on ethanol
   production has been widely described in literature, studies on their
   impact on biohydrogen and methane production operated with mixed
   cultures are still very limited. This review aims to summarise and
   discuss literature data on the impact of pre-treatment by-products on
   H2-producing dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion processes when
   using mixed cultures as inoculum. As a summary, furanic (5-HMF,
   furfural) and phenolic compounds were found to be stronger inhibitors of
   the microbial dark fermentation than the full anaerobic digestion
   process. Such observations can be explained by differences in process
   parameters: anaerobic digestion is performed with more complex mixed
   cultures, lower substrate/inoculum and by-products/inoculum ratios and
   longer batch incubation times than dark fermentation. Finally, it has
   been reported that, during dark fermentation process, the presence of
   by-products could lead to a metabolic shift from H2-producing pathways
   (i.e. acetate and butyrate) to non-H2-producing pathways (i.e. lactate,
   ethanol and propionate) and whatever the metabolic route, metabolites
   can be all further converted into methane, but at different rates.

AB The intensified attention to health, the growth of an elderly
   population, the changing lifestyles, and the medical discoveries have
   increased demand for natural and nutrient-rich foods, shaping the
   popularity of microalgae products. Microalgae thanks to their metabolic
   versatility represent a promising solution for a 'green' economy,
   exploiting non-arable land, non-potable water, capturing carbon dioxide
   (CO2) and solar energy. The interest in microalgae is justified by their
   high content of bioactive molecules, such as amino acids, peptides,
   proteins, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, polyunsaturated fatty acids
   (as omega-3 fatty acids), pigments (as beta-carotene, astaxanthin,
   fucoxanthin, phycocyanin, zeaxanthin and lutein), or mineral elements.
   Such molecules are of interest for human and animal nutrition, cosmetic
   and biofuel production, for which microalgae are potential renewable
   sources. Microalgae, also, represent effective biological systems for
   treating a variety of wastewaters and can be used as a CO2mitigation
   approach, helping to combat greenhouse gases and global warming
   emergencies. Recently a growing interest has focused on extremophilic
   microalgae species, which are easier to cultivate axenically and
   represent good candidates for open pond cultivation. In some cases, the
   cultivation and/or harvesting systems are still immature, but novel
   techniques appear as promising solutions to overcome such barriers. This
   review provides an overview on the actual microalgae cultivation systems
   and the current state of their biotechnological applications to obtain
   high value compounds or ingredients. Moreover, potential and future
   research opportunities for environment, human and animal benefits are
   pointed out.

AB Macroalgae (seaweeds) are drawing interest as potential tools for
   climate mitigation within a burgeoning blue carbon agenda. With the high
   rates of net primary productivity, they are one of the main carbon sinks
   in the global ocean, both as biomass standing stock and as vectors of
   carbon export through detritus pathways. When coupled with their
   intrinsic ecological value, their contribution to coastal economies, and
   their current and future scope for aquaculture production, it is perhaps
   unsurprising that macroalgae have become a focus for nature-based carbon
   sequestration. However, the research community must guard against the
   hyperbole that is beginning to permeate the conversation, such as that
   which beset the microalgae biofuel movement. Macroalgae undoubtedly have
   a role to play in combating carbon pollution, and perhaps before
   significant investment is committed to ramping up macroalgae
   aquaculture, a more pragmatic view of its contribution to natural
   capital is justified. This article takes an objective look at the
   capacity for macroalgae to fill a global carbon sequestration niche,
   both as managed natural carbon pools and as deployable carbon capture
   assets.

   uses the combustion of biomass after biocrude extraction is the most
   favorable one in energy terms. In particular, 2 cases of this type were
   addressed and compared to a Base case where all energy requirements
   (heat and electrical) are provided from external sources: Case 1,
   electricity is supplied externally whereas the biomass and part of the
   biocrude produced are burned to meet the requirements of thermal energy,
   and Case 2, where the energy recovered from both biomass and part of
   biocrude are used to fulfill all heat and electricity duties. These
   cases were analyzed also when the nitrogen needed for microalgae growth
   is obtained from wastewaters. Favorable EROEI figures could be
   calculated.

AB Microalgae are organisms whose biomass contains different biomolecules,
   such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, pigments, vitamins, minerals,
   and antioxidant compounds, with numerous industrial applications,
   highlighting the food, nutritional, cosmetic, pharmacological, and
   biofuel segments. However, access to these biomolecules in an integrated
   manner is often hampered due to the structural rigidity of their cell
   wall, requiring the application of a pre-treatment that promotes cell
   lysis. Various cell rupture techniques applied to microalgae biomass
   have been reported. These methods can be mechanical, especially ball
   milling techniques and high-pressure homogenization (HPH), or
   non-mechanical, such as chemical, thermal, and enzymatic procedures,
   each with advantages and disadvantages. Thus, this review addressed the
   different methods of cell disruption, listing their advantages and
   disadvantages, applications in cell biomass, and challenges.

SO Frontiers in Microbiology
VL 13

AB The traditional approach for biodegradation of organic matter in sewage
   treatment used a consortium of bacterial spp. that produce untreated or
   partially treated inorganic contaminants resulting in large amounts of
   poor-quality sludge. The aeration process of activated sludge treatment
   requires high energy. So, a sustainable technique for sewage treatment
   that could produce less amount of sludge and less energy demanding is
   required for various developed and developing countries. This led to
   research into using microalgae for wastewater treatment as they reduce
   concentrations of nutrients like inorganic nitrates and phosphates from
   the sewage water, hence reducing the associated chemical oxygen demand
   (COD). The presence of microalgae removes nutrient concentration in
   water resulting in reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and toxic
   heavy metals like Al, Ni, and Cu. Their growth also offers opportunity
   to produce biofuels and bioproducts from algal biomass. To optimize use
   of microalgae, technologies like high-rate algal ponds (HRAPs) have been
   developed, that typically use 22% of the electricity used in Sequencing
   Batch Reactors for activated sludge treatment with added economic and
   environmental benefits like reduced comparative operation cost per cubic
   meter, mitigate global warming, and eutrophication potentials. The
   addition of suitable bacterial species may further enhance the treatment
   potential in the wastewater medium as the inorganic nutrients are
   assimilated into the algal biomass, while the organic nutrients are
   utilized by bacteria. Further, the mutual exchange of CO2 and O2 between
   the algae and the bacteria helps in enhancing the photosynthetic
   activity of algae and oxidation by bacteria leading to a higher overall
   nutrient removal efficiency. Even negative interactions between algae
   and bacteria mediated by various secondary metabolites (phycotoxins)
   have proven beneficial as it controls the algal bloom in the eutrophic
   water bodies. Herein, we attempt to review various opportunities and
   limitations of using a combination of microalgae and bacteria in
   wastewater treatment method toward cost effective, eco-friendly, and
   sustainable method of sewage treatment.

AB Saline wastewater contains numerous pollutants such as nutrients, heavy
   metals, micropollutants, and organic pollutants. This kind of wastewater
   needs to be treated prior to discharging. Compared to other technologies
   for saline wastewater treatment, the microalgae process is considered to
   be 'green' or environmentally friendly as it generates no secondary
   pollutants and creates profit. To elucidate the issue, this review
   investigated the following: (1) the nature of saline wastewater; (2)
   adaptation of microalgae in saline wastewater; (3) pollutants'
   remediation by microalgae in saline wastewater; (4) comparisons with
   other technologies; and (5) future perspectives. Most importantly,
   during microalgae process, the saline wastewater is transformed from a
   waste into a source for biofuel and pigment production. This trend
   implies to heal the environment, cut remediation expenses and raise
   revenue.

AB In this modern era due to multidimensional problems associated with
   petrochemical fuels, the scientific community is showing a burgeoning
   interest in microalgae due to their potential applications which are
   indispensable for economic amelioration. Microalgae are a fundamental
   source of oils and various other biomolecules that can be used in the
   production of biofuels and various other value-added bioproducts.
   However, implication of microalgae-based biofuels is not economically
   viable due to various factors. One of these prime reasons is the cost
   associated with its harvesting. This review focuses on various
   harvesting techniques applied to microalgae in the last 2/3 decades,
   presenting the main benefits and drawbacks of each method to allow the
   selection of appropriate method(s) for economically harvesting
   microalgal biomass. According to this review, use of any single
   technique is not viable for harvesting microalgal biomass. However,
   keeping in view the morphological characteristics of the microalgae,
   growth density, utility purpose of the harvested biomass, harvesting
   scale and physico-chemical characteristics of the production medium,
   these techniques should be applied in suitable combinations to obtain
   fruitful results.

AB Climate change due to increasing CO2 emissions from industries with
   severe environmental pollution from wastewater due to rising global
   population and production plants. Current approaches in treating
   wastewater and flue gases are expensive processes requiring high
   operating costs. Hence, efficient strategies to utilize flue gases and
   simultaneously treat wastewater is in desperate need to tackle the
   current situation. One of the potential solutions is to cultivate
   microalgae-bacteria consortium using industrial flue gas and wastewater,
   where the nutrients and organic matters within flue gas and wastewater
   are consumed for the growth of microalgae-bacteria consortium. The
   production of biomass from the consortium can be further transformed
   into sources of biofuel, valuable metabolites and animal feed. This
   review explores the mechanisms of CO2 mitigation and phycoremediation
   through microalgae-bacteria consortium along with possible future
   prospects.

AB Microalgae have received increasing attentions due to its capacity of
   carbon fixation and serving as feedstock for producing biofuels and
   other value-added products. Microalgae can be used to remediate
   wastewater for simultaneously nutrient removal and biomass production,
   thereby significantly lowering the costs of microalgal feedstock.
   Recently, converting microalgal biomass biochar is of particular
   interest since biochar has numerous opportunities in application. In
   this review, innovative methods developed for microalgae-based
   wastewater treatment are described. Conventional and novel technologies
   used for producing biochar from microalgal biomass, such as pyrolysis
   and hydrothermal approaches, are presented. Future challenges and
   potential applications of the biochar derived from microalgal biomass
   collected from wastewater treatment system (e.g., soil amendment or
   adsorbent) are also discussed.

AB Microalgae have been considered a promising and sustainable candidate
   for wastewater treatment and valuable bioproducts, such as feedstocks
   for food, nutrients, and energy. However, many challenging bottlenecks,
   such as low biomass productivity, expensive biomass harvesting
   techniques, and inefficient extraction of biofuels restrict its
   large-scale commercial production. Symbiotic relationships between
   microalgae and bacteria, also known as microalgal consortia, have proven
   to be effective solutions for mitigating technical and economic
   limitations. The natural and artificial symbiotic microalgal consortia
   combine microorganisms with various metabolic activities, which leads to
   valuable biomass production and the removal of nutrients,
   pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCP) from wastewater. Many
   microalgal consortia have been applied for various wastewater treatments
   with reduced energy costs and higher efficiency in recovering valuable
   resources. In this study we review the present research status and
   prospects of microalgal consortia, emphasizing the associated mechanism
   of microalgae consortia cooperative symbiosis and its studies on diverse
   environmental and biotechnological applications.

AB Nowadays, microalgae received wide attention due to several advantages
   for biochemicals and renewable/sustainable biofuels production.
   Moreover, the utilization of microalgae as robust cellular species for
   biological nutrient removal from industrial and domestic wastewater
   streams has been of great research interest amongst the several
   biotechnological applications of microalgae. This is due to the capacity
   for effective photosynthetic uptake of high concentrations of minerals,
   ionogens, and organics by microalgae whilst simultaneously
   biosequestering carbon dioxide. This review discusses the utilization of
   microalgae for wastewater nutrients removal. It discusses the bioprocess
   potentials and challenges of using microalgal cells for full-scale
   microbial wastewater treatment under free and immobilized conditions. It
   also presents a mechanistic insight of the mass transfer processes
   essential for optimal uptake of nutrients during photobioreaction. A new
   bioprocess paradigm based on integrated upstream and downstream
   processes for multi-purpose microalgae bioprocessing and bioresource
   generation is discussed.

AB Biohydrogen (BioH2) is considered as one of the most environmentally
   friendly fuels and a strong candidate to meet the future demand for a
   sustainable source of energy. Presently, the production of BioH2from
   photosynthetic organisms has raised a lot of hopes in the fuel industry.
   Moreover, microalgal-based BioH2synthesis not only helps to combat
   current global warming by capturing greenhouse gases but also plays a
   key role in wastewater treatment. Hence, this manuscript provides a
   state-of-the-art review of the upstream and downstream BioH2production
   processes. Different metabolic routes such as direct and indirect
   photolysis, dark fermentation, photofermentation, and microbial
   electrolysis are covered in detail. Upstream processes (e.g. growth
   techniques, growth media) also have a great impact on BioH2productivity
   and economics, which is also explored. Technical and scientific
   obstacles of microalgae BioH2systems are finally addressed, allowing the
   technology to become more innovative and commercial.

AB Undernutrition is an important global health problem, especially in
   children and older adults. Both reversal of maternal and child
   undernutrition and heathy ageing have become United Nations-supported
   global initiatives, leading to increased attention to nutritional
   interventions targeting undernutrition. One feasible option is
   microalgae, the precursor of all terrestrial plants. Most commercially
   farmed microalgae are photosynthetic single-celled organisms producing
   organic carbon compounds and oxygen. This review will discuss commercial
   opportunities to grow microalgae. Microalgae produce lipids (including
   omega-3 fatty acids), proteins, carbohydrates, pigments and
   micronutrients and so can provide a suitable and underutilised
   alternative for addressing undernutrition. The health benefits of
   nutrients derived from microalgae have been identified, and thus they
   are suitable candidates for addressing nutritional issues globally. This
   review will discuss the potential benefits of microalgae-derived
   nutrients and opportunities for microalgae to be converted into food
   products. The advantages of microalgae cultivation include that it does
   not need arable land or pesticides. Additionally, most species of
   microalgae are still unexplored, presenting options for further
   development. Further, the usefulness of microalgae for other purposes
   such as bioremediation and biofuels will increase the knowledge of these
   microorganisms, allowing the development of more efficient production of
   these microalgae as nutritional interventions.

AB The autotrophic forms of microalgae are referred to as "efficient
   biological factories", because they play a significant role in
   CO2removal from the atmosphere by utilizing it for the process of
   photosynthesis. The industrial application of microalgae biomass
   includes the production of cosmetics, health products, fertilisers,
   biofuel, feeds, and food. Microalgae biomass is also an important tool
   used in the treatment of wastewater. The current review is aimed at
   reviewing the progress and prospects of microalgae resource modelling
   and optimisation as a tool for sustainable biotechnology. The mechanism
   of biomass production by microalgae tends to vary according to whether
   the microalgae are autotrophic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic organisms.
   In the current study, the modelling and optimisation of microalgae
   biomass production were discussed, as well as the modelling of
   CO2sequestration, light intensity, nutrients, and photobioreactor. The
   role of microalgal biomass production in attaining sustainable
   biotechnology has also been extensively studied. Microalgae are an
   emerging tool used in the phycoremediation of wastewater and reduction
   of high CO2level. The modelling and optimisation of microalgae biomass
   production will help to upscale the production of the microalgal based
   fuel and bioproducts from model scale to the money-making level.

   top of the list of renewable energy solutions. It is not possible to
   separate these energy issues from environmental and sustainability
   concerns. Developing sustainable practices is essential for the
   continued expansion of countries' and the world's energy resources. The
   capacity to transition into new market models rapidly and efficiently is
   a critical source of sustained competitive advantage and leverage for
   increasing biofuel microalgae production sustainability. Given the
   issue's importance, the causes of failure are mostly unknown, and there
   is only a limited thorough description of the sustainable business model
   innovation process in the literature. This study conducts a
   comprehensive review of the literature on the idea and technique of
   sustainable innovation in the microalgae business model. Multiple
   process phases of sustainable business model creation are described with
   a thorough list of major difficulties and obstacles connected with each
   step of the process. This study also looks into how management tools may

AB The design of new food products and increased agricultural activities
   have produced a diversity of waste streams or by-products that contain a
   high load of organic matter. The underutilization of these streams
   presents a serious threat to the environment and to the financial
   viability of the agricultural sector and the food industry. Oleaginous
   microorganisms, such as yeast and microalgae, have been used to convert
   the organic matter present in many agricultural waste streams into an
   oil-rich biomass. Filamentous fungi are promising oleaginous
   microorganisms because of their high lipid accumulation potential and
   simple biomass recovery, the latter being related to their pellet-like
   growth morphology in submerged cultivation. This review highlights the
   use of oleaginous filamentous fungi to convert food by-products into
   value-added components, including the effect of cultivation conditions
   on biomass yield and composition. Special attention is given to
   downstream processing for the commercial production of fungal oil. Also
   discussed are innovative techniques to optimize the biomass oil yield
   and to minimize the challenges associated with biomass harvesting and
   oil extraction at industrial scale.

   full-scale implementation. Finding an integrated approach that covers
   concepts of engineering, green chemistry and the application of
   microbial anabolism driven towards the harvesting processes, is
   mandatory for the widespread establishment of full-scale microalgae
   wastewater treatment plants. By using nature-based substances and
   applying concepts of chemical functionalization in already established
   harvesting methods, the costs of harvesting processes could be reduced
   while preventing microalgae biomass contamination. Moreover, microalgae
   produced during wastewater treatment have unique culture
   characteristics, such as the consortia, which are primarily composed of
   microalgae and bacteria, that should be accounted for prior to
   downstream processing. The aim of this review is to examine recent
   advances in microalgal biomass harvesting and recovery in wastewater
   treatment systems, considering the impact of consortia variability. The
   costs of available harvesting technologies, such as
   coagulation/flocculation, coupled to sedimentation and differential air
   flotation, are provided. Additionally, promising technologies are
   discussed, including autoflocculation, bioflocculation, new filtration
   materials, nanotechnology, microfluidic and magnetic methods.

AB Microalgae biomass has been considered as a potential feedstock for the
   production of renewable chemicals and biofuels. Microalgae culture
   combined with wastewater treatment is a promising approach to improve
   the sustainability of the business model. However, algae culture and
   harvest account for the majority of the high costs, hindering the
   development of the microalgae-based wastewater utilization.
   Cost-effective culture systems and harvesting methods for enhancing
   biomass yield and reducing the cost of resource recovery have become
   extremely urgent and important. In this review, different commonly used
   culture systems for microalgae are discussed; the current harvesting
   methods with different culture systems have also been evaluated. Also,
   the inherent characteristics of inefficiency in algae wastewater
   treatment are elaborated. Current literature collectively supports that
   a biofilm type device is a system designed for higher biomass
   productivity, and offers ease of harvesting, in small-scale algae
   cultivation. Additionally, bio-flocculation, which uses one kind of
   flocculated microalgae to concentrate on another kind of non-flocculated
   microalgae is a low-cost and energy-saving alternative harvesting
   method. These findings provide insight into a comprehensive
   understanding of integrated culture systems and harvesting methods for
   microalgae-based wastewater treatment.

AB Water is the most valuable resource on the planet. However, massive
   anthropogenic activities generate threatening levels of biological,
   organic, and inorganic pollutants that are not efficiently removed in
   conventional wastewater treatment systems. High levels of conventional
   pollutants (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus), emerging chemical
   contaminants such as antibiotics, and pathogens (namely
   antibiotic-resistant ones and related genes) jeopardize ecosystems and
   human health. Conventional wastewater treatment systems entail several
   environmental issues: (i) high energy consumption; (ii) high CO2
   emissions; and (iii) the use of chemicals or the generation of harmful
   by-products. Hence, the use of microalgal systems (entailing one or
   several microalgae species, and in consortium with bacteria) as
   environmental agents towards wastewater treatment has been seen as an
   environmentally friendly solution to remove conventional pollutants,
   antibiotics, coliforms and antibiotic resistance genes. In recent years,
   several authors have evaluated the use of microalgal systems for the
   treatment of different types of wastewater, such as agricultural,
   municipal, and industrial. Generally, microalgal systems can provide
   high removal efficiencies of: (i) conventional pollutants, up to 99%,
   99%, and 90% of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and/or organic carbon,
   respectively, through uptake mechanisms, and (ii) antibiotics frequently
   found in wastewaters, such as sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin,
   trimethoprim and azithromycin at 86%, 65%, 42% and 93%, respectively,
   through the most desirable microalgal mechanism, biodegradation.
   Although pathogens removal by microalgal species is complex and very
   strain-specific, it is also possible to attain total coliform and
   Escherichia coli removal of 99.4% and 98.6%, respectively. However,
   microalgal systems' effectiveness strongly relies on biotic and abiotic
   conditions, thus the selection of operational conditions is critical.
   While the combination of selected species (microalgae and bacteria),
   ratios and inoculum concentration allow the efficient removal of
   conventional pollutants and generation of high amounts of biomass (that
   can be further converted into valuable products such as biofuels and
   biofertilisers), abiotic factors such as pH, hydraulic retention time,
   light intensity and CO2/O2 supply also have a crucial role in
   conventional pollutants and antibiotics removal, and wastewater
   disinfection. However, some rationale must be considered according to
   the purpose. While alkaline pH induces the hydrolysis of some
   antibiotics and the removal of faecal coliforms, it also decreases
   phosphates solubility and induces the formation of ammonium from
   ammonia. Also, while CO2 supply increases the removal of E. coli and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the microalgal growth (and thus the
   conventional pollutants uptake), it decreases Enterococcus faecalis
   removal. Therefore, this review aims to provide a critical review of
   recent studies towards the application of microalgal systems for the
   efficient removal of conventional pollutants, antibiotics, and
   pathogens; discussing the feasibility, highlighting the advantages and
   challenges of the implementation of such process, and presenting current
   case-studies of different applications of microalgal systems.

AB Microalgae are being promoted as a superior alternative feedstock for
   sustainable biofuel production and recently they are also being
   increasingly recognized as phytoremediation agents in bioremediation.
   Other than these, microalgae have been utilized as a sustainable feed in
   aquaculture for many years. The success of microalgae as a feed is based
   on the nutritional quality of microalgae, which are rich in protein,
   carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial
   biologically active components such as carotenoids and polyunsaturated
   fatty acids. Standards for the evaluation of microalgae include the
   assessment of various qualities such as digestibility, bioavailability,
   and toxicity analysis. This review provides comprehensive information
   regarding the current status and desirable characteristics of microalgae
   as a feed ingredient. Feed quality assessments such as protein quality,
   toxicological and microbiological analysis for microalgae are discussed.
   The techno-functional components of microalgae are presented in the feed
   perspective. The utilization of microalgae in various animal husbandry
   sectors and aquaculture are summarized. The advantages - disadvantages
   of microalgae as a feed is also presented, along with future research
   prospects. In short, this review will provide an overall view of the
   nutritional quality of microalgae and its beneficial application as a
   sustainable feed ingredient.

AB Photosynthetic microalgae have promise as biofuel feedstock. Under
   certain conditions, they produce substantial amounts of neutral lipids,
   mainly in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs), which can be converted to
   fuels. Much of our current knowledge on the genetic and molecular basis
   of algal neutral lipid metabolism derives mainly from studies of plants,
   i.e. seed tissues, and to a lesser extent from direct studies of algal
   lipid metabolism. Thus, the knowledge of TAG synthesis and the cellular
   trafficking of TAG precursors in algal cells is to a large extent based
   on genome predictions, and most aspects of TAG metabolism have yet to be
   experimentally verified. The biofuel prospects of microalgae have raised
   the interest in mechanistic studies of algal TAG biosynthesis in recent
   years and resulted in an increasing number of publications on lipid
   metabolism in microalgae. In this review we summarize the current
   findings on genetic, molecular and physiological studies of TAG
   accumulation in microalgae. Special emphasis is on the functional
   analysis of key genes involved in TAG synthesis, molecular mechanisms of
   regulation of TAG biosynthesis, as well as on possible mechanisms of
   lipid droplet formation in microalgal cells.

AB The unique metabolic capabilities and fast growth rates of microalgae
   render them promising candidates for various industrial applications,
   such as biofuel production, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and
   wastewater treatment. Metabolic engineering is a powerful approach used
   to enhance the sustainable production of high-value compounds in
   microalgae, improve their stress tolerance, growth characteristics and
   suitability for large-scale cultivation. This review provides a snapshot
   of the current state of knowledge on omics and metabolic engineering
   research to further enhance our understanding on microalgal metabolism
   and enable the development of optimized strains with improved
   productivity and functionality. More specifically, it focuses on the
   recent breakthroughs in microalgal omics, driven by advancements in
   genomics technologies, such as improved sequencing platforms and
   bioinformatics tools, that have enabled the functional characterization
   of key genes, identification of metabolic pathways, and elucidation of
   microalgae cell physiology. Conventional and state-of-the-art genetic
   engineering approaches used in the last decades to manipulate the
   metabolic pathways of microalgae in a targeted manner, are highlighted
   in the scope of microalgal optimization. In this review, the different
   applications of genetic engineering and their impact on microalgae
   industry are also discussed. Integrating pan-omics data in future
   research is crucial for predicting novel functional interactions and
   identifying aspects of metabolic flux, towards enhancing algal

AB Fossil fuel depletion and global warming are key issues to look for
   renewable and eco friendly sources of energy. Currently, microalgae are
   gaining increasing interest as a feedstock for production of bio fuels.
   The reasons for this are their renewability, higher photosynthesis
   efficiency, high lipid content, biodegradability, and non competition
   for farmlands and generating acceptable quality exhaust gases. This
   paper presents an overview of various perspectives of microalgal
   biofuels as a renewable source of energy.

TI Peracetic acid is a suitable disinfectant for recirculating
   fish-microalgae integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems.
SO Aquaculture Reports
VL 4
PS 136-142
PY 2016
U1 2
U2 20
AB Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is a promising direction for
   the sustainable development of aquaculture. Microalgae have good
   potential to be integrated with recirculating aquaculture systems
   because they can use the nitrogen excreted from fish and share the same
   optimal pH value as in aquaculture. As a byproduct, the microalgae
   biomass can be used for fish feed or biofuel. However, the recirculating
   fish-microalgae IMTA system is under constant threat from fish pathogens
   and phytoplankton-lytic bacteria. Therefore, it is necessary to apply
   proper disinfectants as prophylaxis or treatment which are effective
   against these threats, but safe to fish and microalgae. For this
   purpose, peracetic acid (PAA) is a valid option because it is highly
   effective against fish pathogens and bacteria at low concentrations and
   degrades spontaneously to harmless residues. In the present study, we
   exposed the culture of a marine microalgaeTetraselmis chuiionce per day
   for four days to four PAA products with differing hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2)/PAA proportions at two concentrations (1 and 2 mg L-1PAA). The
   H2O2solutions at equivalent total peroxide (H2O2+PAA) concentrations
   were tested in parallel. The results show that the growth and
   photosynthesis ofT. chuiiwere not affected by three of the PAA products
   (Wofasteril E400, Wofasteril E250 and Applichem 150) and equivalent
   H2O2solutions at both concentrations. In contrast, Wofasteril Lspez and
   an equivalent H2O2solution at both concentrations caused irreversible
   culture collapse, photosynthesis dysfunction and irreversible cell
   damage. In conclusion, PAA products with low proportions of H2O2are
   optimal disinfectants for fish-microalgae IMTA systems.

AB Today's world faces the dual pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission
   reduction and an energy crisis. Microalgae, which can use solar energy
   to convert CO2to organic matter, have emerged as a promising and
   renewable cell factory for producing nutrients, biofuels, and various
   high value-added compounds (HVACs). They possess numerous advantages,
   such as high photosynthetic efficiency, fast growth rate, and use of
   agro-industrial waste and nonagricultural land for cultivation.
   Microalgae can also effectively remove eutrophic elements (e.g.,
   nitrogen and phosphorus) from wastewater and atmospheric pollutants
   (e.g., SOxand NOx) from flue gas, thus providing great environmental
   benefits. However, microalgae-based production often faces low
   productivity, limiting applicability in industrial settings. Genetic and
   metabolic modifications of certain microalgal strains have proven
   effective in improving productivity. Here, we review the latest
   developments regarding the microalgae-based production of platform
   compounds, biofuels, and other HVACs. Although still in the early
   exploration stage, the rapid development of gene editing tools, a deeper
   understanding of the metabolic pathways of microalgae and their
   regulatory mechanisms, and further optimization of cultivation
   procedures and photosynthetic efficiency can eventually enable the
   launch of microalgae-based biomanufacturing for green industrial
   production. Therefore, this technology is strategically important for
   solving the current energy crisis problems of excessive CO2emissions and
   environmental pollution. This review provides information about the
   advancement and development of microalgae-based production over the past
   two decades and discusses possible future directions in the field.

AB Environmental control is essential for a steady economic upswing and
   advancement. The application of microorganism for the removal of
   pollutants from environment provide cheaper substitutes to the
   traditional treatment methods. The selection of easily culturable and
   effective microorganism that could do the treatment is a major
   challenge. Microalgae present a viable, eco-friendly and economical
   agent of wastewater treatment and production of value-added substances
   such as biofuel, carotenoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   pharmaceuticals and dyeing agents. In this article, we reviewed and
   presented the use of microalgae for the removal of several kinds of
   pollutants, the mechanisms employed for the degradation and their
   diversity in wastewater. The removal of pollutants such as nitrogen,
   phosphate, heavy metal, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand
   and dye by different strains as well as the mechanism involved were
   identified and discussed. Cultivation of microalgae in the large-scale
   void of bloom, mechanism of stress tolerance and the potential
   value-added substances to be produced while decontaminating the
   environment concomitantly were also highlighted. The article also
   highlighted the fate of organic pollutants in the application of
   microalgae biomass. This review demonstrated the use of microalgae for
   wastewater treatment to be a win-win strategy that has dual role of
   pollutants removal and multiple product formations. Such benefits can be
   enhancing via integrating multiple methods of treatments and microalgae
   engineering.

AB There is increasing commercial interest in the cultivation of microalgae
   for the production of biofuels, foods, pharmaceuticals, and wastewater
   treatment. Light is one of the most important factors for the growth and
   product yield from photosynthetic cells. In this review, light transfer
   and photosynthesis in algal cells, and the issues of light utilization
   in the cultivation of microalgae in photobioreactor (PBR) are discussed.
   Research progress on the improvement of light utilization in microalgae
   cultivation is outlined. In addition, PBR design assisted by
   computational fluid dynamics and a strong focus on improving the light
   characteristics in the scale-up of PBRs is emphasized.

AB The biological treatment of source-separated human urine to produce
   biofuel, nutraceutical, and high-value chemicals is getting increasing
   attention. Especially, photoautotrophic microalgae can use human urine
   as media to achieve environmentally and economically viable large-scale
   cultivation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the
   up-to-date advancements in microalgae cultivation employing urine in
   photobioreactors (PBRs). The standard matrices describing algal growth
   and nutrient removal/recovery have been summarized to provide a platform
   for fair comparison among different studies. Specific consideration has
   been given to the critical operating factors to understand how the PBRs
   should be maintained to achieve high efficiencies. Finally, we discuss
   the perspectives that emphasize the impacts of co-existing bacteria,
   contamination by human metabolites, and genetic engineering on the
   practical microalgal biomass production in urine.

   and their roles in promoting human health have been extensively studied,
   other lipid types from this resource, such as phytosterols, have been
   poorly explored. Phytosterols have been used as additives in many food
   products such as spread, dairy products and salad dressing. This review
   focuses on the recent advances in microalgae-derived phytosterols with
   functional bioactivities and their potential applications in functional
   food and pharmaceutical industries. It highlights the importance of
   microalgae-derived lipids other than PUFA for the development of an

AB The rise in global population has led to explorations of alternative
   sources of energy and food. Because corn and soybean are staple food
   crops for humans, their common use as the main source of dietary energy
   and protein for food-producing animals directly competes with their
   allocation for human consumption. Alternatively, de-fatted marine
   microalgal biomass generated from the potential biofuel production may
   be a viable replacement of corn and soybean meal due to their high
   levels of protein, relatively well-balanced amino acid profiles, and
   rich contents of minerals and vitamins, along with unique bioactive
   compounds. Although the full-fatted (intact) microalgae represent the
   main source of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids including
   docohexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the de-fatted
   microalgal biomass may still contain good amounts of these components
   for enriching DHA/EPA in eggs, meats, and milk. This review is written
   to highlight the necessity and potential of using the de-fatted
   microalgal biomass as a new generation of animal feed in helping address
   the global energy, food, and environmental issues. Nutritional
   feasibility and limitation of the biomass as the new feed ingredient for
   simple-stomached species are elaborated. Potential applications of the
   biomass for generating value-added animal products are also explored.

AB Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic organisms capable of producing
   high-value metabolites like carbohydrates, lipids, proteins,
   polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, pigments, and other high-value
   metabolites. Microalgal biomass gained more interest for the production
   of nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, therapeutics, food supplements,
   feed, biofuel, bio-fertilizers, etc. due to its high lipid and other
   high-value metabolite content. Microalgal biomass has the potential to
   convert trapped solar energy to organic materials and potential
   metabolites of nutraceutical and industrial interest. They have higher
   efficiency to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) and subsequently convert it into
   biomass and compounds of potential interest. However, to make microalgae
   a potential industrial candidate, cost-effective cultivation systems and
   harvesting methods for increasing biomass yield and reducing the cost of
   downstream processing have become extremely urgent and important. In
   this review, the current development in different microalgal cultivation
   systems and harvesting methods has been discussed.

AB Novel compounds can be found in marine creatures, many of which have
   amazing biotechnological capabilities. Microalgae, in particular, have a
   drawn interest as a potential basis for new industrial creation routes.
   Many biologically active compounds, such as antioxidants,
   immunostimulants, antivirals, antibiotics, hem agglutinates,
   polyunsaturated fatty acids, peptides, proteins, biofuels, and pigments,
   are derived from these species. Recently, there has been a rise in
   interest in microalgal biotechnology to create beneficial, sustainable,
   and ecologically friendly bioproducts. Microalgae biomass is in high
   demand for a wide range of potential uses, most of which are now the
   subject of ongoing research. Microalgae are important groups of
   photosynthetic organisms that use light and carbon dioxide more
   efficiently than terrestrial plants to produce biomass and use it for
   biotechnological purposes such as environmental protection, biofuel
   production, pharmaceutical production, human food supplements, animal
   feed components, coronavirus treatments, and so on. This paper presents
   an overview of current advancements in the application of microalgal
   biotechnology in several industries.

AB The production of biofuels from microalgae requires efficient
   photobioreactors in order to meet the tight constraints of energy
   efficiency and economic profitability. Current cultivation systems are
   designed for high-value products rather than for mass production of
   cheap energy carriers. Future bioreactors will imply innovative
   solutions in terms of energy efficiency, light and gas transfer or
   attainable biomass concentration to lower the energy demand and cut down
   production costs. A new generation of highly developed reactor designs
   demonstrates the enormous potential of photobioreactors. However, a net
   energy production with microalgae remains challenging. Therefore, it is
   essential to review all aspects and production steps for optimization
   potential. This includes a custom process design according to production
   organism, desired product and production site. Moreover, the potential
   of microalgae to synthesize valuable products additionally to the
   energetic use can be integrated into a production concept as well as
   waste streams for carbon supply or temperature control.

AB Despite the great interest in microalgae as a potential source of
   biofuel to substitute for fossil fuels, little information is available
   on the effects of bacterial symbionts in mass algal cultivation systems.
   The bacterial communities associated with microalgae are a crucial
   factor in the process of microalgal biomass and lipid production and may
   stimulate or inhibit growth of biofuel-producing microalgae. In
   addition, we discuss here the potential use of bacteria to harvest
   biofuel-producing microalgae. We propose that aggregation of microalgae
   by bacteria to achieve >90% reductions in volume followed by
   centrifugation could be an economic approach for harvesting of
   biofuel-producing microalgae. Our aims in this review are to promote
   understanding of the effects of bacterial communities on microalgae and
   draw attention to the importance of this topic in the microalgal biofuel
   field.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) from ethanol production facilities is increasing as
   more ethanol is produced for alternative transportation fuels. CO2
   produced from ethanol fermentation processes is of high purity and is
   nearly a saturated gas. Such highly-concentrated source of CO2 is a
   potential candidate for capture and utilization by the CO2 industry.
   Quantity, quality and capture of CO2 from ethanol fermentations are
   discussed in this review. The established and emerging value-added
   opportunities and markets for CO2 from ethanol plants also are reviewed.
   The majority of CO2 applications are dedicated to serving carbonated
   beverage and food processing and preservation markets. Beyond
   traditional merchant markets, the potential for exploring some fresh and
   profitable markets are discussed including carbon sources in chemical
   industries for the following: enhanced oil recovery; production of
   chemicals, fuels, and polymers; and production of algae-based biofuels
   through CO2 fixation by microalgae.

AB Drying microalgae is an important step in optimising their use in
   numerous industrial sectors since it reduces moisture content while
   conserving vital components. This method is very important for
   increasing the economic viability and sustainability of microalgae,
   which are known for their remarkable flexibility and bioactive chemical
   synthesis. Efficient drying processes protect the integrity of bioactive
   chemicals like antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and anticancer
   compounds, as well as essential macronutrients like proteins, lipids,
   and carbs. Furthermore, drying preserves moisture-sensitive chemicals,
   improves shelf life, and concentrates lipids, making microalgae more
   appropriate for use in biofuels, pharmaceuticals, functional foods,
   cosmetics, and biotechnology. Despite microalgae's immense potential,
   market size and sustainability concerns remain, emphasising the need for
   constantly improving drying technology. This extensive study to a better
   understanding of the changing landscape of microalgae research,
   emphasising the critical significance of drying procedures in maximising
   the utility of microalgae in various industrial applications.

AB The development of clean and renewable biofuels has been of wide concern
   on the topic of energy and environmental issues. As a kind of biomass
   energy with great application prospects, microalgae have many advantages
   and are used in the fields of environmental protection and biofuels as
   well as food or feed production for humans and animals. However, the
   high cost of microalgae harvesting is the main bottleneck of industrial
   production on a large scale. Self-flocculation is a cost-efficient and
   promising method for harvesting microalgal biomass. This article briefly
   describes the current commonly used technology for microalgae
   harvesting, focusing on the research progress of self-flocculation. This
   article explores the relative mechanisms and influencing factors of
   self-flocculation and discusses a proposal for the integration of algae
   cultivation and harvesting as well as the co-cultivation of algae and
   bacteria in an effort to provide a reference for microalgae harvesting
   with high efficiency and low cost.

AB Diatoms are microalgae well known for their high variability and high
   primary productivity, being responsible for about 20% of the annual
   global carbon fixation. Moreover, they are interesting as potential
   feedstocks for the production of biofuels and high-value lipids and
   carotenoids. Diatoms exhibit trophic flexibility and, under certain
   conditions, they can grow mixotrophically by combing photosynthesis and
   respiration. So far, only a few species of diatoms have been tested for
   their mixotrophic metabolism; in some cases, they produced more biomass
   and with higher lipid content when grown under this condition.
   Phaeodactylum tricornutum is the most studied diatom species for its
   mixotrophic metabolism due to available genome sequence and molecular
   tools. However, studies in additional species are needed to better
   understand the conservation of this process in diatoms and its potential
   in industrial applications. Here, we describe the photosynthetic and
   respiratory pathways involved in mixotrophy and provide an overview of
   the trophic variability in diatoms. This review also highlights
   promising areas of industrial applications for diatoms when cultivated
   under mixotrophy.

AB Currently, algae and algae products are extensively applied in the
   pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries. Algae are the main
   organisms that take up and store heavy metals. Therefore, the use of
   compounds derived from algae by the pharmaceutical industry should be
   closely monitored for possible contamination. The pollution generated by
   heavy metals released by industrial and domestic sources causes serious
   changes in the aquatic ecosystem, resulting in a loss of biological
   diversity and a magnification and bioaccumulation of toxic agents in the
   food chain. Since algae are at the bottom of the aquatic food chain,
   they are the most important vector for transfer of pollution to upper
   levels of the trophic chain in aquatic environments. Moreover,
   microalgae are also used for the bioremediation of wastewater, a process
   that does not produce secondary pollution, that enables efficient
   recycling of nutrients and that generates biomass useful for the
   production of bioactive compounds and biofuel.

AB CRISPR-Cas has revolutionized genetic modification with its comparative
   simplicity and accuracy, and it can be used even at the genomic level.
   Microalgae are excellent feedstocks for biofuels and nutraceuticals
   because they contain high levels of fatty acids, carotenoids, and other
   metabolites; however, genome engineering for microalgae is not yet as
   developed as for other model organisms. Microalgal engineering at the
   genetic and metabolic levels is relatively well established, and a few
   genomic resources are available. Their genomic information was used for
   a "safe harbor" site for stable transgene expression in microalgae. This
   review proposes further genome engineering schemes including the
   construction of sgRNA libraries, pan-genomic and epigenomic resources,
   and mini-genomes, which can together be developed into synthetic biology
   for carbon-based engineering in microalgae. Acetyl-CoA is at the center
   of carbon metabolic pathways and is further reviewed for the production
   of molecules including terpenoids in microalgae.

AB The use of microalgae for wastewater treatment has recently attracted
   increased interest due to the effective nutrient removal abilities of
   such microorganism, and additional benefits of biofuel production.
   Microalgae also have the advantages of high growth rates, high cellular
   lipid productivities, capability to bio-sequester carbon dioxide,
   capability to remove pollutants from wastewater and their abilities to
   produce biofuels and bio-based chemicals. However, large scale,
   cost-effective and sustainable microalgae biofuel production remains
   still uncertain. In this review, the pathway of integrating wastewaters
   (including palm oil mill effluent (POME), sewage and landfill leachate)
   as the medium for microalgal cultivation is comprehensively discussed.
   The technology/potential of using microalgae to remove pollutants from
   wastewaters as well as converting the resulting microalgal biomass for
   biofuel production, are critically reviewed.

AB Microalgae have the potential to become microbial cell factories for
   lipid production. Their ability to convert sunlight and CO2 into
   valuable lipid compounds has attracted interest from cosmetic, biofuel,
   food and feed industries. In order to make microalgae-derived products
   cost-effective and commercially competitive, enhanced growth rates and
   lipid productivities are needed, which require optimization of
   cultivation systems and strain improvement. Advances in genetic tool
   development and omics technologies have increased our understanding of
   lipid metabolism, which has opened up possibilities for targeted
   metabolic engineering . In this review we provide a comprehensive
   overview on the developments made to genetically engineer microalgal
   strains over the last 30 years. We focus on the strategies that lead to
   an increased lipid content and altered fatty acid profile. These include
   the genetic engineering of the fatty acid synthesis pathway, Kennedy
   pathway, polyunsaturated fatty acid and triacylglycerol metabolisms and
   fatty acid catabolism . Moreover, genetic engineering of specific
   transcription factors, NADPH generation and central carbon metabolism,
   which lead to increase of lipid accumulation are also reviewed.

AB In recent years attention has been focused on the utilization of
   microorganisms as alternatives for industrial and nutritional
   applications. Considerable research has been devoted to techniques for
   growth, extraction, and purification of high-value lipids for their use
   as biofuels and biosurfactants as well as high-value metabolites for
   nutrition and health. These successes argue that the elucidation of the
   mechanisms underlying the microbial biosynthesis of such molecules,
   which are far from being completely understood, now will yield
   spectacular opportunities for industrial scale biomolecular production.
   There are important additional questions to be solved to optimize the
   processing strategies to take advantage of the assets of microbial
   lipids. The present review describes the current state of knowledge
   regarding lipid biosynthesis, accumulation, and transport mechanisms
   present in single-cell organisms, specifically yeasts, microalgae,
   bacteria, and archaea. Similarities and differences in biochemical
   pathways and strategies of different microorganisms provide a diverse
   toolset to the expansion of biotechnologies for lipid production. This
   paper is intended to inspire a generation of lipid scientists to
   insights that will drive the biotechnologies of microbial production as
   uniquely enabling players of lipid biotherapeutics, biofuels,
   biomaterials, and other opportunity areas into the 21st century.

AB Microalgae are definitely on the way to become a sustainable,
   fast-growing natural green source for highly demanded market products.
   Research is currently looking at promising outstanding applications of
   microalgae among which are the production of biofuels from the fatty
   acids present in biomass, functional foods enriched with microalgae
   healthy bioactive molecules, and greenhouse gas mitigation
   (CO2consuming) based on high cell density microalgae cultures
   technology. Besides, other traditional microalgae applications are
   currently increasing in competitiveness in a growing market demand for
   green biomass, in which microalgae are widely recognized as a healthy,
   sustainable, and biological renewable resource. Among these traditional
   applications, microalgae are being used to improve the nutritional
   quality in animal feed, particularly in aquaculture, therapeutic agent
   source, and antioxidant activity. In addition, microalgae also show to
   be functional in waste effluents treatment to remove N and P, thus
   preventing eutrophication, heavy metals, and others contaminants. This
   review intends to offer a comprehensive overview of basic aspects of
   microalgae physiology, massive production of biomass, and current fields
   of applications at industrial scale.

AB Despite being more popular for biofuel, microalgae have gained a lot of
   attention as a source of biomolecules and biomass for feed purposes.
   Algae farming can be established using land as well as sea and
   strategies can be designed in order to gain the products of specific
   interest in the optimal way. A general overview of the contributions of
   Algae to meet the requirements of nutrients in animal/aquaculture feed
   is presented in this study. In addition to its applications in
   animal/aquaculture feed, algae can produce a number of biomolecules
   including astaxanthin, lutein, beta-carotene, chlorophyll,
   phycobiliprotein, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs), beta-1,3-glucan,
   and pharmaceutical and nutraceutical compounds which have been reviewed
   with respect to their commercial importance and current status. The
   review is further extended to highlight the adequate utilization of
   value added products in the feeds for livestock, poultry and aquaculture
   (with emphasis in shrimp farming).

AB Driven by increasing food security concerns, microalgae have drawn
   attention due to their resource-efficient production and high
   nutritional value. Microalgae are highly diverse and contain significant
   amounts of various bioactive compounds, including bioactive peptides,
   PUFA, vitamins, phenolics, carotenoids, sterols, and so on. These
   bioactive compounds can exhibit considerable health promoting effects,
   such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antimicrobial
   effects. In parallel, research into bioavailability is being conducted
   to support and guide the application of these compounds. Currently, the
   application has been targeted in the food and aquaculture industries,
   with the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and biofuels industries looking to
   apply more microalgae ingredients as well. However, there are still
   obstacles to the commercial application of microalgae due to the
   immaturity of the technology and high production costs. This review
   provides an overview of information on the composition as well as the
   distribution of active substances in microalgae, highlighting the main
   active substance digestion pathways and the corresponding factors
   influencing bioavailability, describing the mechanisms by which
   microalgal bioactive compounds exert a variety of health effects, and
   the development of commercial applications in different industries,
   providing guidance for the development of their potential applications
   and wider consumption.

U2 80
AB Algal blooms have become a major concern in coastal areas and the great
   lakes of the world. Because of their various consequences for aquatic
   ecosystems and resources, algal blooms are called "harmful algal blooms"
   (HABs). HABs often become severely detrimental when they involve one or
   more toxin-producing microalgae of various taxonomic origins. The
   accumulation of algal biomass also has deleterious effects on the
   ecological status of water. However, appropriate management strategies
   can allow the beneficial utilization of these events by consuming the
   biomass feedstock in the production of valuable biocommodities,
   including biofuels, functional food ingredients, UV-absorbing compounds,
   pharmaceutical products, etc. However, if the algal biomass can be
   harvested prior to the onset of their death phase, nutrients (carbon,
   nitrogen, and phosphorus) can also be removed from the ecosystem by
   harvesting the algal blooms. Great progress has been made in the last
   decade in monitoring and predicting HABs, and a demand is emerging for
   persuasive postevent management policies that focus on the potential
   utilization of these blooms as natural renewable bioresources. This
   review summarizes various potential applications of nuisance algal
   blooms and the need for scientific research into their economic and
   industrial potential. Major algal products with great ecological and
   economic significance and their contemporary global utilization are
   analyzed.

U1 0
U2 0
AB The increasing population growth and rapid urbanization, particularly in
   the developing countries, have significantly contributed to the amount
   and the quality of domestic wastewater. Although in certain cities,
   centralized wastewater treatment facility is available, it mainly aims
   at removing organic substances as the system uses the conventional one.
   Even after the treatment, the effluent is still rich with nutrients
   pollutants, particularly nitrogenous compounds originated from bathrooms
   and kitchens. Consequently, excessive nitrogenous matter in the effluent
   will end up in the water bodies which can lead to eutrophication,
   stimulating algal bloom, changing the balance of organism and degrading
   the water quality. As the conventional wastewater treatment system is
   expensive to invest and operate, an alternative cheaper and reliable
   method for wastewater treatment should be available, meeting the need of
   the developing countries. In recent years many researches have shown
   that microalga have capability of simultaneously reducing organic and
   nitrogenous substances in the wastewater for further developed as
   sources for producing medicines, healthy foods, ingredients, chemicals,
   biofuels, electricity, animal feeds, and many more. In this paper, we
   will review and discuss the potential application of microalgae in
   wastewater treatment, with attention to simultaneously removal of
   organics and nitrogenous substances in wastewater.

VL 31

PS 1-8
PY 2019
U1 5
U2 127
AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions have been repeatedly observed during
   microalgal cultivation and from microalgae-based ecosystems such as
   eutrophic lakes. Various studies have unambiguously demonstrated N2O
   synthesis by axenic unialgal cultures and identified several potential
   microalgal N2O pathways. Based on these data, several studies have also
   reported that N2O emissions during microalgal cultivation (for e.g.,
   biofuel feedstock production) could be significant at large scale. In
   this review, we also conservatively estimate that the currently
   unaccounted N2O emissions from eutrophic lakes alone could yield global
   N2O emissions equating to 18% of the N2O currently accounted from all
   rivers, estuaries, and coastal zones. While these estimates are highly
   uncertain given the lack of knowledge in the area, they support a case
   for improving mechanistic understanding of pathways and key triggers of
   microalgal N2O synthesis considering that (i) microalgae are
   ubiquitously found in natural ecosystems and may be cultivated at a
   massive scale in the future; (ii) N2O synthesis by axenic microalgae
   cultures has been unambiguously demonstrated, and current knowledge
   provides the foundation for six putative N2O synthesis pathways in
   microalgae; (iii) N2O emissions have been repeatedly reported from a
   diverse range of aquatic ecosystems characterized by a high level of
   algal activity; (iv) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does
   not currently consider N2O emissions potentially generated during algal
   blooms or algae cultivation.

PY 2015
U1 20
U2 842
AB Biotechnology of microalgae has gained popularity due to the growing
   need for novel environmental technologies and the development of
   innovative mass-production. Inexpensive growth requirements (solar light
   and CO2), and, the advantage of being utilized simultaneously for
   multiple technologies (e.g. carbon mitigation, biofuel production, and
   bioremediation) make microalgae suitable candidates for several
   ecofriendly technologies. Microalgae have developed an extensive
   spectrum of mechanisms (extracellular and intracellular) to cope with
   heavy metal toxicity. Their wide-spread occurrence along with their
   ability to grow and concentrate heavy metals, ascertains their
   suitability in practical applications of waste-water bioremediation.
   Heavy metal uptake by microalgae is affirmed to be superior to the
   prevalent physicochemical processes employed in the removal of toxic
   heavy metals. In order to evaluate their potential and to fill in the
   loopholes, it is essential to carry out a critical assessment of the
   existing microalgal technologies, and realize the need for development
   of commercially viable technologies involving strategic
   multidisciplinary approaches. This review summarizes several areas of
   heavy metal remediation from a microalgal perspective and provides an
   overview of various practical avenues of this technology. It
   particularly details heavy metals and microalgae which have been
   extensively studied, and provides a schematic representation of the
   mechanisms of heavy metal remediation in microalgae.

TI CO2, NOx and SOx removal from flue gas via microalgae cultivation: a
   critical review.

PS 829-839
PY 2015
U1 14
U2 344
AB Flue gas refers to the gas emitting from the combustion processes, and
   it contains CO2, NOx, SOx and other potentially hazardous compounds. Due
   to the increasing concerns of CO2 emissions and environmental pollution,
   the cleaning process of flue gas has attracted much attention. Using
   microalgae to clean up flue gas via photosynthesis is considered a
   promising CO2 mitigation process for flue gas. However, the impurities
   in the flue gas may inhibit microalgal growth, leading to a lower
   microalgae-based CO2 fixation rate. The inhibition effects of SOx that
   contribute to the low pH could be alleviated by maintaining a stable pH
   level, while NOx can be utilized as a nitrogen source to promote
   microalgae growth when it dissolves and is oxidized in the culture
   medium. The yielded microalgal biomass from fixing flue gas CO2 and
   utilizing NOx and SOx as nutrients would become suitable feedstock to
   produce biofuels and bio-based chemicals. In addition to the removal of
   SOx, NOx and CO2, using microalgae to remove heavy metals from flue gas
   is also quite attractive. In conclusion, the use of microalgae for
   simultaneous removal of CO2, SOx and NOx from flue gas is an
   environmentally benign process and represents an ideal platform for CO2
   reutilization.

TI Determination of microalgal lipid content and fatty acid for biofuel
   production.

AB Biofuels produced from microalgal biomass have received growing
   worldwide recognition as promising alternatives to conventional
   petroleum-derived fuels. Among the processes involved, the downstream
   refinement process for the extraction of lipids from biomass greatly
   influences the sustainability and efficiency of the entire biofuel
   system. This review summarizes and compares the current techniques for
   the extraction and measurement of microalgal lipids, including the
   gravimetric methods using organic solvents, CO2-based solvents, ionic
   liquids and switchable solvents, Nile red lipid visualization method,
   sulfo-phospho-vanillin method, and the thin-layer chromatography method.
   Each method has its own competitive advantages and disadvantages. For
   example, the organic solvents-based gravimetric method is mostly used
   and frequently employed as a reference standard to validate other
   methods, but it requires large amounts of samples and is time-consuming
   and expensive to recover solvents also with low selectivity towards
   desired products. The pretreatment approaches which aimed to disrupt
   cells and support subsequent lipid extraction through bead beating,
   microwave, ultrasonication, chemical methods, and enzymatic disruption
   are also introduced. Moreover, the principles and procedures for the
   production and quantification of fatty acids are finally described in
   detail, involving the preparation of fatty acid methyl esters and their
   quantification and composition analysis by gas chromatography.

AB Microalgae are used in various biotechnological processes, such as
   biofuel production due to their high biomass yields, agriculture as
   biofertilizers, production of high-value-added products, decontamination
   of wastewater, or as biological models for carbon sequestration. The
   number of these biotechnological applications is increasing, and as
   such, any advances that contribute to reducing costs and increasing
   economic profitability can have a significant impact. Nitrogen fixing
   organisms, often called diazotroph, also have great biotechnological
   potential, mainly in agriculture as an alternative to chemical
   fertilizers. Microbial consortia typically perform more complex tasks
   than monocultures and can execute functions that are challenging or even
   impossible for individual strains or species. Interestingly, microalgae
   and diazotrophic organisms are capable to embrace different types of
   symbiotic associations. Certain corals and lichens exhibit this
   symbiotic relationship in nature, which enhances their fitness. However,
   this relationship can also be artificially created in laboratory
   conditions with the objective of enhancing some of the biotechnological
   processes that each organism carries out independently. As a result, the
   utilization of microalgae and diazotrophic organisms in consortia is
   garnering significant interest as a potential alternative for reducing
   production costs and increasing yields of microalgae biomass, as well as
   for producing derived products and serving biotechnological purposes.
   This review makes an effort to examine the associations of microalgae
   and diazotrophic organisms, with the aim of highlighting the potential
   of these associations in improving various biotechnological processes.

AB Municipal, industrial, livestock and agricultural wastewater that
   contains many organic and inorganic compounds are a potential support
   for the growth of microalgae and algae biomass, which have high
   tolerance level against adverse environmental stresses. Microalgae
   biomass has effective removal abilities of wastewater pollutants such as
   nutrient compounds (they use inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus for their
   growth within very short periods of time, nutrients that otherwise would
   produce water eutrophication), suspended solids, coliform bacteria,
   heavy metals and other harmful chemicals, and decreases the value of
   chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand. Rapid growth rate
   and the ability to thrive even in extreme conditions make the microalgae
   an attractive means for sustainable and low cost wastewater treatment,
   without secondary pollution. Algae were found to further improve the
   final effluent quality through natural disinfection. In addition,
   microalgae consortium cultivated in open ponds for livestock wastewater
   treatment or in photobioreactors is rich in carbohydrates, proteins and
   lipids, which make them an important feedstock for biofuel production.
   This paper presents some of the cultivation methods and the advances in
   phytoremediation of livestock wastewater using microalgae.

AB Industrial microalgae, as a big family of promising producers of
   renewable biomass feedstock, have been commercially exploited for
   functional food, living feed and feed additives, high-value chemicals in
   nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and chemical reagents. Recently,
   microalgae have also been considered as a group that might play an
   important role in biofuel development and environmental protection.
   Almost all current products of industrial microalgae are derived from
   their biomass; however, large amounts of spent cell-free media are
   available from mass cultivation that is mostly unexploited. In this
   contribution we discuss that these media, which may contain a remarkable
   diversity of bioactive substances are worthy to be recovered for further
   use. Obviously, the extracellular metabolites from industrial microalgae
   have long been neglected in the development of production methods for
   valuable metabolites. With the advances in the last ten years, more and
   more structures and properties from extracellular metabolites have been
   identified, and the potential utilization over wide fields is attracting
   attention. Some of these extracellular metabolites can be potentially
   used as drugs, antioxidants, growth regulators or metal chelators. The
   purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the known
   extracellular metabolites from industrial microalgae which might be of
   commercial interest. The attention mainly focuses on the reports of
   extracellular bioactive metabolites and their potential application in
   biotechnology.

AB In this paper we focus on stakeholder views around the development of
   advanced biofuels from microalgae. Research for the development of
   microalgal-derived biofuels was initiated by the US Department of Energy
   (DOE) more than 30 years ago. However, interest in this eco-innovation
   has been growing significantly over the last five years in various
   countries. The high productivity of algae indicates that algal biofuels
   could contribute to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels while avoiding
   the undesired impacts of first generation biofuels. There are still
   numerous challenges that need nevertheless to be addressed. The aim of
   this paper is to explore stakeholder perceptions of the current barriers
   and opportunities associated with this promising emergent technology.

AB Diatoms are the ubiquitous microalgae present all over the world. They
   are specialized organisms on the planet with the cell wall composed of
   opaline-silica ornamented with intricate and striked patterns. They are
   the most prominent as well as successful photosynthetic lower eukaryotes
   plays a vital role in light trapping. The cell wall nanostructured
   frustules enhance the light absorption capacity in the multi-layered
   materials applied as photoanodes. Frustules, the siliceous porous shells
   of diatoms possess architectures with considerable mechanical strength.
   Formation of bio-silica shells, optical and fluidic properties along
   with their flexibility to convert into various nanomaterials have been
   studied by different biologists, physicists and chemists respectively.
   In the process of energy generation, conversion and conservation,
   diatoms play very significant role. Solar fuel is also one of the
   emerging solutions for increasing future energy demands and to come
   across this requirement, photocatalysis with the help of diatom's
   frustules is mostly preferred. Lipid production in diatoms becomes prior
   objective for biotechnologists also triggers the work in metabolic
   engineering since it can be act as an alternative to fossil fuels. Apart
   from these, the fields like wastewater management also use diatoms as a
   unique source. The present article inculcates the diverse usage of
   diatoms in the fields like nanotechnology, biotechnology, environment,
   biochemistry, biophysics, metabolic engineering and many more. Along
   with this, the prior focus is on the diatoms as a potential source of
   nanomaterials, bio-electrolyte and biofuel.

AB Microalgae have been studied as natural resources for a number of
   applications, most particularly food, animal feed, biofuels,
   pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals. In addition to the intracellular
   compounds of interest, microalgae can also excrete various extracellular
   polymeric substances (EPS) into their immediate living environment
   during their life cycle to form a hydrated biofilm matrix. These
   microalgal EPS mainly consist of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic
   acids and lipids. Most notably, EPS retain their stable matrix structure
   and form a 3-D polymer network for cells to interact with each other,
   and mediate their adhesion to surfaces. EPS also play a role as
   extracellular energy and carbon sinks. They are also abundant source of
   structurally and compositionally diverse biopolymers which possess
   unique bioactivities for special high-value applications, specifically
   as antivirals, antitumor agents, antioxidants, anticoagulants and
   anti-inflammatories. Their superior rheological properties also make
   microalgal EPS particularly useful in mechanical engineering (e.g.,
   biolubricants and drag reducers) and food science/engineering (e.g.,
   thickener and preservatives) applications. The chemical composition and
   structure of EPS appear to correlate with their applications, but the
   fundamentals of such relationship are not well understood. This article
   summarizes previous research on microalgal EPS derived from green algae,
   diatoms and red algae, including compositions/functions/structure,
   production, and potential applications. The importance of
   exopolysaccharides and EPS proteins, with their particular metabolic
   characteristics, are also described because of their potential
   high-value applications. This review concludes with potential future
   research areas of microalgal EPS.

AB While feeding food-producing animals with microalgae was investigated
   several decades ago, this research has been reactivated by the recent
   exploration of microalgae as the third generation of feedstocks for
   biofuel production. Because the resultant defatted biomass contains high
   levels of protein and other nutrients, it may replace a portion of corn
   and soybean meal in animal diets. Our laboratory has acquired 4 types of
   full-fat and defatted microalgal biomass from biofuel production
   research (Cellana, Kailua-Kona, HI) that contain 13.9 to 38.2% crude
   protein and 1.5 to 9.3% crude fat. This review summarizes the safety and
   efficacy of supplementing 2 types of the biomass at 7.5 to 15% in the
   diets of weanling pigs, broiler chicks, and laying hens. Based on their
   responses of growth performance, egg production and quality, plasma and
   tissue biochemical indicators, and/or fecal chemical composition, all 3
   types of animals were able to tolerate the microalgal biomass
   incorporation into their diets at 7.5% (on as-fed basis). Holistic
   analysis is also provided to explore the global potential of using the
   defatted microalgal biomass as a new feed ingredient in offsetting the
   biofuel production cost, reducing the dependence on staple crops such as
   corn and soybeans, decreasing greenhouse gas production of animal
   agriculture, and developing health value-added animal products.

U2 117
AB Microalgal energy storage compounds (carbohydrates, lipids, etc.) can
   serve as renewable feedstocks for biofuels and biobased chemicals.
   Traditional methods of inducing the accumulation of energy storage
   compounds in microalgae, such as abiotic stress (high light intensity,
   high salinity, nutrient limitation, heavy metals, etc.), can affect the
   growth of microalgae and limit their efficient accumulation of energy
   storage materials. Plant hormones are a class of small molecular
   substances that act as chemical messengers to coordinate plant cell
   activities and regulate the physiological and metabolic activities of
   microalgae, including promoting microalgal cell proliferation, improving
   stress resistance, and enhancing photosynthetic activity, thereby
   increasing algal biomass and lipid, chlorophyll and protein content.
   This paper reviews the recent research progress on regulation of the
   accumulation of energy storage compounds in microalgae by adding
   exogenous plant hormones combined with abiotic stress, discusses the
   mechanism of plant hormones regarding the accumulation of energy storage
   compounds in microalgae, and proposes future research needs.

AB Biomass obtained from microalgae research studies gained momentum in
   recent years because of their extensive application potential in
   multiple industries such as high-value nutraceuticals, bioproducts,
   cosmetics, animal feed industries, and biofuels while being a
   sustainable and environmentally friendly option. Although they have high
   biomass yields and rapid growth rates there are some limitations and
   challenges that remain for large-scale commercialized cultivation and
   harvesting methods of microalgae. Since there are multiple pathways
   related to efficient cultivation and harvesting methods to be viable,
   this study adopted, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity
   to Ideal Solution), a multicriteria decision-making tool, to find the
   most acceptable alternative by using excel spreadsheets to evaluate the
   information that is derived from literature and pilot-scale studies. As
   a result, tubular (helical) and plate (flat panel) photobioreactors
   (PBRs) for cultivation and chemical harvesting (with chitosan) and
   bio-flocculation for harvesting were deemed suitable, while plastic bag
   PBR and suspended air flotation were deemed unsuitable.

AB Background: The lack of sequenced genomes for oleaginous microalgae
   limits our understanding of the mechanisms these organisms utilize to
   become enriched in triglycerides. Here we report thede novotranscriptome
   assembly and quantitative gene expression analysis of the oleaginous
   microalgaNeochloris oleoabundans, with a focus on the complex
   interaction of pathways associated with the production of the
   triacylglycerol (TAG) biofuel precursor. Results: After growth under
   nitrogen replete and nitrogen limiting conditions, we quantified the
   cellular content of major biomolecules including total lipids,
   triacylglycerides, starch, protein, and chlorophyll. Transcribed genes
   were sequenced, the transcriptome was assembledde novo, and the
   expression of major functional categories, relevant pathways, and
   important genes was quantified through the mapping of reads to the
   transcriptome. Over 87 million, 77 base pair high quality reads were
   produced on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform. Metabolite
   measurements supported by genes and pathway expression results indicated
   that under the nitrogen-limiting condition, carbon is partitioned toward
   triglyceride production, which increased fivefold over the
   nitrogen-replete control. In addition to the observed overexpression of
   the fatty acid synthesis pathway, TAG production during nitrogen
   limitation was bolstered by repression of the beta-oxidation pathway,
   up-regulation of genes encoding for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
   which funnels acetyl-CoA to lipid biosynthesis, activation of the
   pentose phosphate pathway to supply reducing equivalents to inorganic
   nitrogen assimilation and fatty acid biosynthesis, and the up-regulation
   of lipases - presumably to reconstruct cell membranes in order to supply
   additional fatty acids for TAG biosynthesis. Conclusions: Our
   quantitative transcriptome study reveals a broad overview of how
   nitrogen stress results in excess TAG production inN. oleoabundans, and
   provides a variety of genetic engineering targets and strategies for
   focused efforts to improve the production rate and cellular content of
   biofuel precursors in oleaginous microalgae.

AB Microalgae are rich in lipids, proteins, and exopolysaccharides, serving
   as potential producers of high-value by-products. Compared with
   monoculture, microalgal co-culture offers advantages such as fast growth
   rates and strong resistance, increasing the microalgal biomass and lipid
   production. Biomass production by microalgae co-culture is influenced by
   environmental conditions, nutrient composition, and external stress, and
   the produced biomass can be utilized for biofuel production and food
   processing. This article introduces the types of microalgal co-culture
   systems and reviews the related studies on the production of high-value
   by-products. It summarizes the factors influencing biomass production in
   microalgal co-culture systems and highlights the potential of microalgal
   co-culture for resource utilization. Furthermore, this article discusses
   the prospects and challenges of microalgal co-culture.

AB Microalgal-based processes offer promise for addressing two
   sustainability challenges: recovering phosphorus (P) from wastewater and
   producing biofuel feedstock. This study investigated the role of
   phosphorus supply on microalgal growth, lipid yield, and P distribution
   forScenedesmusduring nitrogen starvation. Extracellular polymeric
   substances and intracellular polymeric substances were the most
   important pools for inorganic phosphorus (IP) and organic phosphorus
   (OP), respectively. The main P pool for microalgae with low phosphorus
   supply was EPS, which accounted for 57% of the total biomass phosphorus;
   while under high P concentrations, 79% of the phosphorus was stored in
   IPS. A high concentration of orthophosphate stimulated rapid P uptake as
   IP and promoted the transformation of IP to OP associating with biomass
   synthesis. The highest P content of microalgal biomass was 6.5% of dry
   weight when the phosphorus concentration in medium was 113 mg/L, and the
   OP content was 4.9% of dry weight. High phosphate-P enhanced the
   biomass's lipid content by 60%, and the distribution of fatty acid
   methyl esters was not altered by P concentrations. Collectively, high
   phosphate-P availability could promote microalgal biomass synthesis,
   lipid production and P accumulation.

AB With the rapid economy development and population surge, the water
   resources available for direct use on the earth have been in shortage.
   Therefore, water pollution remediation inevitably becomes the focus of
   global attention. Aside from their capacity to fix and effectively
   control the emission of carbon dioxide thus achieve negative carbon
   emission, microalgae and its products modified by genetic engineering
   and other technologies also have a broad prospect in sewage treatment
   such as efficiently removing all kinds of pollutants in water and
   producing high-quality biofuels after use. Therefore, research on these
   organisms has gradually deepened in recent years. This paper summarizes
   the bioremediation mechanism of heavy metal ions in water by using
   microalgae and their modified products. The relevant research progresses
   since 2015 are critically reviewed and discussed. Challenges and
   prospects are also put forward for their industrial implementation.

U1 2
U2 35
AB While oilfield produced water (PW) is one of the largest, unclaimed
   wastewater streams of the oil industry, it could potentially be used as
   a cultivation medium for microalgae. Microalgae could help with the
   remediation of this water while also delivering biomass that can be
   transformed into valuable byproducts such as biofuels. The coupling of
   these two purposes is expected to cut production costs of biofuels while
   aiding environmental protection. In this study, we compared the
   cultivation capacity of the marine model diatom Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum in media at varying salinities and in media composed of PW
   from two oilfields in the Central Valley of California that differed
   drastically in the concentration of inorganic and organic constituents.
   Specifically, we measured the carrying capacity of these media, the
   maximum growth rates of P. tricornutum, its cellular lipid accumulation
   capacity, and its capacity to remediate the most polluted PW source. Our
   study shows that P. tricornutum can successfully adjust to the tested
   cultivation media through processes of short-term acclimation and
   long-term adaptation. Furthermore, the cultivation of P. tricornutum in
   the most heavily polluted PW source led to significant increases in cell
   yield and improved photosynthetic capacity during the stationary phase,
   which could be attributed chiefly to the higher levels of nitrate
   present in this PW source. Chemical water analyses also demonstrated the
   capability of P. tricornutum to remediate major nutrient content and
   potentially harmful elements like fluorine and copper. Because P.
   tricornutum is amenable to advanced genetic engineering, which could be
   taken advantage of to improve its cultivation resilience and
   productivity in an economic setting, we propose this study as a step
   towards essential follow-up studies that will identify the genetic
   regulation behind its growth in oilfield PW media and its remediation of
   the PW constituents.

AB Microalgal lipid triacylglycerol (TAG) is a promising source for
   sustainable production of biofuels and edible oils. TAG biosynthesis in
   microalgae can be induced by nitrogen starvation (-N); however,
   regulation of the genes involved in this process is poorly known. To
   explore the regulation of gene encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2
   of oleaginous microalga Neochloris oleoabundans (NeoDGAT2) responsible
   for TAG biosynthesis, regulatory sequence of NeoDGAT2 gene (RDG) was
   cloned, and its functional regions were mapped by deletion analysis
   using the modified cyan fluorescent protein gene (CFP) as a reporter.
   The efficiency of CFP gene mTurquoise2 (Tq) without any intron, Tq1 and
   Tq2 with one and two copies of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rbcS2 intron 1,
   respectively, was evaluated; Tq2 exhibited the highest CFP fluorescence
   activity in N. oleoabundans was therefore used as reporter for RDG
   deletion analysis. Deletion analysis of RDG revealed that the -N
   inducible region contained the predicted binding site of MYB
   transcription factor (MYB-bs). Specific binding between MYB-bs of RDG
   and the DNA-binding domain of MYB-related transcription factor ROC40
   from C. reinhardtii was observed using electrophoretic mobility shift
   assay. Therefore, the corresponding MYB transcription factor in N.
   oleoabundans is probably the transcription factor regulating NeoDGAT2.
   The interaction between MYB transcription factor and the MYB-bs may play
   a role in regulating -N induced expression of NeoDGAT2, affecting TAG
   accumulation. MYB transcription factors can be the potential targets for
   engineering to increase TAG content. Increasing TAG content is essential
   for products derived from microalgal TAG to achieve economic viability.

AB Microalgae have the potential to recycle CO2 as starch and
   triacylglycerol (TAG), which provide alternative source of biofuel and
   high added-value chemicals. Starch accumulates in the chloroplast,
   whereas TAG accumulates in the cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LD).
   Preferential accumulation of starch or TAG may be achieved by switching
   intracellular metabolic carbon flow, but our knowledge on this control
   remains limited. Are these two products mutually exclusive? Or, does
   starch act as a precursor to TAG synthesis, or vice versa? To answer
   these questions, we analyzed carbon flow in starch and lipids using a
   stable isotope 13C in Chlamydomonas debaryana NIES-2212, which
   accumulates, without nutrient limitation, starch in the exponential
   growth phase and TAG in the stationary phase. Pulse labeling experiments
   as well as pulse labeling and chase experiments were conducted, and
   then, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was
   performed on starch-derived glucose and lipid-bound fatty acids. We
   exploited the previously developed method of isotopomer analysis to
   estimate the proportion of various pools with different isotopic
   abundance. Starch turned over rapidly to provide carbon for the
   synthesis of fatty acids in the exponential phase cells. Most fatty
   acids showed rapid and slow components of metabolism, whereas oleic acid
   decayed according to a single exponential curve. Highly labeled
   population of fatty acids that accumulated during the initial labeling
   decreased rapidly, and replaced by low abundance population during the
   chase time, indicating that highly labeled fatty acids were degraded and
   the resulting carbons were re-used in the re-synthesis with about 9-fold
   unlabeled, newly fixed carbons. Elongation of C16-C18 acids in vivo was
   indicated by partially labeled C18 acids. The accumulation of TAG in the
   stationary growth phase was accounted for by both de novo synthesis and
   remodeling of membrane lipids. These results suggest that de novo
   synthesis of starch and TAG was rapid and transient, and also almost
   independent to each other, but there is a pool of starch quickly turning
   over for the synthesis of fatty acids. Fatty acids were also subject to
   re-synthesis. Evidence was also provided for remodeling of lipids,
   namely, re-use of acyl groups in polar lipids for TAG synthesis.

TI Photosynthetic carbon partitioning and metabolic regulation in response

SO Frontiers in Plant Science
VL 11
IS July
PY 2020
U1 2
U2 49
AB Photosynthetic organisms fix inorganic carbon through carbon capture
   machinery (CCM) that regulates the assimilation and accumulation of
   carbon around ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco).
   However, few constraints that govern the central carbon metabolism are
   regulated by the carbon capture and partitioning machinery. In order to
   divert the cellular metabolism toward lipids and/or biorenewables it is
   important to investigate and understand the molecular mechanisms of the
   CO2-driven carbon partitioning. In this context, strategies for
   enhancement of CO2 fixation which will increase the overall biomass and
   lipid yields, can provide clues on understanding the carbon assimilation
   pathway, and may lead to new targets for genetic engineering in
   microalgae. In the present study, we have focused on the physiological
   and metabolomic response occurring within marine oleaginous microalgae
   Microchloropsis gaditana NIES 2587, under the influence of very-low CO2
   (VLC; 300 ppm, or 0.03%) and high CO2 (HC; 30,000 ppm, or 3% v/v). Our
   results demonstrate that HC supplementation in M. gaditana channelizes
   the carbon flux toward the production of long chain polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) and also increases the overall biomass
   productivities (up to 2.0 fold). Also, the qualitative metabolomics has
   identified nearly 31 essential metabolites, among which there is a
   significant fold change observed in accumulation of sugars and alcohols
   such as galactose and phytol in VLC as compared to HC. In conclusion,
   our focus is to understand the entire carbon partitioning and metabolic
   regulation within these photosynthetic cell factories, which will be
   further evaluated through multiomics approach for enhanced
   productivities of biomass, biofuels, and bioproducts (B3).

U1 3
U2 86
AB Sustainability assessments have revealed that integration of CO2 from
   coal-fired flue gas with microalgae cultivation systems could reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions. The technical goal of this integration is to
   utilize exhaust from coal power plants to enhance microalgae cultivation
   processes by capturing and recycling of carbon dioxide from a more toxic
   to a less toxic form. However, heavy metals are also introduced along
   with CO2 to the cultivation system which could contaminate biomass and
   have deleterious effects on products derived from such systems. The
   present study aimed at shedding some light on capability of microalgae
   to sustain their diversity and propagate them under different CO2
   concentrations from coal-fired flue gas. Mixed microalgal culture was
   grown in nutrient rich medium and heavy metals (Al, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn)
   are expected to be introduced from flue gas. Three concentrations (1%,
   3% and 5.5%) of CO2 were evaluated (reference concentrations from flue
   gas). Comparative studies were carried out by flue gas and control
   systems in photobioreactors. Under the 3% CO2 (30% flue gas), the
   highest fraction of B, Mn and Zn were found to be internalized by the
   cells (46.8 9.45 gL-1, 253.6640.62 gL-1 and 355.5 50.69 gL-1
   respectively) during their cultivation period into biomass. Hence,
   microalgae may offer solution to two major challenges: providing
   potential biofuel feedstock for energy security and reducing heavy metal
   pollution to the air.

AB In the microalgaEuglena gracilis, the storage polysaccharide paramylon
   (beta-1,3-D-glucan) is degraded to glucose, and finally converted to wax
   esters under anaerobic conditions. The wax esters and paramylon are now
   considered to be valuable materials for applications in biofuel
   production and in medicine. Genetic improvements of wax esters and
   paramylon accumulation inEuglenawould facilitate their large-scale
   industrial applications; however, such improvements have thus far been
   difficult to realize because the regulatory factors involved in the wax
   ester fermentation pathway remain mostly unknown. Recently, two of
   dual-specificity Tyr phosphorylation-regulated kinases, starch
   degradation 1 (STD1) and triacylglycerol accumulation regulator 1
   (TAR1), have been reported to regulate triacylglycerol metabolism
   inChlamydomonas reinhardtii. In this study, we identified theEuglenaDYRK
   orthologous sequences, and gene-silencing ofEgSTD1andEgSTD2showed an
   increase in accumulation of paramylon and the following anaerobic wax
   ester production. This result indicated that EgSTD1 and EgSTD2 play a
   significant role in regulation of the wax ester fermentation pathway.

AB Background: Flat-panel photo-bioreactors (PBRs) are customarily applied
   for investigating growth of microalgae. Optimal design and operation of
   such reactors is still a challenge due to complex non-linear
   combinations of various impact factors, particularly hydrodynamics,
   light irradiation, and cell metabolism. A detailed analysis of
   single-cell light reception can lead to novel insights into the complex
   interactions of light exposure and algae movement in the reactor.
   Results: The combined impacts of hydrodynamics and light irradiation on
   algae cultivation in a flat-panel PBR were studied by tracing the light
   exposure of individual cells over time. Hydrodynamics and turbulent
   mixing in this air-sparged bioreactor were simulated using the Eulerian
   approach for the liquid phase and a slip model for the gas phase
   velocity profiles. The liquid velocity was then used for tracing single
   cells and their light exposure, using light intensity profiles obtained
   from solving the radiative transfer equation at different wavelengths.
   The residence times of algae cells in defined dark and light zones of
   the PBR were statistically analyzed for different algal concentrations
   and sparging rates. The results indicate poor mixing caused by the
   reactor design which can be only partially improved by increased
   sparging rates. Conclusions: The results provide important information
   for optimizing algal biomass productivity by improving bioreactor design
   and operation and can further be utilized for an in-depth analysis of
   algal growth by using advanced models of cell metabolism.

AB Microalgae technology can play important roles in wastewater management,

   The core challenge is to substantially lower the cultivation and
   harvesting costs. This study assesses performances of batch wise
   photobioreactor (PBR) and sequencing batch membrane photobioreactor
   (SB-MPBR) for polishing real secondary effluent, and at the same time
   producing lipid by cultivating a native strain ofEuglenasp. Lab-scale
   data were used to project large-scale performance of an SB-MPBR and its
   economic potential was compared with established conventional biological
   nutrients removal technologies. Results show that the SB-MPBR with 4
   days retention was found to be optimum in terms of nutrients removal
   (≥95% and ≥70% respectively for total nitrogen and total phosphorous),
   water treatment capacity and lipid yield (≥10%). However, an energy
   audit on the process shows that the chemical energy from the produced
   lipid is still at least 111 fold short of meeting an energy neutral
   process. However, results of preliminary cost analysis indicate that
   SB-MPBR (0.113 $/m3) is highly attractive technology for biological
   nutrients removal than the conventional technologies (0.65-0.96 $/m3).

AB The current scenario in renewable energy is focused on development of
   alternate and sustainable energy sources, amongst which microalgae
   stands as one of the promising feedstock for biofuel production. It is
   well known that microalgae generate much larger amounts of biofuels in a
   shorter time than other sources based on plant seeds. However, the
   greatest challenge in a transition to algae-based biofuel production is
   the various other complications involved in microalgal cultivation, its
   harvesting, concentration, drying and lipid extraction. Several green
   microalgae accumulate lipids, especially triacylglycerols (TAGs), which
   are main precursors in the production of lipid. The various aspects on
   metabolic pathway analysis of an oleaginous microalgae
   i.e.,Chlamydomonas reinhardtiihave elucidated some novel metabolically
   important genes and this enhances the lipid production in this
   microalgae. Adding to it, various other aspects in metabolic engineering
   using OptFlux and effectual bioprocess design also gives an interactive
   snapshot of enhancing lipid production which ultimately improvises the
   oil yield. This article reviews the current status of microalgal based
   technologies for biofuel production, bioreactor process design, flux
   analysis and it also provides various strategies to increase lipids
   accumulation via metabolic engineering.

AB Microalgae are currently emerging to be very promising organisms for the
   production of biofuels and high-added value compounds. Understanding the
   influence of environmental alterations on their metabolism is a crucial
   issue. Light, carbon and nitrogen availability have been reported to
   induce important metabolic adaptations. So far, the influence of these
   variables has essentially been studied while varying only one or two
   environmental factors at the same time. The goal of the present work was
   to model the cellular proteomic adaptations of the green microalga
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii upon the simultaneous changes of light
   intensity, carbon concentrations (CO2 and acetate), and inorganic
   nitrogen concentrations (nitrate and ammonium) in the culture medium.
   Statistical design of experiments (DOE) enabled to define 32 culture
   conditions to be tested experimentally. Relative protein abundance was
   quantified by two dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis
   (2D-DIGE). Additional assays for respiration, photosynthesis, and lipid
   and pigment concentrations were also carried out. A hierarchical
   clustering survey enabled to partition biological variables
   (proteins+assays) into eight co-regulated clusters. In most cases, the
   biological variables partitioned in the same cluster had already been
   reported to participate to common biological functions (acetate
   assimilation, bioenergetic processes, light harvesting, Calvin cycle,
   and protein metabolism). The environmental regulation within each
   cluster was further characterized by a series of multivariate methods
   including principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions.
   This metadata analysis enabled to highlight the existence of a clear
   regulatory pattern for every cluster and to mathematically simulate the
   effects of light, carbon, and nitrogen. The influence of these
   environmental variables on cellular metabolism is described in details
   and thoroughly discussed. This work provides an overview of the
   metabolic adaptations contributing to maintain cellular homeostasis upon
   extensive environmental changes. Some of the results presented here
   could be used as starting points for more specific fundamental or
   applied investigations.

AB Background: Microalgae biofuel has become the most promising renewable
   energy over the past few years. But limitations still exist because of
   its high cost. Although, efforts have been made in enhancement of lipid
   productivity, the major cost problem in harvesting and oil extraction is
   still intractable. Thus, the idea of fatty acids (FAs) secretion which
   can massively facilitate algae harvesting and oil extraction was
   investigated here. Results: The cDNAs of two long-chain acyl-CoA
   synthetases (LACSs) genes were cloned fromChlamydomonas reinhardtiiand
   named ascracs1andcracs2. They showed different substrate adaptation in
   the yeast complementation experiments.Cracs2could utilize FAs C12:0,
   C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C16:1 and C18:1, whilecrac1could only utilize
   substrate C14:0, C16:1 and C18:1. Knockdown ofcracs1andcracs2inC.
   reinhardtiiresulted in accumulation of intracellular lipids. The total
   intracellular lipids contents of transgenic algae q-15 (knockdown
   ofcracs1) and p-13 (knockdown ofcracs2) were 45 and 55%, respectively
   higher than that of cc849. Furthermore, FAs secretion was discovered in
   both transgenic algae. Secreted FAs can reach 8.19 and 9.66 mg/109cells
   in q-15 and p-13, respectively. Conclusion: These results demonstrated
   the possibility of FAs secretion by microalgae and may give a new
   strategy of low-cost oil extraction. According to our findings, we
   proposed that FAs secretion may also be achieved in other species
   besidesChlamydomonas reinhardtiiby knocking-downcracsgenes, which may
   promote the future industrial application of microalgae biofuels.

AB The importance of algae-derived biofuels has been highlighted by the
   current problems associated with fossil fuels. Considerable past
   research has shown that limiting nutrients such as nitrogen and
   phosphorus increases the cellular lipid content in microalgae. However,
   limiting the supply of nutrients results in decreased biomass, which in
   turn decreases the overall lipid productivity of cultures. Therefore,
   nutrient limitation has been a subject of dispute as to whether it will
   benefit biofuel production on an industrial scale. Our research explores
   the physiological changes a cell undergoes when exposed to nitrogen and
   phosphorus limitations, both individually and in combination, and also
   examines the biotechnological aspects of manipulating N and P in order
   to increase cellular lipids, by analyzing the lipid production. We show
   that nitrogen starvation and also nitrogen plus phosphorus starvation
   combined have a more profound effect on the physiology and
   macromolecular pools of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii than does phosphorus
   starvation alone. The photosynthetic performance of C. reinhardtii
   underwent drastic changes under nitrogen starvation, but remained
   relatively unaffected under phosphorus starvation. The neutral lipid
   concentration per cell was at least 2.4-fold higher in all the
   nutrient-starved groups than the nutrient-replete controls, but the
   protein level per cell was lower in the nitrogen-starved groups.
   Overall, nitrogen starvation has a more dramatic effect on the
   physiology and neutral lipids and protein levels of C. reinhardtii than
   phosphorus starvation. However, the level of total lipids per volume of
   culture obtained was similar among nutrient-replete and all of the
   nutrient-starved groups. We conclude that combined nitrogen and
   phosphorus starvation does not likely benefit biofuel production in
   terms of enhanced lipid or biomass production.

AB High feedstock price is an important barrier for microalgae pyrolysis to
   alternative biofuels, while high ash content and low heat value affect
   the stable operation of sewage sludge pyrolysis reactors. Co-pyrolysis
   of microalgae and sewage sludge can avoid the drawbacks in individual
   sludge pyrolysis and improve pyrolysis performances. For better
   understanding co-pyrolysis kinetics, biocrude characteristics and
   interaction of sewage sludge and microalgae, thermogrametric analysis
   (TGA) and fixed pyrolysis bed experiment have been conducted and carbon
   distribution and components in biocrude were evaluated based on quality
   and quantity. For TGA, there was nearly no difference between individual
   pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis below 550°C, while obvious interaction was
   found from 550°C to 700°C in co-pyrolysis. According to analysis of
   co-pyrolysis kinetics, solid-phase decomposition reaction mechanism in
   sewage sludge individual pyrolysis turned into random nucleation and
   subsequent growth mechanism above 550°C. For co-pyrolysis, there was a
   yield increase of C4 and C7 and a yield decrease of C9 in carbon
   distribution. Detailed comparison of biocrude composition and carbon
   distribution indicated interaction in the product of co-pyrolysis.
   Excellent linear relationship between H/C of feedstocks and pyrolysis
   char was observed. Co-pyrolysis products reduced in hydrocarbons and
   N-containing compounds but increased in ketones and aldehyde.
   Co-pyrolysis with microalgae biomass was superior to pyrolysis
   individual with sewage sludge, which could improve stable operation of
   sewage sludge pyrolysis system due to higher heat value of microalgae
   addition. Co-pyrolysis of microalgae and sewage sludge is a promising
   way to decrease feedstock cost and realize alternative fuel production.

AB The great phylogenetic diversity of microalgae is corresponded by a wide
   arrange of interesting and useful metabolites. Nonetheless metabolic
   engineering in microalgae has been limited, since specific
   transformation tools must be developed for each species for either the
   nuclear or chloroplast genomes. Microalgae as production platforms for
   metabolites offer several advantages over plants and other
   microorganisms, like the ability of GMO containment and reduced costs in
   culture media, respectively. Currently, microalgae have proved
   particularly well suited for the commercial production of omega-3 fatty
   acids and carotenoids. Therefore most metabolic engineering strategies
   have been developed for these metabolites. Microalgal biofuels have also
   drawn great attention recently, resulting in efforts for improving the
   production of hydrogen and photosynthates, particularly
   triacylglycerides. Metabolic pathways of microalgae have also been
   manipulated in order to improve photosynthetic growth under specific
   conditions and for achieving trophic conversion. Although these pathways
   are not strictly related to secondary metabolites, the synthetic biology
   approaches could potentially be translated to this field and will also
   be discussed.

AB Harvesting microalgae at large scales is a significant barrier to
   economically feasible production of biofuels and other low-cost
   commodities from microalgal biomass. We have tested a strategy for
   reducing the costs of microalgal harvest by generating transgenic
   strains ofChlamydomonas reinhardtiithat express a heterologous cellular
   adhesion molecule, Algal-CAM, from the multicellular green algaVolvox
   carteri. Constitutive expression of heterologous Algal-CAM
   causesChlamydomonasunicells to adhere together and settle out of
   suspension much more rapidly than controls. Immunoblotting shows the
   heterologous Algal-CAM to be present in the extracellular matrix
   ofChlamydomonastransformants and possibly cross-linked with native
   glycoproteins there. We define this form of cell-cell adhesion as
   genetically engineered (GE) flocculation to distinguish it from other
   cell flocculation strategies. Future development of this trait can
   include making expression of Algal-CAM inducible for controlled timing
   of GE flocculation and exploring regulated expression of additional cell
   adhesion molecules from the many other multicellular relatives
   ofChlamydomonas. Advanced forms of this technology could lead to
   production of novel biomaterials from single-celled algae by controlled
   expression of diverse cell adhesion molecules with different
   cross-linking properties.

AB Many microalgae are reported to accumulate TAG under high concentrations
   of bicarbonate and nitrogen deficiency, but their physiological
   responses remain unknown and the associated applied technology is rarely
   explored. We found that single high concentration of bicarbonate did not
   enhance lipid content, except when combined with nitrogen limitation
   inDesmodesmussp. NMX451, and the lipid contents obtained were
   independent from nitrogen limitation and alkalinity stress. Further
   analysis showed that adding bicarbonate not only retarded the cell
   cycle, repressed starch accumulation but also promoted polar lipid
   content. Nitrogen limitation meantime caused protein and chlorophyll
   degradation with a corresponding increase in total lipid content.
   Following the aforementioned insights, combined cultivation was
   performed at an outdoor 5 L scale, and higher biomass and lipid
   productivities were obtained. These results suggest that bicarbonate can
   be used as a "trigger" for rapid lipid accumulation in microalgae during
   nitrogen depletion, and this is an effective new strategy for the
   cultivation of oleaginous microalgae.

AB Lipids from microalgae have become a valuable product with applications
   ranging from biofuels to human nutrition. While changes in fatty acid
   (FA) content and composition under nitrogen limitation are well
   documented, the involved molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.
   Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) is a key enzyme in the FA synthesis and
   elongation pathway. Plastidial and cytosolic ACCases provide malonyl-CoA
   for de novo FA synthesis in the plastid and FA elongation in the
   endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The present study aimed at
   investigating the expression of plastidial and cytosolic ACCase
   inChromera veliaandIsochrysisaff.galbana(TISO) and their impact on FA
   content and elongation level when grown under nitrogen-deplete
   conditions. InC. velia, plastidial ACCase was significantly upregulated
   during nitrogen starvation and with culture age, strongly correlating
   with increased FA content. Conversely, plastidial ACCase
   ofI.aff.galbanawas not differentially expressed in nitrogen-deplete
   cultures, but upregulated during the logarithmic phase of
   nitrogen-replete cultures. In contrast to plastidial ACCase, the
   cytosolic ACCase ofC. veliawas downregulated with culture age and
   nitrogen-starvation, strongly correlating with an increase in
   medium-chain FAs. In conclusion, the expression of plastidial and
   cytosolic ACCase changed with growth phase and nutrient status in a
   species-specific manner and nitrogen limitation did not always result in
   FA accumulation.

AB There has been renewed interest in the combined use of high-rate algal
   ponds (HRAP) for wastewater treatment and biofuel production. Successful
   wastewater treatment requires year-round efficient nutrient removal
   while high microalgal biomass yields are required to make biofuel
   production cost-effective. This paper investigates the year-round
   performance of microalgae in a 5-ha demonstration HRAP system treating
   primary settled wastewater in Christchurch, New Zealand. Microalgal
   performance was measured in terms of biomass production, nutrient
   removal efficiency, light absorption and photosynthetic potential on
   seasonal timescales. Retention time-corrected microalgal biomass
   (chlorophyll a) varied seasonally, being lowest in autumn and winter
   (287 and 364 mg m-3 day-1, respectively) and highest in summer (703 mg
   m-3 day-1), while the conversion efficiency of light to biomass was
   greatest in winter (0.39 mg Chl- a per mol) and lowest in early summer
   (0.08 mg Chl- a per mol). The percentage of ammonium (NH4-N) removed was
   highest in spring (79%) and summer (77%) and lowest in autumn (47%) and
   winter (53%), while the efficiency of NH4-N removal per unit biomass was
   highest in autumn and summer and lowest in winter and spring.
   Chlorophyll-specific light absorption per unit biomass decreased as
   total chlorophyll increased, partially due to the package effect,
   particularly in summer. The proportional increase in the maximum
   electron transport rate from winter to summer was significantly lower
   than the proportional increase in the mean light intensity of the water
   column. We concluded that microalgal growth and nutrient assimilation
   was constrained in spring and summer and carbon limitation may be the
   likely cause.

AB Three experiments were conducted to determine if defatted diatom
   Staurosira sp. biomass (DFA) (Cellana, Kailua-Kona, HI, USA) from
   biofuel production could replace a portion of soybean meal (SBM) and
   (or) corn in diets for broiler chicks. In experiment 1, 2-day-old chicks
   were fed diets with DFA at 0% (control), 7.5% replacing SBM, or 7.5 and
   10% replacing SBM and corn. Chicks fed the DFA-containing diets had
   lower body weight gain (P<0.05) than the controls in the starter period.
   Two follow-up experiments, experiments 2 and 3, indicated that
   supplementing the 7.5% DFA diet (replacing SBM) with amino acids, but
   not exogenous protease or electrolytes, restored growth performance of
   chicks to the control levels. Responses of plasma and liver biomarkers
   and gross examination of digestive tract showed no toxicity of DFA. In
   conclusion, DFA could substitute for 7.5% of SBM alone, or in
   combination with corn, in diets for broiler chicks when appropriate
   amino acids are added.

AB Microalgae are capable of accumulating high levels of lipids and starch
   as carbon storage compounds. Investigation into the metabolic activities
   involved in the synthesis of these compounds has escalated since these
   compounds can be used as precursors for food and fuel. Here, we detail
   the results of a comprehensive analysis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
   using high or low inorganic carbon concentrations and speciation between
   carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, and the effects these have on inducing
   lipid and starch accumulation during nitrogen depletion. High
   concentrations of CO2 (5%; v/v) produced the highest amount of biofuel
   precursors, transesterified to fatty acid methyl esters, but exhibited
   rapid accumulation and degradation characteristics. Low CO2 (0.04%; v/v)
   caused carbon limitation and minimized triacylglycerol (TAG) and starch
   accumulation. High bicarbonate caused a cessation of cell cycling and
   accumulation of both TAG and starch that was more stable than the other
   experimental conditions. Starch accumulated prior to TAG and then
   degraded as maximum TAG was reached. This suggests carbon reallocation
   from starch-based to TAG-based carbon storage.

   supply. Microalgal production systems remain the subject of controversy
   however, generally consisting of arguments about the economic and
   environment sustainability of these systems. We discuss these aspects
   and draw some parallels with other systems to highlight real advantages
   and obstacles to expanding the modern microalgal industry. Emerging
   alternative production models and the relatively early developmental
   state of the microalgal biofuels industry provide room for extensive
   innovation that has the potential to bring the technology to a highly

AB The global demand for biomass for food, feed, biofuels, and chemical
   production is expected to increase in the coming decades. Microalgae are
   a promising new source of biomass that may complement agricultural
   crops. Production of microalgae has so far been limited to high-value
   applications. In order to realize large-scale production of microalgae
   biomass for low-value applications, new low-cost technologies are needed
   to produce and process microalgae. A major challenge lies in the
   harvesting of the microalgae, which requires the separation of a low
   amount of biomass consisting of small individual cells from a large
   volume of culture medium. Flocculation is seen as a promising low-cost
   harvesting method. Here, we overview the challenges and possible
   solutions for flocculating microalgae.

AB Innovative technologies and sources of energy must be developed to
   replace fossil fuels and contribute to the reductions of emissions of
   greenhouse gases associated with their use. In this perspective, algal
   biofuels are generating substantial awareness in many countries. As of
   today, it has been shown that it is scientifically and technically
   possible to derive the desired energy products from algae in the
   laboratory. The question lies, however, in whether it is a technology
   that merits the support and development to overcome existing scalability
   challenges and make it economically feasible. In this context, the
   overall purpose of this study is to provide an integrated assessment of
   the potential of microalgae as a source to produce biofuels, while
   confronting it with competing emerging biofuel technologies. It is
   intended to provide a comprehensive state of technology summary for
   producing fuels from algal feedstocks and to draw some insights upon the
   feasibility and technoeconomic challenges associated with scaling up of
   processes.

AB High biomass productivity and efficient harvesting are currently
   recognized challenges in microbial biofuel applications. To produce
   naturally settleable biomass, combined growth of native microalgae and
   bacteria was facilitated in laboratory sequencing batch reactors (SBRs)
   using primary treated wastewater from the Christchurch Wastewater
   Treatment Plant (CWTP) in New Zealand. SBRs were operated under a
   simulated, local, summer climate (i.e., 925 mol/m2/s of
   photosynthetically active radiation for 14.7 h per day at 21°C mean
   water temperature) using 1.4- to 8-day hydraulic retention times (HRTs)
   to optimize growth. Solids retention times (SRTs) were varied from 4 to
   40 days by discharging different ratios of supernatant and completely
   mixed culture. Biomass productivity up to 31 g/m2/day of solids was
   obtained, and it generally increased as retention times decreased.
   Biomass settleability was typically 70-95%, and the microbes aggregated
   into compact flocs as cultures aged up to four months. Due to a low
   lipid content of 10.5%, anaerobic digestion appeared to be the most
   appropriate biofuel conversion process with potential to generate 19,200
   m3/ha/yr of methane based on settleable mixture productivity.

AB Freshwater shortage and energy crisis are the two major challenges in
   the 21st century. The coupling of wastewater treatment and energy
   production to supply reclaimed water and sustainable energy is a very
   promising approach to handle these two challenges. A novel process of
   domestic wastewater reclamation coupled with biofuel/biomass production
   based on microalgae is proposed in this paper. The organic pollutants in
   wastewater are separated and concentrated by flocculation and
   filtration, and nitrogen and phosphorus are used as nutrients for
   microalgal cultivation. The organics separated and microalgal biomass
   harvested can be further processed to produce biofuel. The novel process
   proposed in this paper will bring about innovation in wastewater
   treatment, and the conventional wastewater treatment process will be
   transformed from a mere "treatment process" to a "production process"
   using wastes as raw materials and thereby can produce biofuel and other
   valuable by-products. At present, this novel process is in the
   conceptual stage, and some key techniques necessary to be further
   studied are also discussed in this paper.

   divided between a functional pool and two storage pools (sugars and
   neutral lipids). The various intracellular carbon flows between these
   pools lead to a complex dynamic with a strong discrepancy between
   synthesis and mobilization of neutral lipids. The model has been
   validated with experiments of Isochrysis aff. galbana (clone T-iso)
   culture under various nitrogen limitation conditions and under nitrogen
   starvation. The hysteresis behavior of the neutral lipid quota observed
   experimentally is accurately predicted.

AB Several obstacles and limitations currently prevent the industrial
   exploitation of microalgae for feed, food and biofuel production.
   Photobioreactors (closed systems for algae cultivation) suffer from
   high-energy expenditures for mixing and cooling, while cultures in
   large-scale open ponds, which have a more favorable net energy ratio,
   are unstable ecosystems in which maintaining selected strains for long
   periods is difficult. Techniques for supplying nutrients and CO2, for
   mixing and for harvesting and processing the biomass in an
   energy-efficient manner are still under study and development. Despite
   these impediments and although microalgae are not superior to higher
   plants in terms of photosynthetic efficiency and productivity,
   microalgal cultures remain one of the most attractive sources of feed,
   food and next-generation biofuels since microalgae can be grown in
   saline or seawater on nonarable lands, can use fertilizers with an
   almost 100% efficiency, are able to attain much higher oil and protein
   yields than traditional crops and, being endowed with high growth rates,
   are easier to be improved via genetic and metabolic engineering.
