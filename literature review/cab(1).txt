AB Treatment of industrial and domestic wastewater is very important to
   protect downstream users from health risks and meet the freshwater
   demand of the ever-increasing world population. Different types of
   wastewater (textile, dairy, pharmaceutical, swine, municipal, etc.) vary
   in composition and require different treatment strategies. Wastewater
   management and treatment is an expensive process; hence, it is important
   to integrate relevant technology into this process to make it more
   feasible and cost-effective. Wastewater treatment using microalgae-based
   technology could be a global solution for resource recovery from
   wastewater and to provide affordable feedstock for bioenergy (biodiesel,
   biohydrogen, bio-alcohol, methane, and bioelectricity) production.
   Various microalgal cultivation systems (open or closed
   photobioreactors), turf scrubber, and hybrid systems have been
   developed. Although many algal biomass harvesting methods (physical,
   chemical, biological, and electromagnetic) have been reported, it is
   still an expensive process. In this review article, resource recovery
   from wastewater using algal cultivation, biomass harvesting, and various
   technologies applied in converting algal biomass into bioenergy, along
   with the various challenges that are encountered are discussed in brief.

TI Effects of water washing and KOH activation for upgrading microalgal

U1 27
U2 74
AB Torrefaction is an effective pathway for microalgal solid biofuel
   upgrading, and alkali metal activation is also an efficient method to
   enhance fuel properties. This study explores the comparison of
   torrefaction alone and KOH activation combined with torrefaction to
   determine a better operation for biochar production from the
   microalgaNannochloropsis Oceanica. The results indicate that the HHV
   ranges of KOH-activated biochar and unactivated biochar are
   25.611-32.792 MJ.kg-1and 25.024-26.389 MJ.kg-1, respectively.
   Furthermore, KOH-activated biochar is better than unactivated biochar,
   with less residue, broader pyrolysis and combustion temperature ranges,
   higher elemental carbon, and less combined carbon. Moreover,
   KOH-activated biochar is close to the unactivated one from the viewpoint
   of expense calculation and life cycle assessment and thus possesses a
   better comprehensive performance. Overall, KOH activation is an
   efficient method for upgrading microalgal solid biofuel. The results are
   conducive to exploring further modification of microalgal solid biofuel
   production with better properties, thus leading to a greener and more
   efficient approach for upgrading fuel performance.

AB Background: Biofuel has been the focus of intensive global research over
   the past few years. The development of 4thgeneration biofuel production
   (algae-to-biofuels) based on metabolic engineering of algae is still in
   its infancy, one of the main barriers is our lacking of understanding of
   microalgal growth, metabolism and biofuel production. Although fatty
   acid (FA) biosynthesis pathway genes have been all cloned and
   biosynthesis pathway was built up in some higher plants, the molecular
   mechanism for its regulation in microalgae is far away from elucidation.
   Results: We cloned main key genes for FA biosynthesis in Haematococcus
   pluvialis, a green microalga as a potential biodiesel feedstock, and
   investigated the correlations between their expression alternation and
   FA composition and content detected by GC-MS under different stress
   treatments, such as nitrogen depletion, salinity, high or low
   temperature. Our results showed that high temperature, high salinity,
   and nitrogen depletion treatments played significant roles in promoting
   microalgal FA synthesis, while FA qualities were not changed much.
   Correlation analysis showed that acyl carrier protein (ACP),
   3-ketoacyl-ACP-synthase (KAS), and acyl-ACP thioesterase (FATA) gene
   expression had significant correlations with monounsaturated FA (MUFA)
   synthesis and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) synthesis. Conclusions: We
   proposed that ACP, KAS, and FATA inH. pluvialismay play an important
   role in FA synthesis and may be rate limiting genes, which probably
   could be modified for the further study of metabolic engineering to
   improve microalgal biofuel quality and production.

AB Biofuels are regarded as one of the most viable options for reduction of
   CO2 emissions in the transport sector. However, conventional plant-based
   biofuels (e.g., biodiesel, bioethanol)'s share of total
   transportation-fuel consumption in 2016 was very low, about 4%, due to
   several major limitations including shortage of raw materials, low CO2
   mitigation effect, blending wall, and poor cost competitiveness.
   Advanced biofuels such as drop-in, microalgal, and electro biofuels,
   especially from inedible biomass, are considered to be a promising
   solution to the problem of how to cope with the growing biofuel demand.
   In this paper, recent developments in oxy-free hydrocarbon conversion
   via catalytic deoxygenation reactions, the selection of and
   lipid-content enhancement of oleaginous microalgae, electrochemical
   biofuel conversion, and the diversification of valuable products from
   biomass and intermediates are reviewed. The challenges and prospects for
   future development of eco-friendly and economically advanced biofuel
   production processes also are outlined herein.

AB Microalgal biofuels are not yet economically viable due to high material
   and energy costs associated with production process. Microalgae
   cultivation is a water-intensive process compared to other downstream
   processes for biodiesel production. Various studies found that the
   production of 1 L of microalgal biodiesel requires approximately 3000 L
   of water. Water recycling in microalgae cultivation is desirable not
   only to reduce the water demand, but it also improves the economic
   feasibility of algal biofuels as due to nutrients and energy savings.
   This review highlights recently published studies on microalgae water
   demand and water recycling in microalgae cultivation. Strategies to
   reduce water footprint for microalgal cultivation, advantages and
   disadvantages of water recycling, and approaches to mitigate the
   negative effects of water reuse within the context of water and energy
   saving are also discussed.

AB Waste-grown microalgae are a potentially important biomass for
   wastewater treatment. The lipid accumulated in microalgae could be
   utilized as feedstocks for biodiesel production. The algal residues, as
   major by-products derived from lipid extraction, mainly consist of
   carbohydrate and protein, making anaerobic digestion an efficient way to
   recover energy. The conversion of lipid-extracted algal residues into
   methane plays dual role in renewable energy production and sustainable
   development of microalgal biodiesel industry. Therefore, an anaerobic
   fermentation process for investigation of the methane production
   potential of algal residues was conducted in this paper. The effect of
   inoculum to substrate ratios (ISRs) on the methane production by
   anaerobic digestion of Chlorella sp. residue in a single stage was
   evaluated. The maximum methane yield of 195.6 ml CH4/g volatile solid
   (VS) was obtained at an ISR of 1:1. The stability and progress of the
   reaction from algal residues to methane were monitored by measuring the
   pH, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), and
   methane volume. Based on the results of one-stage experiments, two-stage
   technology was proposed and was found to be more suitable for high
   organic load. The optimum conditions for acidogenesis and methanogenesis
   are indicated in this paper.

AB Culturing microalgae using natural sunlight is an effective way to
   reduce the cost of microalgae-based biodiesel production. In order to
   evaluate the feasibility of culturing Chlorella zofingiensis outdoors
   for biodiesel production, effects of nitrogen limitation and initial
   cell concentration on growth and lipid accumulation of this alga were
   investigated in 60 L flat plate photobioreactors outdoors. The highest
   max and biomass productivity obtained was 0.994 day-1 and 58.4 mg L-1
   day-1, respectively. The lipid content was much higher (54.5% of dry
   weight) under nitrogen limiting condition than under nitrogen sufficient
   condition (27.3%). With the increasing initial cell concentrations, the
   lipid contents declined, while lipid concentrations and productivities
   increased. The highest lipid content, lipid concentration, and lipid
   productivity obtained was 54.5%, 536 mg L-1 and 22.3 mg L-1 day-1,
   respectively. This study demonstrated that it was possible to culture C.
   zofingiensis under outdoor conditions for producing biodiesel feedstock.

   reported from lipid sources in microalgae Chlorella protothecoides (CP)
   and Neochloris oleoabundans (NOB) with non-traditional oilseeds
   (NTOs)Jatropha curcas(JC) andPongamia pinnata(PP). The first perspective
   has three sections. The first section compares reported processes for
   recovering lipids/biomass from microalgae and NTOs. Two published
   papers. one describing lipid/triacylglycerol recovery from CP and other
   of enhancing TAG in lipids of NOB is discussed in detail with flow
   diagrams in the second section. The third section itemizes quantities of
   lipid/biomass reported from microalgae CP, NOB, enhanced NOB, JC/ PP
   seed oils with a discussion. The second perspective compares listed
   fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from lipids/TAG of microalgae CP, wild
   type, enhanced TAG and JC/PP seed oils. The yield of TAG, FAME
   composition, and comparison of CO2uptake by microalgae and JC/PP
   plantations favors the two NTOs. Since sustainability of JC plantations
   is an issue, growing PP plantations is recommended for its ability to
   capture CO2emitted from coal-fired power stations, fixing N2in the soil,
   and use its detoxified cake as animal feed. Increasing monounsaturation
   in PP seeds, as in transgenic oilseeds, for prospective biodiesel, is
   recommended.

   obliquus which were cultured in secondary effluents from two wastewater
   treatment plants: Tuandao Wastewater Treatment Plant (ETD) and Licun
   River Wastewater Treatment Plant (ELR) were investigated. The results
   showed that both C. aponinum OUC1 and S. obliquus have superior growth
   performances in both undiluted effluents, while the better of them was
   that in ETD effluent, with cell densities of C. aponinum OUC1 and S.
   obliquus increased by 159% and 66% over that of BG11 (control),
   respectively. Regarding nutrient removal, S. obliquus could completely
   remove inorganic phosphorus, and decrease ammonia nitrogen in ETD
   effluent by 81%. In addition, both C. aponinum OUC1 and S. obliquus
   cultivated in ETD exhibited extraordinary potential for biofuel
   production, increasing lipid productivities by 133% and 89% of that
   cultivated in ELR, respectively. As to ultrastructural changes, the
   differences in the lipoidal globules and glycogen granules of S.
   obliquus and C. aponinum OUC1 among the ETD and ELR treatments were
   mostly related to phosphorus limitations. The findings from this
   research reveal the probability using the secondary effluents as
   cultivation media to enhance algal biomass, nutrient removal and lipid
   productivity.

AB Waste valorization is a technology aimed towards the conversion of waste
   materials into commercially applicable products like chemicals,
   materials, and fuels. This technology has revolutionized the field of
   waste management. The 'biorefinery' concept based on biomass-based
   production techniques is pitched to replace oil-based production
   technologies. The current research study combines these principles and
   proposes an organic industrial waste valorization model by biosynthesis
   of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in cyanobacteria Synechococcus
   elongatus. Dairy, sugar industry, fruit industry and biodiesel industry
   waste are used in this study. Our findings show that sugar industry
   waste is the most productive waste media for PHB synthesis and it
   yielded 9.84% of the biopolymer. The PHA inclusions are visualized by
   fluorescent microscopy and the chemical characteristics are studied by
   FTIR and GC-MS analysis. FTIR spectra reveal five peaks at 1178 cm-1,
   1280 cm-1, 1379 cm-1, 1718 cm-1 and 2873 cm-1 corresponding to the
   characteristic chemical groups of PHB. GC-MS spectra show the peak of
   methyl ester derivative of 3-hydroxybutyric acid at Rt 2.6 min based on
   the NIST reference library. It elucidates that the PHB yield is
   influenced by C:N ratio of the waste sample which provides insights on
   making the bioplastics production process productive. The current study
   is significant as it projects an apt substitute for synthetic plastics
   at a low cost and showcases technology for the management of organically
   rich industrial waste. The development of such models will lead to
   environmental improvement and help in achieving the goals of sustainable
   development.

AB Mixotrophic growth of microalgae to boost lipid production is currently
   under active investigation. Such a process could be of practical
   importance if a cheap source of organic carbon, such as waste glycerol
   from biodiesel production, could be used. Several previous studies have
   already demonstrated that this carbon source can be used by different
   indigenous strains of microalgae. In this study it is shown that
   different nitrogen limitation strategies can be applied to further
   increase lipid production during growth with glycerol. In one strategy,
   cultures were grown in nitrogen replete medium and then resuspended in
   nitrogen free medium. In a second strategy, cultures were grown with
   different initial concentrations of nitrate. Lipid production by the two
   microalgal strains used, Chlorella sorokiniana (PCH02) and Chlorella
   vulgaris (PCH05), was shown to be boosted by strategies of nitrogen
   limitation, but they responded differently to how nitrogen limitation
   was imposed.

AB Culturing of microalgae as an alternative feedstock for biofuel
   production has received a lot of attention in recent years due to their
   fast growth rate and ability to accumulate high quantity of lipid and
   carbohydrate inside their cells for biodiesel and bioethanol production,
   respectively. In addition, this superior feedstock offers several
   environmental benefits, such as effective land utilization,
   CO2sequestration, self-purification if coupled with wastewater treatment
   and does not trigger food versus fuel feud. Despite having all these
   'theoretical' advantages, review on problems and issues related to
   energy balance in microalgae biofuel are not clearly addressed until
   now. Base on the maturity of current technology, the true potential of
   microalgae biofuel towards energy security and its feasibility for
   commercialization are still questionable. Thus, this review is aimed to
   depict the practical problems that are facing the microalgae biofuel
   industry, covering upstream to downstream activities by accessing the
   latest research reports and critical data analysis. Apart from that,
   several interlink solutions to the problems will be suggested with the
   purpose to bring current microalgae biofuel research into a new
   dimension and consequently, to revolutionize the entire microalgae
   biofuel industry towards long-term sustainability.

AB Increased world demand for energy and decrease of petroleum reserves
   have focused worldwide efforts to develop new and renewable energy
   sources. Liquid microalgal biofuels such as biodiesel represent a
   sustainable alternative to fossil energy besides being environmentally
   friendly. However, optimization of culture conditions to maximize
   productivity (biomass and lipid) is still a great challenge for a
   commercial biodiesel production. This is due to the difference between
   optimal culture conditions required for biomass and lipid accumulation.
   The current study proposes a two-phase method allowing both biomass and
   lipid increase inDunaliella tertiolecta. The used this method consists
   of a first phase when microalgae were cultivated in presence of
   2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to enhance algal division and
   growth. Later, at the end of log-phase, culture conditions were modified
   by adding NaCl to suddenly increase the salinity from 0.5 M to 2 M.
   Results showed that combination of auxin with salt stress resulted in a
   considerable improvement both in growth and lipid production inD.
   tertiolecta. During the first phase auxin addition improved biomass
   accumulation by 40% and salt stress in the second phase led to lipid
   increase from 24% to 70% with the optimal concentrations combination of
   auxin and NaCl.

U1 5
U2 75
AB Synergistic opportunities to combine biomethane production via anaerobic
   digestion whilst cultivating microalgae have been previously suggested
   in literature. While biomethane is a promising and flexible renewable
   energy vector, microalgae are increasingly gaining importance as an
   alternate source of food and/or feed, chemicals and energy for advanced
   biofuels. However, simultaneously achieving, grid quality biomethane,
   effective microalgal digestate treatment, high microalgae growth rate,
   and the most sustainable use of the algal biomass is a major challenge.
   In this regard, the present paper proposes multiple configurations of an
   innovative Cascading Algal Biomethane-Biorefinery System (CABBS) using a
   novel two-step bubble column-photobioreactor photosynthetic biogas
   upgrading technology. To overcome the limitations in choice of
   microalgae for optimal system operation, a microalgae composition based
   biorefinery decision tree has also been conceptualised to maximise
   profitability. Techno-economic, environmental and practical aspects have
   been discussed to provide a comprehensive perspective of the proposed
   systems.

AB By having the objective of reducing their global emissions of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and their petroleum dependency, many industrialized
   countries like European Union countries support the sustainable
   development and will increase, by 2020, the ratio of biofuel (bioethanol
   or biodiesel) blend with transportation fuel to 10% (v/v). However, this
   objective could deprive the world of arable lands needed to feed 320 to
   460 million people. To replace conventional vegetable oils (for example,
   canola oil) to produce biodiesel, microalgae could be used as the bulk
   material, as their total lipid yield can be as high as 75% (w/w). To
   produce biodiesel, the lipids must previously be extracted from the wet
   microalgae. This study showed that microalgae could be directly
   extracted without dewatering process with a yield of 29.0% (w/w) by
   using boiling pretreatments (water phase). The yield obtained was
   slightly lower than the traditional extraction methods (33.0% w/w)
   implying the costly technique of freeze-drying. The results also showed
   that the chemical physicochemical pretreatment considered had no
   influence on the composition of the fatty acid methyl esters of the
   biodiesel produced with methyl palmitoleate as the major component with
   up to 28.0% (w/w).

AB The aim of present study was to investigate the effects of nitrogen
   limitation as well as sequential nitrogen starvation on morphological
   and biochemical changes in Scenedesmus sp. CCNM 1077. The results
   revealed that the nitrogen limitation and sequential nitrogen starvation
   conditions significantly decreases the photosynthetic activity as well
   as crude protein content in the organism, while dry cell weight and
   biomass productivity are largely unaffected up to nitrate concentration
   of about 30.87 mg/L and 3 days nitrate limitation condition. Nitrate
   stress was found to have a significant effect on cell morphology of
   Scenedesmus sp. CCNM 1077. Total removal of nitrate from the growth
   medium resulted in highest lipid (27.93%) and carbohydrate content
   (45.74%), making it a potential feed stock for biodiesel and bio-ethanol
   production. This is a unique approach to understand morphological and
   biochemical changes in freshwater microalgae under nitrate limitation as
   well as sequential nitrate removal conditions.

AB Promising energy crops such asJatropha curcasLinnaeus (JCL), which are
   planted on marginal lands, or microalgae such asChlorella, which are
   cultivated in ponds located on mudflats or deserts, have been regarded
   with high hopes to solve the shortage of food crops and increase the
   amount of biodiesel (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester, FAME) production. However,
   the annual yields of biomass and transport fuels (t/ha) of both are
   still unclear and often exaggerated in the literature. Large portions
   ofJCLbiomass, including tree trunks and leaves, can also be used to
   generate electricity along with FAME, which is produced from seed
   lipids. Meanwhile, lipid extracted algae (LEA) are composed of proteins,
   polysaccharides, and lipids other than glycerides which are unable to be
   esterified to form FAME and much more abundant in the microalgae than
   oil cake in the oil crops. Therefore, it has been strongly suggested
   that not only transesterification or esterification but also
   Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and bio-electricity generation should be
   considered as routes to produce biofuels. Otherwise, the yield of
   biofuel would be extremely low using eitherJCLorChlorellaas feedstock.
   The Life-Cycle Inventories (LCI) of the biofuel processes with whole
   biomass ofJCLandChlorellawere compared based on their net energy ratio
   (NER) and CO2emission saving (CES). It was shown that the technological
   improvement of irrigation, cultivation, and processing for either
   economic-crops or microalgae were all necessary to meet the requirements
   of commercial biofuel production.

   resource as an eco-fuel to fulfil power requirements for transport. The
   search for third-generation bioethanol feedstock made from marine algae,
   which is sustainable as a feedstock for bioethanol and has positive
   effects on both the environment and food security. The current review
   presents a critical analysis and gives a full description of the
   sequential method for producing bioethanol from macroalgae and derived
   rejects, and recent advances in the production of biofuels using genetic
   engineering. The economic viability of algae-derived biofuel is
   dependent on production costs, which might be reduced by creating
   valuable secondary by-products, which is the goal of current algal
   biofuel research. Clean energy is the primary amenity and making it
   affordable is one of the goals of sustainable development. Achieving
   this with local populations through skill development and training to
   contribute towards Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 7 has been
   explained. Future technologies will harness the cost-effectiveness of
   sustainable bioethanol by having the capability for maximal extraction
   capacity and minimal downstream processing utilizing low-cost feedstock.

AB Algal-derived biodiesel is of particular interest because of several
   factors including: the potential for a near-carbon-neutral life cycle,
   the prospective ability for algae to capture carbon dioxide generated
   from coal, and algae's high per acre yield potential. Our group and
   others have shown that in nitrogen limitation, and for a single species
   ofChlorella, a rise in culture medium pH yields triacylglycerol (TAG)
   accumulation. To solidify and expand on these triggers, the influence
   and interaction of pH and nitrogen concentration on lipid production was
   further investigated on ChlorophyceaeScenedesmussp. andCoelastrellasp.
   Growth was monitored optically and TAG accumulation was monitored by
   Nile red fluorescence and confirmed by gas chromatography. Both
   organisms grew in all treatments and TAG accumulation was observed by
   two distinct conditions: high pH and nitrogen limitation.
   TheScenedesmussp. was shown to grow and produce lipids to a larger
   degree in alkaliphilic conditions (pH>9) and was used to further
   investigate the interplay between TAG accumulation from high pH and/or
   nitrate depletion. Results given here indicate that TAG accumulation per
   cell, monitored by Nile red fluorescence, correlates with pH at the time
   of nitrate depletion.

AB Microalgae are considered to be potentially attractive feedstocks for
   biodiesel production, mainly due to their fast growth rate and high oil
   content accumulated in their cells. In this study, the suitability for
   biofuel production was tested forChlorella vulgaris,Chlorella
   fusca,Oocystis submarina, andMonoraphidiumstrain. The effect of nutrient
   limitation on microalgae biomass growth, lipid accumulation, ash
   content, fatty acid profile, and selected physico-chemical parameters of
   algal biodiesel were analysed. The study was carried out in vertical
   tubular photobioreactors of 100 L capacity. The highest biomass content
   at 100% medium dose was found forMonoraphidium525  29 mg.L-1. A 50%
   reduction of nutrients in the culture medium decreased the biomass
   content by 23% forO. submarina, 19% forMonoraphidium, 13% forC.
   vulgarisand 9% forC. fuscastrain. Nutrient limitation increased lipid
   production and reduced ash content in microalgal cells. The highest
   values were observed forOocystis submarina, with a 90% increase in
   lipids and a 45% decrease in ash content in the biomass under stress
   conditions. The fatty acid profile of particular microalgae strains was
   dominated by palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and linoleic acids. Nutrient
   stress increased the amount of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids
   affecting the quality of biodiesel, but this was determined by the type
   of strain.

AB Background: Using liquid digestate from the biogas industry as a medium
   to culture lipid-producing microalgae is considered mutually beneficial
   for digestate valorization and for reducing the cost of microalgal
   cultivation. However, the low transmittance and high ammonium (NH4+-N)
   levels in liquid digestate negatively influence microalgae growth.
   Results: Struvite precipitation was used to pretreat liquid digestate.
   To obtain struvite-precipitated supernatant with an ideal transmittance,
   NH4+-N concentration, salinity, and N:P ratio for microalgal growth,
   there should be a 1:1.2:1.2 NH4+:Mg2+:PO43-molar ratio in the liquid
   digestate, with KH2PO4and MgCl2added through continuous stirring. The
   addition and stirring was subsequently stopped when the pH reached 8.5.
   Of the nine tested microalgae species,Dictyosphaerium
   ehrenbergianumexhibited the best growth in the supernatant. The biomass
   productivity and lipid content ofD. ehrenbergianumcultured in the
   struvite-precipitated supernatant were 161.06 mg/l/days and 34.33%,
   respectively, which was higher than when cultured in the standard BG-11
   medium. Moreover, the struvite-precipitated supernatant improved the
   accumulation of monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids.
   Conclusions: This study described a new way to combine liquid digestate
   treatment and microalgal biodiesel production. The struvite-pretreated
   liquid digestate can be used to cultureD. ehrenbergianumfor biodiesel
   production.

   drying steps lead to a high cost per litre of fuel. In this context,
   anaerobic digestion of the microalgal biomass after lipid extraction can
   improve the energy balance of the process, by producing methane and
   revalorizing a waste generated during biodiesel production. In this
   study, the production of biogas by anaerobic digestion of the marine
   microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana after oil extraction was studied. As
   the hydrolysis is known to be the rate-limiting step of anaerobic
   digestion of solid substrates, the influence of the process temperature
   on this step was assessed. For this purpose, two different anaerobic
   sludges, i.e. mesophilic (35°C) and thermophilic (55°C), were used as
   inocula for different batch tests and for two continuous anaerobic
   bioreactors. The influence of the oil extraction process on the
   structural integrity of the microalgae was also studied. The results
   obtained from scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry showed
   that the lipid extraction did not cause cell lysis, but the structure of
   their surface was affected by the process. Batch assays showed that
   thermophilic conditions did not improve the biomethane potentials when
   compared to mesophilic conditions. Two continuous anaerobic bioreactors
   operated for 120 days confirmed the batch results. However, measurements
   of the chemical oxygen demand showed that the soluble fraction in the
   thermophilic reactor was higher than under mesophilic conditions,
   indicating an improved hydrolysis step. This was confirmed by the
   results of scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry, which
   suggested a more intense disintegration of microalgae in the
   thermophilic reactor, indicating a greater degree of hydrolysis.
   Nevertheless, this advantage of thermophilic temperatures over
   mesophilic conditions did not improve the methane productivity.

AB Biomass is a valuable renewable energy adapted as an alternative to
   traditional fossil fuels. Apart from fuels, biomass is synthesized into
   highly valuable products that are used in various forms including
   biofuels, biochemical, bioproducts, packing material, and find practice
   in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and nutraceuticals industries.
   Particularly, microalgae a third-generation feedstock known for its rich
   carbon content possesses protein lipids and carbohydrates produces a
   variety of green products such as bioethanol, biohydrogen, biodiesel,
   and biomethane, and also fixes carbon emission to a certain amount in
   the atmosphere. However, microalgae conversion in the presence of a
   catalyst such as a metal-organic framework (MOF) yields high-quality
   valuable products. A MOF is a porous crystalline material where the
   structure and pore size can be controlled making it suitable for
   catalytic reactions and appropriate conversion paths. This review
   briefly explains the prevailing status of microalgae as a sustainable
   biomass and features its components for microalgae biorefinery into
   valuable products and its application in the food industry. MOF
   properties, characteristics and various MOF-based conversion
   technologies for biomass conversion with its application are elaborated.
   In addition, usage of value products produced from microalgae
   biorefinery in the food industry and its importance is elucidated. In
   addition, the challenges in integrating biorefinery processes with food
   industry operations and their solutions are also presented.

AB Cyanobacteria are potential organisms, which are used as food, feed and
   fuel. The unique characters of cyanobacteria include short generation
   times, their ubiquitous presence and efficient nitrogen fixing
   potential. Cyanobacteria are unique organisms performing photosynthesis,
   bioremediation of wastewater, high biomass and biofuel productions etc.
   They are also used in the treatment of industrial and domestic
   wastewaters for the utilization or removal of ammonia, phosphates and
   other heavy metals (Cr, Pb, Co, Cu, Zn). Biomasses of cyanobacteria are
   used as biofertilizers for the improvement of nutrient or mineral status
   and water-holding capacity of the soil. The secondary metabolites of
   cyanobacteria are used in pharmaceuticals, nutraceutical and chemical
   industries. In the industrial sector, value-added products from
   cyanobacteria such as pigments, enzymes and exopolysaccharides are being
   produced in large scales for biomedical and health applications. Age-old
   applications of cyanobacteria in agroecosystems as biofertilizers
   (Anabaena sp; Nostoc sp.) and in industrial sectors as food products
   (Spirulina) have motivated the researchers to come up with much more
   specific applications of cyanobacteria both in agricultural and in
   industrial sectors. Therefore, considering the effectiveness and
   efficiency of cyanobacteria, the present review has enlisted the
   standout qualities of cyanobacteria and their potential applications in
   agricultural and industrial sectors for the benefit of human beings and
   environment.

AB Mass cultivation of microalgae is necessary to achieve economically
   feasible production of microalgal biodiesel, but the high cost of
   nutrients is a major limitation. In this study, orange peel extract
   (OPE) was used as an inorganic and organic nutrient source for the
   cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris OW-01. Chemical composition analysis
   of the OPE indicated that it contains sufficient nutrients for
   mixotrophic cultivation of C. vulgaris OW-01. Analysis of biomass and
   FAME production showed that microalgae grown in OPE medium produced
   3.4-times more biomass and 4.5-times more fatty acid methyl esters
   (FAMEs) than cells cultured in glucose-supplemented BG 11 medium (BG-G).
   These results suggest that growth of microalgae in an OPE-supplemented
   medium increases lipid production and that OPE has potential for use in
   the mass cultivation of microalgae.

AB An environmentally sustainable approach was developed for recovering
   lipids from Chlorella saccharophila for biodiesel production. This
   involved harvesting the microalgae via foam-aided dispersed air
   flotation (DiAF) prior to supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) extraction.
   Response surface methodology was used to investigate the extraction
   conditions that would affect the fatty acid composition within the
   lipids, measured analytically as total fatty acid methyl ester (T-FAME)
   and biodiesel dominant FAME (BD-FAME) content (% dcw). SC-CO2 extraction
   parameters for maximum T-FAME (20.41.9% dcw) and BD-FAME (9.80.4% dcw)
   content in the extracted lipids were 90 min, 241 bar, 73°C and 89%
   moisture (w/w), and 86 min, 241 bar, 73°C and 86% moisture (w/w),
   respectively. Further analysis indicated that good T-FAME and BD-FAME
   content could be achieved when the extraction time was reduced to 30 min
   without drying, which may be more industrially favorable, as they would
   reduce processing expenses. Furthermore, the exposure of biomass to
   surfactant was found to have a significant effect on the composition of
   FAME in the extracted lipids. Surfactant exposed biomass, resulted in
   T-FAME and BD-FAME contents of 5.3 and 2.4% (dcw), respectively, and a
   longer exposure time resulted in higher contents. Centrifuged biomass
   had a FAME profile most suited for biodiesel. However, surfactant
   exposure resulted in higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which
   could be recovered as high value-added byproducts, and potentially
   improve the overall process economics. These findings suggest that the
   lipid composition can be tailored to suit specific applications by
   adjusting the extraction parameters and surfactant exposure.

AB Biodiesel is a promising alternative to reduce the dependency on fossil
   fuels. However, biodiesel's cost is still higher than its petroleum
   counterpart, hence its production process must be modified to make it
   economically viable. Microalgae are an alternative feedstock to replace
   agricultural crops for biodiesel production, and offer several
   advantages such as fast growth, use of non-arable land, growth in saline
   and wastewater, and high lipid yield. Unfortunately, biodiesel
   production from microalgae is very energy-intensive and costly, mainly
   due to the high energy consumption required for dewatering and drying.
   Therefore, utilizing wet microalgal biomass instead of dry biomass can
   be a promising solution to reduce the biodiesel production cost
   Furthermore, the use of heterogeneous catalysts offers high efficiency,
   recoverability, and reusability, and is therefore very promising from
   the economic and environmental perspectives. The unique characteristics
   of graphene-based nano-catalysts, such as their high surface area,
   two-dimensional structure, and functional groups, make them suitable
   candidates for biodiesel production. In this review, the use of
   graphene-based catalysts for biodiesel production is analyzed in depth,
   and their efficiency compared to other heterogeneous catalysts is
   scrutinized. Moreover, their recoverability, reusability, and economic
   feasibility are critically discussed, and their potential to produce
   biodiesel from wet microalgae is explored as a sustainable and
   cost-effective approach.

   the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)
   agency to researchers in Brazil, who study the potential uses of
   microalgae for biomass, bioproducts and biofuels production. These
   funded projects addressed aspects of algal strain identification,
   development of algal cultivation techniques, designing photobioreactors
   and raceway ponds, modeling harvesting and dewatering process,
   maximizing biomass and oil productivities, characterizing chemical
   composition with different extractions systems and determining
   physiochemical properties of biodiesel. This review presents the state
   of art of algal research conducted by Brazilian institutions. Special
   attention is given to the recent progress on microalgal cultivation,
   high-value products extracted from microalgae and potential biofuels
   production. This review may serve as a policy instrument for planning
   next steps for algal research in Brazil as well as for attracting

AB The source and sink balance of fuel on earth, has been time and again
   challenged by the growing consumerism of fuel by people. To meet these
   demands, alternative fuel technology is currently a growing industry of
   research, especially the use of organisms like algae to harvest fuel,
   has been one of the recent developments in plant biotechnology. Algae
   being photosynthetic in nature, utilizes the sugar they produce, to
   harvest fuel in a scientifically driven manner. However there is a
   limitation to the variety of oil produced from the same algae decreasing
   the yield efficiency. But thanks to science, we have come up with new
   skills to harvest different types of oil products from the same algae
   using different sugar inputs in a dark acclimatized metabolic pathway. A
   few algae like Chlorella protothecoids and Botryococcus braunii are fed
   with rich carbohydrate sources (grass and woodchips) in dark, where it
   gets converted into oil using underlying principles of fermentation. The
   heterotrophic growth mode of algae favors an oil yield 3.4 times higher
   than autotrophic one, with a cetane rate of the fuel obtained as 74,
   which is ideal for any fuel. The Oil can further be upgraded using

AB Cyanobacteria have been identified as promising organisms to reuse
   nutrients from waste effluents and produce valuable compounds such as
   lipids, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), and pigments. However, almost all
   studies on cyanobacterial biorefineries have been performed under lab
   scale and short cultivation periods. The present study evaluates the
   cultivation of the cyanobacteriumSynechocystissp. in a pilot scale 30 L
   semi-continuous photobioreactor fed with secondary effluent for a period
   of 120 days to produce phycobiliproteins, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and
   lipids. To this end, the harvested biomass from the semi-continuous
   photobioreactor was transferred into 5 L vertical column batch
   photobioreactors to perform PHB and lipid accumulation under nutrient
   starvation. Three hydraulic retention times (HRT) (6, 8 and 10 days)
   were tested in the semi-continuous photobioreactor to evaluate its
   influence on biomass growth and microbial community. A maximum biomass
   concentration of 1.413 g L-1and maximum productivity of 173 mg L-1d-1was
   reached under HRT of 8 days. Microscopy analysis revealed a shift
   fromSynechocystissp. toLeptolyngbyasp. and green algae when HRT of 6
   days was used. Continuous, stable production of phycobiliproteins in the
   semi-continuous photobioreactor was obtained, reaching a maximum content
   of 7.4%dcwin the biomass. In the batch photobioreactors a PHB content of
   4.8%dcwwas reached under 7 days of nitrogen and phosphorus starvation,
   while a lipids content of 44.7%dcwwas achieved under 30 days of nitrogen
   starvation. PHB and lipids production was strongly dependent on the
   amount of nutrients withdrawn from the grow phase. In the case of
   lipids, their production was stimulated when there was only phosphorus
   depletion. While Nitrogen and phosphorus limitation was needed to
   enhance the PHB production. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the
   feasibility of cultivating cyanobacteria in treated wastewater to
   produce bio-based valuable compounds within a circular bioeconomy
   approach.

AB Improvements in lipid productivity would enhance the economic
   feasibility of microalgal biodiesel. In order to optimise lipid
   productivity, both the growth rate and lipid content of algal cells must
   be maximised. The lipid content of many microalgae can be enhanced
   through nitrogen limitation, but at the expense of biomass productivity.
   This suggests that a two-stage nitrogen supply strategy might improve
   lipid productivity. Two different nitrogen supply strategies were
   investigated for their effect on lipid productivity in Chlorella
   vulgaris. The first was an initial nitrogen-replete stage, designed to
   optimise biomass productivity, followed by nitrogen limitation to
   enhance lipid content (two-stage batch) and the second was an initial
   nitrogen-limited stage, designed to maximise lipid content, followed by
   addition of nitrogen to enhance biomass concentration (fed-batch).
   Volumetric lipid yield in nitrogen-limited two-stage batch and fed-batch
   was compared with that achieved in nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limited
   batch culture. In a previous work, maximum lipid productivity in batch
   culture was found at an intermediate level of nitrogen limitation
   (starting nitrate concentration of 170 mg L-1). Overall lipid
   productivity was not improved by using fed-batch or two-stage culture
   strategies, although these strategies showed higher volumetric lipid
   concentrations than nitrogen-replete batch culture. The dilution of
   cultures prior to nitrogen deprivation led to increased lipid
   accumulation, indicating that the availability of light influenced the
   rate of lipid accumulation. However, dilution did not lead to increased
   lipid productivity due to the resulting lower biomass concentration.

AB The potential of algal biomass as a source of liquid and gaseous
   biofuels is a highly topical theme, but as yet there is no successful
   economically viable commercial system producing biofuel. However, the
   majority of the research has focused on producing fuels from microalgae
   rather than from macroalgae. This article briefly reviews the methods by
   which useful energy may be extracted from macroalgae biomass including:
   direct combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, trans-esterification to
   biodiesel, hydrothermal liquefaction, fermentation to bioethanol,
   fermentation to biobutanol and anaerobic digestion, and explores
   technical and engineering difficulties that remain to be resolved.

AB Microalgae consortia were photoautotrophically cultivated in sequencing
   batch photobioreactors (SBPRs) with an alteration of the normal growth
   and starvation (nutrient limitation) phases to select consortia capable
   of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) accumulation. At the steady state of SBPR
   operation, the obtained microalgae consortia, selected under nitrogen
   and phosphate limitation, accumulated up to 11.38% and 10.24% of PHA in
   their biomass, which was identified as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB).
   Photoautotrophic and mixotrophic batch cultivation of the selected
   microalgae consortia was conducted to investigate the potential of
   biomass and PHA production. Sugar source supplementation enhanced the
   biomass and PHA production, with the highest PHA contents of 10.94 and
   6.2%, and cumulative PHA productions of 100 and 130 mg/L, with this
   being achieved with sugarcane juice under nitrogen and phosphate
   limitation, respectively. The analysis of other macromolecules during
   batch cultivation indicated a high content of carbohydrates and lipids
   under nitrogen limitation, while higher protein contents were detected
   under phosphate limitation. These results recommended the selected
   microalgae consortia as potential tools for PHA and bioresource
   production. The mixed-culture non-sterile cultivation system developed
   in this study provides valuable information for large-scale microalgal
   PHA production process development following the biorefinery concept.

AB The world's rising energy needs, and the depletion of fossil resources
   demand a shift from fossil-based feedstocks to organic waste to develop
   a competitive, resource-efficient, and low-carbon sustainable economy in
   the long run. It is well known that the production of fuels and
   chemicals via chemical routes is advantageous because it is a
   well-established technology with low production costs. However, the use
   of toxic/environmentally harmful and expensive catalysts generates toxic
   intermediates, making the process unsustainable. Alternatively,
   utilization of renewable resources for bioprocessing with a
   multi-product approach that aligns novel integration improves resource
   utilization and contributes to the "green economy". The present review
   discusses organic waste bioprocessing through the anaerobic fermentation
   (AF) process to produce biohydrogen (H2), biomethane (CH4), volatile
   fatty acids (VFAs) and medium chain fatty acids (MCFA). Furthermore, the
   roles of photosynthetic bacteria and microalgae for biofuel production
   are discussed. In addition, a roadmap to create a fermentative
   biorefinery approach in the framework of an AF-integrated bioprocessing
   format is deliberated, along with limitations and future scope. This
   novel bioprocessing approach significantly contributes to promoting the
   circular bioeconomy by launching complete carbon turnover practices in
   accordance with sustainable development goals.

AB Cost-efficient harvesting of microalgae is a major challenge for
   large-scale biomass production. The present study aimed to optimize and
   model the flocculation process for efficient harvest of the biodiesel
   promising green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus grown in municipal
   wastewater. In addition, the influence of applied flocculation on
   biodiesel recovery was measured. Ferric sulphate showed the highest
   relative flocculation efficiency in comparison with the other tested
   flocculants. At initial OD680 of 1, the flocculent dose required to
   achieve 99.5% flocculation efficiency was 150 mg L-1 after 40 min. In
   addition, relatively higher flocculation efficiencies of S. obliquus
   cells were observed at lower initial OD680. The suggested polynomial
   model showed satisfactory and accurate results, with high positive
   correlation (0.956) between the calculated and measured flocculation
   efficiency. Furthermore, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) yield of the
   flocculated biomass showed 40.9% significant increase (P <0.01) over the
   centrifuged cells. It can be concluded that flocculation using ferric
   sulphate is greatly advantageous, as in a single step it served a dual
   propose of algal biomass harvest and enhanced FAMEs recovery at doses
   much lower than that used in wastewater treatment plants.

AB The microalgaChlorella vulgarisis a potential feedstock for bioenergy
   due to its rapid growth, carbon dioxide fixation efficiency, and high
   accumulation of lipids and carbohydrates. In particular, the
   carbohydrates in microalgae make them a candidate for bioethanol
   feedstock. In this study, nutrient stress cultivation was employed to
   enhance the carbohydrate content ofC. vulgaris. Nitrogen limitation
   increased the carbohydrate content to 22.4% from the normal content of
   16.0% on dry weight basis. In addition, several pretreatment methods and
   enzymes were investigated to increase saccharification yields.
   Bead-beating pretreatment increased hydrolysis by 25% compared with the
   processes lacking pretreatment. In the enzymatic hydrolysis process, the
   pectinase enzyme group was superior for releasing fermentable sugars
   from carbohydrates in microalgae. In particular, pectinase
   fromAspergillus aculeatusdisplayed a 79% saccharification yield after 72
   h at 50°C. Using continuous immobilized yeast fermentation, microalgal
   hydrolysate was converted into ethanol at a yield of 89%.

AB Renewable energy from lipid removed microalgal residues (LRARs) serves
   as a promising tool for sustainable development of the microalgal
   biodiesel industry. Hence, in this study, LRAR from Ettlia sp. was
   characterized for its physico-biochemical parameters, and applied to
   various pretreatment to increase the biodegradability and used in batch
   experiments for the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and
   biomethane. After various pretreatments, the soluble organic matters
   were increased at a maximum of 82% in total organic matters in
   alkali-autoclaved sample. In addition, VFA and methane production was
   enhanced by 30% and 40% in alkali-sonicated and alkali-autoclaved
   samples, respectively. Methane heating value was recovered at maximum of
   6.6 MJ kg-1 VS in alkali-autoclaved conditions with comparison to
   non-pretreated samples. The pretreatment remarkably improved LRAR
   solubilization and enhanced VFA and biomethane production, which holds
   immense potential to eventually reduce the cost of algal biodiesel.

   present study, Fremyella diplosiphon wild-type (Fd33) and halotolerant
   (HSF33-2) strains were grown in solution with 20-, 100-, and
   200-nm-diameter gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to determine their impact on
   biomass accumulation, pigmentation, and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)
   production. Results revealed a significant increase in growth of Fd33
   (0.2440.006) and HSF33-2 (0.1120.003) when treated with 200-nm AuNPs. In
   addition, we observed a significant increase in chlorophyll a
   accumulation in 200-nm AuNP-treated Fd33 (25.7%) and HSF33-2 (36.3%)
   indicating that NPs enhanced photosynthetic pigmentation. We did not
   observe any alteration in FAME composition and biodiesel properties of
   transesterified F. diplosiphon lipids among all AuNP treatments.
   Interactions between F. diplosiphon and AuNPs were visualized using
   scanning electron microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   confirmed the presence of AuNPs outside the cells with aggregation in
   high cell density locales. Our findings indicate that nanotechnological
   approaches could significantly enhance growth of the organism with no
   negative effect on FAME-derived biodiesel properties, thus augmenting F.
   diplosiphon potential as a biofuel agent.

AB Background: Biodiesel or ethanol derived from lipids or starch produced
   by microalgae may overcome many of the sustainability challenges
   previously ascribed to petroleum-based fuels and first generation
   plant-based biofuels. The paucity of microalgae genome sequences,
   however, limits gene-based biofuel feedstock optimization studies. Here
   we describe the sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly for the
   non-model microalgae species, Dunaliella tertiolecta, and identify
   pathways and genes of importance related to biofuel production. Results:
   Next generation DNA pyrosequencing technology applied to D. tertiolecta
   transcripts produced 1,363,336 high quality reads with an average length
   of 400 bases. Following quality and size trimming, 45% of the high
   quality reads were assembled into 33,307 isotigs with a 31-fold coverage
   and 376,482 singletons. Assembled sequences and singletons were
   subjected to BLAST similarity searches and annotated with Gene Ontology
   (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology (KO)
   identifiers. These analyses identified the majority of lipid and starch
   biosynthesis and catabolism pathways in D. tertiolecta. Conclusions: The
   construction of metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and
   catabolism of fatty acids, triacylglycrols, and starch in D. tertiolecta
   as well as the assembled transcriptome provide a foundation for the
   molecular genetics and functional genomics required to direct metabolic
   engineering efforts that seek to enhance the quantity and character of
   microalgae-based biofuel feedstock.

AB Increasing energy demands lead to the search for sustainable biofuels
   such as biodiesel from renewable sources such as algal biomass.
   Specially, microalgae have become increasingly popular as biodiesel
   feedstock due to their fast-growing rates and relatively high level of
   lipids. The non-catalytic transesterification reaction of microalgae oil
   under supercritical conditions in the presence of alcohols is an
   efficient process for biodiesel production and can overcome some of the
   limitations posed by subcritical catalytic transesterification. Two-step
   and one-step processes have been reported for this purpose, in the last
   case with extraction and transesterification stages being performed
   simultaneously. This works offer a systematic review using the PRISMA
   methodology analyzing the status of this research topic and identifying
   future research strategies. With this work, PRISMA methodology is
   applied for the first time within technological engineering fields.
   Moreover, this is the first specific overview on the production of
   biodiesel from microalgae under supercritical conditions. Several key
   factors such as microalgae type and operation variables including
   extraction oil, temperature and reaction time, pressure, water content
   in biomass, alcohol excess and final biodiesel properties are discussed.
   Further efforts need to be done in order to study the continuous
   biodiesel production by the development of integrated processes that
   involve both microalgae cultivation and biodiesel production.

AB Biofuels/Bioenergy is renewable in nature by mitigating the greenhouse
   gas emissions despite rapid economic growth and energy demand. Biodiesel
   and bioethanol production from renewable sources are gaining much
   attention but unable to translate the technologies into commercially
   ventures. Several technical challenges like the screening of algae/yeast
   for higher lipid accumulation/ethanol production, separation and
   purification of microalgae from contaminants, harvesting of microalgae,
   improving transesterification efficiency with meager solvent
   consumption, energy and time have been addressed using microfluidic
   devices. Besides, it has shown promising results in microbial fuel cell
   domain. Microfluidics and microreactors offer miniaturization of
   experiments by a very little expense of solvents, energy and time with
   higher precision results. Moreover, it provides 19.2% higher surface to
   volume ratio when compared with Petri dish (35 mm diameter) and
   microchannel (50 m tall, 50 m wide, and 30 mm long). Higher surface to
   volume ratio is helpful in the integration of the whole laboratory
   (i.e., lab-on-a-chip), where efficient screening of ethanol/lipid
   producer, higher transesterification efficiency could be ascertained.
   Due to the overwhelming potential of microfluidics in biofuel and
   bioenergy sectors, the present review article illustrated several
   examples to depict the importance of microfluidics towards
   high-throughput analysis of screening the potent microbial/microalgal
   strain, fabrication of microfluidic bioreactor, quality analysis of
   biofuel and bioenergy products.

AB Carbon dioxide supplementation regulates the metabolism of
   photosynthetic organisms, initiating CO2fixation through the central
   carbon metabolism and partitioning the carbon in various metabolic
   processes. It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of
   carbon fixation and partitioning to control and regulate biomass and
   lipid production. In this context, we investigated the metabolic and
   physiological responses of a freshwater microalga,Chlorella
   saccharophila, supplemented with very low CO2(VLC) (300 ppm or 0.03%)
   and high CO2(HC) (30 000 ppm, or 3% v/v), for its potential as a
   biorefinery strain. Our results demonstrate that growth with HC was
   enhanced 1.4-fold in comparison with VLC. We speculate that growth with
   VLC was supported by the central electron flow. Similar changes were
   observed in various biochemical constituents, i.e., lipids, proteins and
   carbohydrates. It was also observed that the total pigment productivity
   was 1.8-fold higher with HC supplementation than in cultures
   supplemented with VLC, further indicating enhanced growth in HC.
   Applying qualitative metabolomics, we identified nearly 23 essential
   metabolites. There was an accumulation of sugars and antioxidants such
   as trehalose and alpha-tocopherol in VLC as compared to HC. In
   conclusion, our objective is to understand HC supplementation inC.

   enhanced biomass for the production of biofuels and high-value

AB This review describes different potential sources for amino acids that
   could be used for the production of bulk chemicals in a biorefinery,
   such as agricultural byproduct streams. Volumes at which these sources
   and the amino acids therein are available were determined, and the most
   interesting amino acids in terms of their potential available quantity
   were identified. The investigated sources are maize and wheat DDGS,
   sugarcane vinasse and its leaves, sugar beet vinasse and its leaves,
   cassava leaves, press cakes of rapeseed, sunflower, soybean, palm oil
   andJatropha, animal slaughter waste, microalgae, macroalgae, grass and
   alfalfa. It can be concluded that there are enough sources available to
   produce bio-based chemicals such as N-methylpyrrolidone with a market
   sizes around 100 kt per year from amino acids. Bulk chemicals such as
   acrylonitrile can partly be replaced in the future by their bio-based
   equivalent, depending on the amounts of biofuels that will be produced
   in the future. However, it is still necessary to find cost-effective
   methods for the isolation of amino acids from the discussed sources.

AB Microalgal lipids have been considered as one of the most promising
   feedstocks for biodiesel production. In order to solve the contradiction
   of algae growth and lipid accumulation,Chlorella vulgariswas co-cultured
   withMesorhizobium sangaiiunder nitrogen deficiency conditions. The
   biomass and lipid production ofC. vulgaris-bacteria co-culture with
   initial ratio of algae/bacteria = 40:1 were significantly improved
   compared with the pure algae culture. The maximum biomass, lipid content
   and productivity of algae in the co-cultures at 40:1 ratio were 1.89 mg
   L-1, 51.2%, and 96.77 mg L-1day-1, respectively, which were 1.5, 2.2,
   and 3.3 times higher than those of the pure algae culture. Furthermore,
   the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and C18:1 fatty acid of the
   consortium system was also significantly increased. Our study clearly
   suggests that co-cultivation of algae-bacteria can effectively
   contribute to the quality and quantity of microalgal bio-oil and shows
   promising applications for production of algal biomass and biodiesel.

AB A two-step sequential hydrothermal liquefaction (SEQHTL) model for
   simultaneous extraction of polysaccharide at the first step followed by
   bio-oil in the second was established. The effects of reaction
   temperature, residence time, and biomass/water ratio on the product
   distribution of each SEQHTL step were evaluated. Maximum yield (32 wt.%)
   of polysaccharides was obtained at 160°C, 20 min and 1:9 biomass/water
   ratio. Considering the operation cost and bio-oil yield (>30%); 240°C,
   20 min and 1:9 biomass/water ratio was preferred as ideal SEQHTL
   condition for bio-oil extraction. SEQHTL always produced 5% more bio-oil
   and 50% less bio-char than direct hydrothermal liquefaction (DHTL). Free
   fatty acid content of the bio-oils exhibited a sharp decrease with
   increase in temperature. Comparative analysis of the energy input and
   net energy balance showed that SEQHTL requires 15% less MJ/kg bio-oil
   than DHTL. Energy recovery rate for SEQHTL is nearly 4% higher than the
   DHTL.

AB Over the past few years microalgae have emerged as the most promising
   feedstock for biodiesel production. However, enhancing lipid content
   remains a major scientific challenge. Many studies irrationally rely
   upon nitrogen starvation for improving lipid content at the cost of
   biomass. In this study, strategic enhancement of neutral lipid without
   compromising with biomass production was achieved in marine Chlorella
   variabilis by supplementing the culture with triacylglycerol pathway
   intermediate, citric acid (1 g L-1 pure and 0.5 g L-1 orange peel
   extract as a low cost substitute). The microalga accumulated 17% and 34%
   (on dry cell weight basis) more neutral lipid, when cultivated in with
   citric acid and orange peel extract as supplements respectively, without
   any adverse effect on growth. The medium supplemented with orange peel
   extract stimulated better growth than that supplemented with citric
   acid. Gas chromatography studies validated that both the supplemented
   media yielded desired fatty acid composition for biodiesel production.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is considered as one of the most
   promising methods for converting algal biomass to bio-oil and other
   value-added chemicals. The conventional HTL process, however, is limited
   by its incapability of recovering high-value bioactive compounds that
   are desirable for enhancing overall process feasibility. The two-stage
   sequential hydrothermal liquefaction (SEQHTL) process was proposed as an
   alternative to overcome this limitation. SEQHTL operates at reduced
   temperature and pressure to facilitate production of co-products in
   addition to bio-oil. This article offers a comprehensive review of the
   SEQHTL process in comparison with conventional HTL. Main topics include:
   operation principles and targeting final products of HTL, reaction
   mechanisms of algal biomass in the HTL process, recent publications on
   algae-related HTL studies, features of the SEQHTL process, advantages of
   the SEQHTL process for production of high quality bio-oil as well as
   extraction of prospective high-value co-products that may be harvested
   from microalgae biomass, cost advantage of the SEQHTL process,
   challenges identified with techno-economic and life-cycle assessments,
   and suggested future HTL research and development in comparison with
   other conversion technologies. All these aspects collectively provide an
   overview of the SEQHTL technology.

AB Microalgal biomass is a promising feedstock for biofuels, feed/food, and
   biomaterials. However, while production and commercialization of
   single-product commodities are still not economically viable, obtaining
   multiple products in a biomass biorefinery faces several techno-economic
   challenges. The aim of this study was to identify a suitable source of
   hydrolytic enzymes for algal biomass saccharification. Screening of
   twenty-six fungal isolates for secreted enzymes activity onChlamydomonas
   reinhardtiibiomass resulted in the identification ofAspergillus
   nigerIB-34 as a candidate strain. Solid-state fermentation on wheat bran
   produced the most active enzyme preparations. From sixty-five proteins
   identified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
   (ProteomeXchange, identifier PXD034998) fromA. nigerIB-34, the majority
   corresponded to predicted secreted proteins belonging to the Gene

   strains towards the production of commodities,Chlorella
   sorokinianaandScenedesmus obliquus, was fully saccharified after a mild
   pretreatment at 80°C for 10 min, at a high biomass load of 10% (w/v).
   The soluble liquid stream, after skimming and saccharification of
   biomass of both strains, was further converted into ethanol by
   fermentation withSaccharomyces cerevisiaeat a theoretical maximum
   efficiency, in a separated saccharification and fermentation assays. The
   resulting insoluble protein, after biomass skimming with an organic
   solvent and enzymatic saccharification, was highly digestible in an in

   enzyme-assisted biomass biorefinery recovering 81% of the main biomass
   fractions in a likely suitable form for the conversion of lipids and
   carbohydrates into biofuels and proteins into feed/food.

AB Bio-oil from microalgae has attracted attention for its extraordinary
   raw material utilization advantages and environmentally friendly
   characteristics. In order to increase the renewable energy utilization
   efficiency of microalgae biomass, research on the production line of
   microalgae cultivation and pyrolysis is essential. In this study, three
   high lipid content microalgae strains, including Micractinium reisseri,
   Scenedesmus obliquus SAG276-10 and Scenedesmus obliquus FACHB-276, have
   been selected to examine their capacity for crude bio-oil production
   under different pyrolysis conditions. The calculation of economic
   feasibility showed that M. reisseri comprised the most efficient energy
   conversion among considered strains. Gas Chromatography-Mass
   Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed a significant difference in the
   composition of crude bio-oil produced by non-catalytic and catalytic
   pyrolysis. The application of HZSM-5 increased the hydrocarbon content
   of the M. reisseri and S. obliquus FACHB-276 and decreased the ether and
   ester content of S. obliquus SAG276-10 upon pyrolysis when compared with
   non-catalytic pyrolysis. Although the use of MCM-41 was detrimental to
   the formation of hydrocarbons and increased the content of
   nitrogen-containing compounds, the mixture of HZSM-5 and MCM-41 greatly
   elevated the hydrocarbon content of S. obliquus SAG276-10 and S.
   obliquus FACHB-276.

U1 7
U2 92
AB Phytoplankton have great potential for biodiesel production and offer
   promises and opportunities in the long term. Phytoplankton species reach
   higher growth rates, and thus productivity, than conventional forestry
   or agricultural crops and other aquatic plants. The oil yield in
   phytoplankton is an order of magnitude larger than terrestrial
   oleaginous crops. To meet the potential of phytoplankton-based biodiesel
   there is a need to radically increase lipid yields, which are generally
   produced under adverse conditions. Nutrients stress and alterations of
   cultivation conditions are commonly used as lipid enhancement
   strategies. It is difficult to get a clear picture of the most
   efficicent factors affecting lipid accumulation and productivity from
   the abundant literature on this topic, dispatched into a large variety
   of species and stresses. This article seeks to summarize the widely
   reported information on TAGs accumulation in phytoplankton and to
   decipher the regulation mechanisms triggered along the diversity of
   enhancement strategies. Most of the factors affecting lipid content and
   composition were analyzed, such as nutrient starvation, temperature,
   irradiance, salinity, oxidative stress, metals, CO2 flux, pH and
   metabolic engineering. In this review, we compiled 213 experiments with
   lipid analysis, dealing with 95 marine and freshwater phytoplankton
   (microalgae and cyanobacteria) species. Quantitative indicators (lipid
   content and productivity), stress level and exposure time, are
   presented. This review highlights the complexity of comparison between
   phyla due to differences in culture conditions, analytical methods
   and/or growth phase. It provides valuable tools for triggering
   phytoplanktonic lipid biosynthesis and opens the door for enhanced
   quality and quantity of phytoplankton-based biodiesel.

AB Keeping in view, the challenges concerning agro-ecosystem and
   environment, the recent developments in biotechnology offers a more
   reliable approach to address the food security for future generations
   and also resolve the complex environmental problems. Several unique
   features of cyanobacteria such as oxygenic photosynthesis, high biomass
   yield, growth on non-arable lands and a wide variety of water sources
   (contaminated and polluted waters), generation of useful by-products and
   bio-fuels, enhancing the soil fertility and reducing green house gas
   emissions, have collectively offered these bio-agents as the precious
   bio-resource for sustainable development. Cyanobacterial biomass is the
   effective bio-fertilizer source to improve soil physico-chemical
   characteristics such as water-holding capacity and mineral nutrient
   status of the degraded lands. The unique characteristics of
   cyanobacteria include their ubiquity presence, short generation time and
   capability to fix the atmospheric N2. Similar to other prokaryotic
   bacteria, the cyanobacteria are increasingly applied as bio-inoculants
   for improving soil fertility and environmental quality. Genetically
   engineered cyanobacteria have been devised with the novel genes for the
   production of a number of bio-fuels such as bio-diesel, bio-hydrogen,
   bio-methane, synga, and therefore, open new avenues for the generation
   of bio-fuels in the economically sustainable manner. This review is an
   effort to enlist the valuable information about the qualities of
   cyanobacteria and their potential role in solving the agricultural and
   environmental problems for the future welfare of the planet.

AB This study provides a life cycle assessment of the energy balance and
   the potential greenhouse gas impacts of heterotrophic microalgal-derived
   biodiesel estimated from the upstream biomass production to the
   downstream emissions from biodiesel combustion. Heterotrophic microalgae
   can be cultivated using a by-product from biodiesel production such as
   glycerol as a carbon source. The oils within the algal biomass can then
   be converted to biodiesel using transesterification or hydroprocessing
   techniques. This approach may provide a solution to the limited
   availability of biomass feedstock for production of biorefined
   transportation fuels. The life cycle assessment of a virtual production
   facility, modeled on experimental yield data, has demonstrated that
   cultivation of heterotrophic microalgae for the production of biodiesel
   is comparable, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage (90
   g CO2e MJ-1), to fossil diesel (85 g CO2e MJ-1). The life cycle
   assessment identified that improvement in cultivation conditions, in
   particular the bioreactor energy inputs and microalgae yield, will be
   critical in developing a sustainable production system. Our research
   shows the potential of heterotrophic microalgae to provide Australia's
   transportation fleet with a secure, environmentally sustainable
   alternative fuel.

AB Integration of anaerobic digestion (AD) with microalgae processes has
   become a key topic to support economic and environmental development of
   this resource. Compared with other substrates, microalgae can be
   produced close to the plant without the need for arable lands and be
   fully integrated within a biorefinery. As a limiting step, anaerobic
   hydrolysis appears to be one of the most challenging steps to reach a
   positive economic balance and to completely exploit the potential of
   microalgae for biogas and fertilizers production. This review covers
   recent investigations dealing with microalgae AD and highlights research
   opportunities and needs to support the development of this resource.
   Novel approaches to increase hydrolysis rate, the importance of the
   reactor design and the noteworthiness of the microbial anaerobic
   community are addressed. Finally, the integration of AD with microalgae
   processes and the potential of the carboxylate platform for chemicals
   and biofuels production are reviewed.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste (FW) has become of great interest
   in recent years due to the high organic removal rates and positive net
   energy balance. However, two key issues should be highlighted. On the
   one hand, AD effluent still needs to be purified in order to meet
   ecologically acceptable requirements for direct disposal. On the other
   hand, AD plants have been mainly based on mesophilic and thermophilic
   temperatures, which may represent an important economic barrier for
   extending AD to small- and medium-sized plants. Hence, the aim of this
   paper is to assess the AD of FW at low temperature and the
   post-treatment of anaerobic digestate by using microalgae cultivation at
   laboratory scale. This study explores an economical alternative for
   small- and medium-size treatment plants loaded with FW. Inoculum and FW
   were physical and chemically characterized, and 5-L glass batch reactors
   in triplicate were used for determining the biochemical methane
   potential. The chemical oxygen demand (COD), biogas production and its
   composition were measured until the end of batch tests. The
   post-digestate was assessed as cultivation media for the
   microalgaeScenedesmussp. by varying the dilution rate with fresh water.
   After 15 days, microalgae was harvested and the liquid fraction was
   assessed in accordance with the Chilean legal requirements. Although AD
   of FW at psychrophilic temperature leads to a lower biogas yield, the
   COD was reduced up to 97.5%, microalgae was successfully cultivated in
   all post-digestate dilutions, and some of them allowed the use of
   effluent for irrigation.

   (TAGs)], feasible substrates for biofuel, are typically accumulated
   during the stationary growth phase. To make microalgal biofuels
   economically competitive with fossil fuels, generating strains that
   trigger TAG accumulation from the exponential growth phase is a
   promising biological approach. The regulatory mechanisms to trigger TAG
   accumulation from the exponential growth phase (TAEP) are important to
   be uncovered for advancing economic feasibility. Through the inhibition
   of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase by sodium dichloroacetate, acetyl-CoA
   level increased, resulting in TAEP in microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta.
   We further reported refilling of acetyl-CoA pool through branched-chain
   amino acid catabolism contributed to an overall sixfold TAEP with
   marginal compromise (4%) on growth in a TAG-rich D. tertiolecta mutant
   from targeted screening. Herein, a three-step alpha loop-integrated
   metabolic model is introduced to shed lights on the neutral lipid
   regulatory mechanism. This article provides novel approaches to compress
   lipid production phase and heightens lipid productivity and
   photosynthetic carbon capture via enhancing acetyl-CoA level, which
   would optimize renewable microalgal biofuel to fulfil the demanding fuel
   market.

AB Conventional microalgal cultivation method relied on suspended growth or
   attached growth that uses inert solid surfaces, requiring the addition
   of external carbon sources to promote microalgal growth. The inert solid
   substrates for attached microalgae pose constraints on the maximal
   capabilities of these microorganisms as it does not possess the ability
   to provide the necessary nutritional support required for optimal
   microalgal growth. As a result, microalgae are obliged to only rely on
   the solid substrate as a means of attachment, without any further
   nutritional provisions. Slower growth rates, larger resource
   requirements, and exorbitant operating expenses had prompted the
   exploration of an alternative strategy, i.e; the innovative use of solid
   organic waste as nutritional source cum attachment platform. The
   findings of this review unveil key insights into microalgae cultivation
   system, offering a solution to economic challenges in the production
   phase. This innovation not only promotes economic feasibility and
   sustainability, but also contributes to economically viable and
   environmentally sustainable biofuel production.

AB Adverse detrimental impacts of environmental pollution over the health
   regimen of people has driven a shift in lifestyle towards cleaner and
   natural resources, especially in the aspects of food production and
   consumption. Microalgae are considered a rich source of high value
   metabolites to be utilized as plant growth biostimulants. These
   organisms however, are underrated compared to other microbial
   counterparts, due to inappropriate knowledge on the technical,
   enviro-economical constrains leading to low market credibility. Thus, to
   avert these issues, the present review comprehensively discusses the
   biostimulatory potential of microalgae interactively combined with
   circular bio-economy perspectives. The biochemical content and
   intracellular action mechanism of microalgal biostimulants were
   described. Furthermore, detailed country-wise market trends along with
   the description of the existing regulatory policies are included.
   Enviro-techno-economic challenges are discussed, and the consensus need
   for shift to biorefinery and circular bio-economy concept are emphasized
   to achieve sustainable impacts during the commercialization of
   microalgal biostimulants.

AB Chlorella is a potential sustainable resource for biodiesel due to its
   outstanding ability of accumulating lipids under different nutrient
   limitations. However, one of the major technological bottlenecks for its
   industrialization is biomass and lipid production by the algae. In this
   study, the heterotrophic culture and metabolic flux analysis were
   performed for Chlorella lipid accumulation. The cell density of
   Chlorella sorokiniana reached the maximum in heterotrophic culture after
   12 days. The lipid content of the Chlorella increased with high glucose
   and low NaNO3 concentration. The highest lipid content of the Chlorella
   was 320 mg g-1 dry cell weight under 35 g L-1 glucose, 0.125 g L-1
   NaNO3, and 12 days of culture. A metabolic network of 34 reactions
   including Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMP), hexose monophosphate
   pathway (HMP), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and fatty acid
   biosynthesis was constructed. The fluxes of EMP, HMP, and TCA increased
   with the decrease of NaNO3 concentration. Comparison of fluxes among
   different culture stages suggested that the flux of fatty acid
   biosynthesis at the final stage was higher than that at the initial
   stage. As a result, the lipid content and lipid productivity reached
   389.46 mg g-1 dry cell weight and 0.6713 mg mL-1 under the optimal
   combination of NaNO3, glucose concentration, and harvesting time at day
   12 of culture. This study depicted a constructive network of Chlorella
   lipid biosynthesis and elucidates the mechanism of lipid biosynthesis
   under NaNO3 limitation. Furthermore, our results showed that the
   Chlorella lipid has a favorable fatty acid composition for biodiesel.

AB Microalgae are a source material in food, pharmacy, and cosmetics
   industries for producing various products including high-protein
   nutritional supplements, synthetic pharmaceuticals, and natural colors.
   A promising algal source for such productions isChlorella vulgariswhich
   contains a considerable protein content. Similar to other microalgae,
   its desirability is minimal nutrient requirements since they are
   unicellular, photosynthetic, and fast-growing microorganisms. Another
   propitious option to be produced byC. vulgarisis biodiesel, since it is
   rich in oil too. Besides, algal well thriving in presence of increased
   amount of carbon dioxide makes them a practicable alternative biofuel
   resource without some problems of the traditional ones. At the same
   time,C. vulgarisis also a promising source for nutraceuticals such as
   amino acids, vitamins, and antioxidants. This review aims to discuss the
   conditions need to be observed for achieving a favorable growth
   efficiency of theC. vulgaris, as well as targeted productions such as
   biomass, antioxidant, and biofuel. Additionally, different approaches to
   induce any specific production are also considered comprehensively.

AB Fats and oils continue to be the main feedstock for alternative
   transport fuels, especially for FAME (biodiesel) production.
   Nevertheless, hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO), which are mixtures of
   alkanes, are also established as a commercial fuel. This review
   describes recent developments in FAME and HVO production and
   utilization, including microbial oil use. However, the use of unmodified
   plant oil as fuel or their corresponding engine and emission tests are
   not discussed. Recent developed catalysts are described for FAME
   production, including heterogeneous catalysts, such as super acids,
   ion-exchange resins, and other green catalysts produced from biomass.
   Bio-catalytic approaches using soluble or immobilized enzymes are at the
   early commercialization stage. Since HVO production technology is based
   mainly on current mineral oil industry processing methods, the
   scientific literature is not as extensive as that of FAME production.
   The main reaction routes of HVO are a combination of hydrogenation,
   decarboxylation, decarbonylation, hydroisomerization, and cracking under
   high pressure and temperatures, using supported and unsupported
   heterogeneous metal catalysts. Recent reports have highlighted the
   potential use of non-food oils, such as microalgae lipids, but
   industrial significant progress has not occurred, leading to some
   disillusionment with this approach. Therefore, a clear strategy should
   be developed for upstream and downstream processes with parallel
   evaluation of life cycle assessment (LCA). In addition, energy intensive
   steps of biomass drying and solvent extraction should be avoided by
   using intelligent technologies, such as in situ processing of wet
   biomass.

AB The separation of multiple products from microalgae using a biorefinery
   approach is essential for the economic sustainability of
   microalgae-based products. In the current study, a technique for the
   simultaneous extraction of such products was investigated for the
   complete valorization of microalgae biomass. Three principal metabolites
   - chlorophylls, carbohydrates and proteins - were simultaneously
   fractionated from the biomass of isolatedChlorella thermophilausing a
   modified version of the triphasic separation (TPS) process. Optimized
   process parameters were determined as: (i) ammonium sulfate as the salt;
   (ii) 40% (w/v) as the salt concentration; (iii) 1:1 as the salt/alcohol
   ratio; (iv) 0.25% (w/w) as biomass loading; (v) 6 min of homogenization
   time, and (vi) 10 000 rpm as homogenization speed. These optimized
   process parameters resulted in the simultaneous recovery of 71%, 40%,
   and 22% yields for proteins, carbohydrates, and chlorophylls,
   respectively. Ultrastructure analysis revealed that intracellular
   metabolites could be extracted without complete cell disruption.
   Finally, a comparative analysis between triphasic separation with and
   without homogenization demonstrated the economic feasibility of the
   optimized extraction process.

AB Microalgae are recognized as a potential source of biomass for obtaining
   bioenergy. However, the lack of studies towards economic viability and
   environmental sustainability of the entire production chain limits its
   large-scale application. The use of wastewaters economizes natural
   resources used for algal biomass cultivation. However, desirable biomass
   characteristics for a good fuel may be impaired when wastewaters are
   used, namely low lipid content and high ash and protein contents. Thus,
   the choice of wastewaters with more favorable characteristics may be one
   way of obtaining a more balanced macromolecular composition of the algal
   biomass and therefore, a more suitable feedstock for the desired
   energetic route. The exploration of biorefinery concept and the use of
   wastewaters as culture medium are considered as the main strategic tools
   in the search of this viability. Considering the economics of overall
   process, direct utilization of wet biomass using hydrothermal
   liquefaction or hydrothermal carbonization and anaerobic digestion is
   recommended. Among the explored routes, anaerobic digestion is the most
   studied process. However, some main challenges remain as little
   explored, such as a low energy pretreatment and suitable and large-scale
   reactors for algal biomass digestion. On the other hand, thermochemical
   conversion routes offer better valorization of the algal biomass but
   have higher costs. A biorefinery combining anaerobic digestion,
   hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction processes would
   provide the maximum possible output from the biomass depending on its
   characteristics. Therefore, the choice must be made in an integrated
   way, aiming at optimizing the quality of the final product to be
   obtained. Life cycle assessment studies are critical for scaling up of
   any algal biomass valorization technique for sustainability. Although
   there are limitations, suitable integrations of these processes would
   enable to make an economically feasible process which require further
   study.

AB A lot of research has been performed on Cyanobacteria and microalgae
   with the aim to produce numerous biotechnological products. However,
   native strains have a few shortcomings, like limitations in cultivation,
   harvesting and product extraction, which prevents reaching optimal
   production value at lowest costs. Such limitations require the
   intervention of genetic engineering to produce strains with superior
   properties. Promising advancements in the cultivation of Cyanobacteria
   and microalgae have been achieved by improving photosynthetic efficiency
   through increasing RuBisCO activity and truncation of light-harvesting
   antennae. Genetic engineering has also contributed to final product
   extraction by inducing autolysis and product secretory systems, to
   enable direct product recovery without going through costly extraction
   steps. In this review, we summarize the different enzymes and pathways
   that have been targeted thus far for improving cultivation aspects,
   harvesting and product extraction in Cyanobacteria and microalgae. With
   synthetic biology advancements, genetically engineered strains can be
   generated to resolve demanding process issues and achieve economic
   practicality. This comprehensive overview of gene modifications will be
   useful to researchers in the field to employ on their strains to
   increase their yields and improve the economic feasibility of the
   production process.

AB Developing clean and renewable energy resources ranks as one of the
   greatest challenges facing mankind in the medium to long term. The
   issues associated with developing non-fossil energy are intimately
   connected with economic development and prosperity, quality of life and
   global stability, and require smart strategies for sustainable
   development. This study presents a relative sustainability assessment of
   biodiesel, taking into account its full life cycle with the main goal of
   comparing alternative feedstocks, either currently used or promising for
   future use such as microalgae. A set of sustainability metrics relevant
   for biodiesel is identified using only the data available in the
   literature and taking into account all the three dimensions of
   sustainability: environmental, societal, and economic. Although this
   study does not attempt to identify which feedstock or process is the
   best, its procedural suggestions may be valuable to practitioners and
   policy makers seeking to identify the best alternatives. The
   conclusions, however, are limited by the availability and the quality of
   the data used in the analyses.

AB This study reviews economics of production of second generation biofuels
   from various feedstocks, including crop and wood/forestry residues,
   lignocellulosic energy crops, jatropha, and algae. The study indicates
   that while second generation biofuels could significantly contribute to
   the future energy supply mix, cost is a major barrier to its commercial
   production in the near to medium term. Depending upon type of biofuels,
   feedstock prices and conversion costs, the cost of cellulosic ethanol is
   found to be two to three times higher than the current price of gasoline
   on an energy equivalent basis. The median cost (across the studies
   reviewed) of biodiesel produced from microalgae, a prospective
   feedstock, is seven times higher than the current price of diesel,
   although much higher cost estimates have been reported. As compared with
   the case of first generation biofuels, in which feedstock can account
   for over two-thirds of the total costs, the share of feedstock in the
   total costs is relatively lower (30-50%) in the case of second
   generation biofuels. While significant cost reductions are needed for
   both types of second generation biofuels, the critical barriers are at
   different steps of the production process. For cellulosic ethanol, the
   biomass conversion costs needs to be reduced. On the other hand,
   feedstock cost is the main issue for biodiesel. At present, policy
   instruments, such as fiscal incentives and consumption mandates have in
   general not differentiated between the first and second generation
   biofuels except in the cases of the US and EU. The policy regime should
   be revised to account for the relative merits of different types of
   biofuels.

U2 15
AB Among the fossil fuels, diesel has the major share in petroleum product
   consumption. Diesel demand in Iran has increasingly grown due to the low
   price of diesel, a high subsidy, and an unsuitable consumption pattern.
   During 2006-2007, this growth imposed 2.2 billion liters of imports,
   which were equivalent to 7.5% of diesel production in 2007 and cost
   about $1.2 billion. Therefore, the government implemented fuel rationing
   in 2007 and a targeted subsidy law in 2010. These projects have not
   gained effective control of consumption due to the wide gap between the
   international diesel price and the domestic price. Diesel import after
   the implementation of fuel rationing and the targeted subsidy law in
   2011 imposed 3.6 billion liters of import and cost about $2.2 billion.
   Therefore, the government will need fundamental strategies and policies
   to face and control the negative impact on the economy and the
   environment. Third generation fuels, biofuels, as another supplementary
   approach seems to have the capability to reduce the petroleum
   requirement. This paper investigates the potential of biodiesel as
   diesel alternative fuel from oil seeds and microalgae in Iran along with
   evaluating the policy for reducing diesel consumption.Dunaliella
   salinaas an indigenous green microalga isolated from the Maharlu Salt
   Lake was cultivated in an integration of an airlift system and a raceway
   pond (IARWP) to prove microalgal potentials in Iran. Additionally, the
   natural culture medium from the Maharlu Salt Lake was utilized
   forDunaliella salinain order to commercialize and reduce cultivation
   cost. Compared to oilseeds, microalgae because of their high lipid
   content have much potential to solve a fuel consumption problem. This
   paper found that only 21 percent of cultivable land is needed to replace
   the diesel currently consumed in Iran with microalgal biodiesel.

AB Development of a low-cost harvesting technology could be an effective
   approach for making microalgal biofuel commercially feasible. The use of
   acid mine drainage (AMD) to coagulate/flocculate biomass is a
   cost-effective strategy for addressing this challenge. Here, settling
   kinetics, flocculation efficiency (FE), and concentration factor (CF) of
   two morphologically different microalgae species, Scenedesmus obliquus
   and Chlorella vulgaris, were investigated with respect to AMD dosage (5%
   and 10%) and medium pH (7 and 9). AMD was collected from two different
   sites, AMD (1) and AMD (2), and increasing its dosage to 10% improved
   the settling rate, FE, and CF of the floc. At 10% AMD (1) dosage and pH
   9, the highest rate constants (k2) for the second order equations were
   6.65*10-2 and 40*10-2 L mg-1.min-1 for S. obliquus and C. vulgaris,
   respectively; at 10% AMD (2), k2 values were 4.22*10-2 and 4.76*10-2 L
   mg-1 min-1, respectively. Similarly, FE/CF values were 89%/25 for S.
   obliquus and 93%/29 for C. vulgaris with 10% AMD (1); and 81%/17 and
   79%/17, respectively, with 10% AMD (2). AMD effectively removed 99.80%
   of Fe3+, 99.99% of Al3+, 94% of Ca2+, 84% of Mg2+ and all of Na+ and K+
   ions from the supernatant. The results of kinetics, EF, and CF
   measurements indicate that AMDs, naturally rich in iron and aluminum
   ions, could provide a feasible option for the harvesting of microalgal
   biomass for biofuel generation.

AB Cyanobacteria are oxygen-evolving photosynthetic bacteria. Established
   genetic manipulation methods and recently developed gene-regulation
   tools have enabled the photosynthetic conversion of carbon dioxide to
   biofuels and valuable chemicals in cyanobacteria, especially in
   unicellular cyanobacteria. However, the oxygen sensitivity of enzyme(s)
   introduced into cyanobacteria hampers productivity in some cases.
   Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is a filamentous cyanobacterium consisting of a
   few hundred of vegetative cells, which perform oxygenic photosynthesis.
   Upon nitrogen deprivation, heterocysts, which are specialized cells for
   nitrogen fixation, are differentiated from vegetative cells at
   semiregular intervals. The micro-oxic environment within heterocysts
   protects oxygen-labile nitrogenase from oxygen. This study aimed to
   repurpose the heterocyst as a host for the production of chemicals with
   oxygen-sensitive enzymes under photosynthetic conditions. Herein,
   Anabaena strains expressing enzymes of 1-butanol synthetic pathway from
   the anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum within heterocysts were created.
   A strain that expressed a highly oxygen-sensitive Bcd/EtfAB complex
   produced 1-butanol even under photosynthetic conditions. Furthermore,
   the 1-butanol production per heterocyst cell of a butanol-producing
   Anabaena strain was fivefold higher than that per cell of unicellular
   cyanobacterium with the same set of 1-butanol synthetic pathway genes.
   Thus, our study showed the usefulness of Anabaena heterocysts as a
   chassis for anaerobic production driven by oxygen-evolving
   photosynthesis.

AB This paper presents the life cycle inventory (LCI) of hydrogen
   production by Clostridium butyricum fermentation of Scenedesmus obliquus
   hydrolysate. The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the potential
   of H2 production from microalgal biomass and the respective energy
   consumption and CO2 emissions in the bioconversion process considering
   the microalga production, acid hydrolysis of S. obliquus biomass,
   preparation of the inoculum and culture media, and fermentation. The
   scale-up to industrial production was not envisaged. The hydrogen yield
   obtained in this work was 2.90.3 mol H2/mol sugars in S. obliquus
   hydrolysate. Results show that this process of biological production of
   hydrogen can achieve 7270 MJ/MJH2 of energy consumption and 670 kg
   CO2/MJH2. The microalgal culture is the stage responsible for 98% of

AB Global water scarcity increased the demand for clean water, leading to
   attention on microalgae-based biological treatment for wastewater due to
   economic feasibility and sustainable biomass applications. This study
   isolated indigenous microalga Coelastrella sp. KNUA068 from a wastewater
   treatment plant, observed its admissible growth rate in diluted cattle
   wastewater (DCW), and used it for wastewater treatment analysis. The
   microalga showed high growth rates in indoor and outdoor cultivation
   with 100% DCW. In addition, the ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen
   removal rates of the microalga were 69.97 and 60.35%, respectively, in
   indoor cultivation, and 50.63 and 67.20%, respectively, in outdoor
   cultivation. Carotenoid content analysis revealed lutein as the highest
   productivity carotenoid, and zeaxanthin production was higher in outdoor
   cultivation. The biomass exhibited suitable biodiesel quality with a
   cetane number of 50.8 for high-quality biodiesel production.
   Coelastrella sp. KNUA068 demonstrates potential for bioenergy feedstock,
   carotenoid production, and wastewater treatment.

AB Microalgae are an attractive source of biomass for fossil fuel
   alternatives and renewable energy sources. Regardless of their
   potential, the development of microalgal biofuels has been limited due
   to the associated economic and environmental costs. We followed and
   compared the biomass properties of sixChlorellaceaestrains with a
   specific interest in lipid-based biofuels. The strains were cultivated
   under balanced nutrient limitation inducing a gradual limitation of
   nutrients that triggered reserve accumulation. The final biomass of each
   strain was characterized by its elemental and biochemical composition.
   Due to its high lipid content and overall composition,Chlorella
   vulgarisNIES 227 was identified as an ideal feedstock for biofuels with
   the best energy-content biomass. Its fatty acid profile also showed
   superior qualities for biodiesel production. Balanced nutrient
   limitation promoted not only the accumulation of storage compounds in
   all strains, but also resulted in a low content of heteroatom precursors
   and ashes for biofuel applications.

AB Pyrolysis is one of important pathways to convert microalgae to liquid
   biofuels and key components of microalgae have different chemical
   composition and structure, which provides a barrier for large-scale
   microalgae-based liquid biofuel application. Microalgae component
   pyrolysis mechanism should be researched to optimal pyrolysis process
   parameters. In this study, single pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of
   microalgal components (model compounds castor oil, soybean protein and
   glucose) were conducted to reveal interaction between them by
   thermogrametric analysis and bio-crude evaluation. Castor oil (model
   compound of lipid) has higher pyrolysis temperature than other model
   compounds and has the maximum contribution to bio-crude formation.
   Bio-crude from soybean protein has higher N-heterocyclic compounds as
   well as phenols, which could be important aromatic hydrocarbon source
   during biorefineries and alternative aviation biofuel production.
   Potential interaction pathways based on model compounds are recommended
   including further decomposition of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) and
   surfactant synthesis, which indicate that glucose played an important
   role on pyrolysis of microalgal protein and lipid components. The
   results should provide necessary information for microalgae pyrolysis
   process optimization and large-scale pyrolysis reactor design.

AB The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is a major model
   species for studies of photosynthesis. It is are also a potential cell
   factory for the production of renewable biofuels and valuable chemicals.
   We employed engineered riboswitches to control translational initiation
   of target genes in this cyanobacterium. A firefly luciferase reporter
   assay revealed that three theophylline riboswitches performed as
   expected in the cyanobacterium. Riboswitch-E* exhibited very low leaky
   expression of luciferase and superior and dose-dependent on/off
   regulation of protein expression by theophylline. The maximum magnitude
   of the induction vs. basal level was 190-fold. Furthermore, the
   induction level was responsive to a wide range of theophylline
   concentrations in the medium, from 0 to 2 mM, facilitating the
   fine-tuning of luciferase expression. We adapted this riboswitch to
   another gene regulation system, in which expression of the circadian
   clock kaiC gene product is controlled by the theophylline concentration
   in the culture medium. The results demonstrated that the adequately
   adjusted expression level of KaiC restored complete circadian rhythm in
   the kaiC-deficient arrhythmic mutant. This theophylline-dependent
   riboswitch system has potential for various applications as a useful
   genetic tool in cyanobacteria.

AB Microalgae are a promising aquatic culture for supplying biofuels and
   other bioproducts in the near- to medium-term. For this potential to
   develop into reality, an interesting alternative is to couple microalgae
   production with large-scale facilities in order to benefit from process
   integration. This review aims at analyzing the main inputs of microalgae
   cultivation and how they could be supplied by integrated biorefineries,
   namely carbon source, nutrients, water use, plant location and
   geographic conditions. A special focus is given to Brazilian sugarcane
   mills acting as hosting complexes for microalgal biomass production.
   Such industrial plants are able to supply cheap carbon for microalgae
   growth in the form of CO2from boiler emissions, ethanol fermentation
   off-gas, or biogas from vinasse anaerobic digestion; water, organic
   molecules, and nutrients fromin naturaor processed vinasse; and
   renewable electrical energy obtained from sugarcane bagasse and straw
   burning. The effects of the location of possible sugarcane-microalgae
   biorefineries are also discussed, particularly points related to land
   suitability and availability in Brazil.

AB Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in human
   health. Due to the increased market demand, the production of PUFAs from
   potential alternative sources such as microalgae is receiving increased
   interest. The aim of this study was to perform a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) of the biotechnological production of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
   from the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, followed by the
   identification of avenues to improve its environmental profile. The LCA
   tackles two production schemes of P. tricornutum PUFAs with an EPA
   content of 36%: lab and pilot scales. The results at lab scale show that
   both the electricity requirements and the production of the extraction
   agent (chloroform) have significant influence on the life cycle
   environmental performance of microalgal EPA production. An alternative
   method based on hexane was proposed to replace chloroform and
   environmental benefits were identified. Regarding the production of EPA
   at pilot scale, three main environmental factors were identified: the
   production of the nitrogen source required for microalgae growing, the
   transport activities and electricity requirements. Improvement
   alternatives were proposed and discussed concerning: (a) the use of
   nitrogen based fertilizers, (b) the valorization of the residual algal
   paste as soil conditioner and, (c) the anaerobic digestion of the
   residual algal paste for bioenergy production. Encouraging environmental
   benefits could be achieved if sodium nitrate was substituted by urea,
   calcium nitrate or ammonium nitrate, regardless the category under
   assessment. In contrast, minor improvement was found when valorizing the
   residual algal paste as mineral fertilizer, due to its overall low
   content in N and P. Concerning the biogas production from the anaerobic
   digestion, the improvement on the environmental profile was also limited
   due to the discrepancy between the potential energy production from the
   algal paste and the high electricity requirements in the culturing and
   extraction stages.

AB The search for biofuels has been driven in recent decades due to concern
   over the depletion of non-renewable energetic sources. This literature
   review provides an approach to the application of microorganisms for the
   production of bioethanol, with emphasis on microalgae. The high
   efficiency of photosynthetic conversion, rapid growth, the possibility
   of manipulation of the medium to produce biomass with high fat and
   carbohydrates, and the use of areas with low agricultural potential of
   microalgae are one of the most promising raw materials for the
   production of biofuels. The existence of a large variety of methods for
   obtaining microalgal and subsequent production of bioethanol, biomass
   stimulated numerous studies to increase the production potential and
   improve the process. Studies show that for the production of bioethanol
   achieve economic viability, production of algal biomass should also aim
   at obtaining other compounds with higher added value, such as pigments,
   proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, according to the concept of
   integrated biorefineries.

U2 99
AB Current interest on growing microalgae for CO2 mitigation has received
   overwhelming response from research, mainly due to their high
   photosynthetic rate that allow them to bio-fix CO2 more efficient than
   terrestrial crops. In the present study, two types of carbon source,
   namely CO2 bubbling and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) were used to grow
   freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. It was found that CO2 bubbling
   could accelerate 5.2 times higher biomass productivity compared to
   NaHCO3, however, significantly lower in term of CO2 removal efficiency.
   Interestingly, when NaHCO3 was supplied as carbon source, C. vulgaris
   preferred to utilize free CO2 molecules at acidic cultivation condition
   (pH 4) instead of bicarbonate ions at alkaline conditions (pH 8.5) with
   CO2 removal efficiency of 82.5-99%. To overcome the limitation of low
   solubility of CO2 in water, sequential photobioreactors were
   successfully developed in this study that gave five times more CO2
   removal efficiency than a single photobioreactor. Furthermore, this
   study also explored the potential of re-utilizing the water used for
   cultivation (without additional treatment) for subsequent cycle of
   cultivation and the result showed a higher biomass productivity and CO2
   fixation rate as compared to fresh water. The lipid extracted from C.
   vulgaris supplied with air/CO2 or NaHCO3 were mostly unsaturated fatty
   acids, which are suitable for biodiesel production.

AB Nitrogen deprivation (-N) has been used as a technique to promote lipid
   accumulation in various microalgae. Scenedesmus acutus is a promising
   oleaginous green microalga that can be cultivated in organic wastewater
   for biodiesel production. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms
   controlling S. acutus lipid accumulation in response to -N remain
   unidentified. Physiological study determined that -N reduced cell growth
   and photosynthetic pigments. On the other hand, it promoted carbohydrate
   and neutral lipid accumulation. To find the mechanisms underlying lipid
   accumulation, we performed de novo transcriptome profiling of the
   non-model S. acutus in response to -N. The transcriptome analysis
   revealed that glycolysis and starch degradation were up-regulated; on
   the contrary, gluconeogenesis, photosynthesis, triacylglycerol (TAG)
   degradation and starch synthesis were down-regulated by -N. Under -N,
   the carbon flux was shifted toward fatty acid and TAG synthesis, and the
   down regulation of TAG lipase genes may contribute to TAG accumulation.
   A comparative analysis of the -N transcriptomes of oleaginous microalgae
   identified that the down-regulation of multiple lipase genes was a
   specific mechanism found only in the -N transcriptome of S. acutus. Our
   study unraveled the mechanisms controlling -N-induced lipid accumulation
   in S. acutus, and provided new perspectives for the genetic manipulation
   of biodiesel-producing microalgae.

AB In the recent years, microalgae have captured researchers' attention as
   the alternative feedstock for various bioenergy production such as
   biodiesel, biohydrogen, and bioethanol. Cultivating microalgae in
   wastewaters to simultaneously bioremediate the nutrient-rich wastewater
   and maintain a high biomass yield is a more economical and
   environmentally friendly approach. The incorporation of algal-bacterial
   interaction reveals the mutual relationship of microorganisms where
   algae are primary producers of organic compounds from CO2, and
   heterotrophic bacteria are secondary consumers decomposing the organic
   compounds produced from algae. This review would provide an insight on
   the challenges and future development of algal-bacterial consortium and
   its contribution in promoting a sustainable route to greener industry.
   It is believed that microalgal-bacterial consortia will be implemented
   in the near-future for sub-sequential treatment of wastewater
   bioremediation, bioenergy production and CO2 fixation, promoting
   sustainability and making extraordinary advancement in life sciences
   sectors.

AB An indigenous microalga was isolated from the springs in Cuatro
   Cienegas, Mexico. It was morphologically identified as Scenedesmus
   obtusiusculus and cultivated in bubble-column photobioreactors in batch
   operation mode. This microalga grows at 10% of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   showing a maximum CO2 fixation rate of 970 g m-3 d-1. The microalga,
   without any nutrient limitation, contained 20% of nonpolar lipids with a
   biomass productivity of 500 g m-3 d-1 and a maximum biomass
   concentration of around 6,000 g m-3 at 5% CO2 and irradiance of 134 mol
   m-2 s-1. Furthermore, it was observed that the microalga stored 55.7% of
   nonpolar lipids when 5% CO2 was fed at 0.8 vvm and 54.7 mol m-2 s-1
   under nitrogen starvation. The lipid profile included C16:0, C18:0,
   C18:1n9t, C18:1n9c, C18:3n6 with a productivity of 200 g lipid m-3 d-1.
   Therefore, the microalga may have biotechnological potential producing
   lipids for biodiesel.

AB Exploitation of renewable sources of energy such as algal biodiesel
   could turn energy supplies problem around. Studies on a locally isolated
   strain of Dunaliella sp. showed that the mean lipid content in cultures
   enriched by 200 mg L-1 myoinositol was raised by around 33% (1.5 times
   higher than the control). Similarly, higher lipid productivity values
   were achieved in cultures treated by 100 and 200 mg L-1 myoinositol.
   Fluorometry analyses (microplate fluorescence and flow cytometry)
   revealed increased oil accumulation in the Nile red-stained algal
   samples. Moreover, it was predicted that biodiesel produced from
   myoinositol-treated cells possessed improved oxidative stability, cetane
   number, and cloud point values. From the genomic point of view,
   real-time analyses revealed that myoinositol negatively influenced
   transcript abundance of AccD gene (one of the key genes involved in
   lipid production pathway) due to feedback inhibition and that its
   positive effect must have been exerted through other genes. The findings
   of the current research are not to interpret that myoinositol
   supplementation could answer all the challenges faced in microalgal
   biodiesel production but instead to show that "there is a there there"
   for biochemical modulation strategies, which we achieved, increased
   algal oil quantity and enhanced resultant biodiesel quality.

AB The interest in microalgae for wastewater treatment and liquid bio-fuels
   production (i.e. biodiesel and bioethanol) is steadily increasing due to
   the energy demand of the ultra-modern technological world. The
   associated biomass and by-product residues generated from these
   processes can be utilized as a feedstock in anaerobic fermentation for
   the production of gaseous bio-fuels. In this context, dark fermentation
   coupled with anaerobic digestion can be a potential technology for the
   production of hydrogen and methane from these residual algal biomasses.
   The mixture of these gaseous bio-fuels, known as hythane, has superior
   characteristics and is increasingly regarded as an alternative to fossil
   fuels. This review provides the current developments achieved in the
   conversion of algal biomass to bio-hythane (H2 + CH4).

U1 0
U2 58
AB Chlorellasp., as a kind of microalgae with high proteins content and
   rigid cell walls, is a potential material for proteins recovery as
   poultry feed supplement source. This study proposed an algal biorefinery
   paradigm for sequent production of proteins and biogas from
   microalgaeChlorellasp. via CO2assisted hydrothermal treatment and
   anaerobic digestion. The CO2could be sustainably refilled as being a
   bioproduct of biogas. As a widely-used environmentally benign
   hydrothermal catalyst, the addition of CO2could reduce treatment
   temperature and CO2is easily removed by depressurizing. Microalgal cells
   were more disrupted with rising temperature from 70°C to 150°C, which
   facilitated the recovery of proteins. The recovery of proteins increased
   from 6.32% to 69.81%. After proteins recovery, the C/N ratio of
   microalgal residues was significantly higher than the
   untreatedChlorellasp. The process of proteins recovery could relieve the
   hydrolysis limitation of cell walls but reduce organics remained in
   microalgal residues. Biomethane production from microalgal residues
   exhibited a similar rising trend to proteins recovery. The highest
   cumulative biomethane production of 194.63 mL/gVS was achieved for the
   group at 130°C, and the lowest value of 104.42 mL/gVS was obtained for
   the group at 70°C. Excess microalgal cells disruption and side reactions
   led to the poor biomethane performance for the group at 150°C,
   consistent with the decreased proteins recovery. During anaerobic
   digestion, the concentration of acetic acid distributed in a range of
   0.05-0.44 g/L, which was dominant among total volatile fatty acids. The
   proteins as poultry feed supplement would be preferable to be considered
   as the main product, and the biomethane was considered as the side
   product. Carbon balance analysis revealed that most groups could
   basically meet the CO2demand for HTT except the group at 150°C. 130°C
   was considered as the favorable treatment temperature level, leading to
   a proteins yield of 0.41 g/gVS and biomethane yield of 91.47 mL/gVS

AB Microalgae have caught the world's attention for its potential to solve
   one of the world's most pressing issues - sustainable green energy.
   Compared to biofuels supplied by oil palm, rapeseed, soybean and sugar
   cane, microalgae alone can be manipulated to generate larger amounts of
   biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen and biomass in a shorter time. Apart
   from higher productivity, microalgae can also grow using brackish water
   on non-arable land, greatly reducing the competition with food and cash
   crops. Hence, numerous efforts have been put into the commercialisation
   of microalgae-derived biofuel by both the government and private bodies.
   This paper serves to review conventional and novel methods for
   microalgae culture and biomass harvest, as well as recent developments
   in techniques for microalgal biofuel production.

AB Microalgae have been identified as a potential biodiesel feedstock due
   to their high lipid productivity and potential for cultivation on
   marginal land. One of the challenges in utilizing microalgae to make
   biodiesel is the complexities of extracting the lipids using organic
   solvents followed by transesterification of the extracts to biodiesel.
   In the present work, reaction conditions were optimized that allow a
   single step extraction and conversion to biodiesel in high yield from
   microalgae. From the optimized conditions, it is demonstrated that
   quantitative conversion of triglycerides from several different
   microalgae and cyanobacteria could be achieved, including from mixed
   microbial biomass collected from a municipal wastewater lagoon. Evidence
   is presented that for some samples, significantly more biodiesel can be
   produced than would be expected from available triglycerides, indicating
   conversion of fatty acids contained in other molecules (e.g.,
   phospholipids) using this approach. The effectiveness of the approach on
   wet algae is also reported.

U1 5
U2 73
AB Water usage increased alongside its competitiveness due to its finite
   amount. Yet, many industries still rely on this finite resource thus
   recalling the need to recirculate their water for production. Circular
   bioeconomy is presently the new approach emphasizing on the
   'end-of-life' concept with reusing, recycling, and recovering materials.
   Microalgae are the ideal source contributing to circular bioeconomy as
   it exhibits fast growth and adaptability supported by biological
   rigidity which in turn consumes nutrients, making it an ideal and
   capable bioremediating agent, therefore allowing water re-use as well as
   its biomass potential in biorefineries. Nevertheless, there are
   challenges that still need to be addressed with consideration of recent
   advances in cultivating microalgae in wastewater. This review aimed to
   investigate the potential of microalgae biomass cultivated in
   wastewater. More importantly, how it'll play a role in the circular
   bioeconomy. This includes an in-depth look at the production of goods
   coming from wastes tattered by emerging pollutants. These emerging
   pollutants include microplastics, antibiotics, ever-increasingly sewage
   water, and heavy metals which have not been comprehensively compared and
   explored. Therefore, this review is aiming to bring new insights to
   researchers and industrial stakeholders with interest in green
   alternatives to eventually contribute towards environmental
   sustainability.

U1 2
U2 34
AB There exists a global challenge of feeding the growing human population
   of the world and supplying its energy needs without exhausting global
   resources. This challenge includes the competition for biomass between
   food and fuel production. The aim of this paper is to review to what
   extent the biomass of plants growing under hostile conditions and on
   marginal lands could ease that competition. Biomass from salt-tolerant
   algae and halophytes has shown potential for bioenergy production on
   salt-affected soils. Halophytes and algae could provide a bio-based
   source for lignoceelusic biomass and fatty acids or an alternative for
   edible biomass currently produced using fresh water and agricultural
   lands. The present paper provides an overview of the opportunities and
   challenges in the development of alternative fuels from halophytes and
   algae. Halophytes grown on marginal and degraded lands using saline
   water offer an additional material for commercial-scale biofuel
   production, especially bioethanol. At the same time, suitable strains of
   microalgae cultured under saline conditions can be a particularly good
   source of biodiesel, although the efficiency of their mass-scale biomass
   production is still a concern in relation to environmental protection.
   This review summaries the pitfalls and precautions for producing biomass
   in a way that limits environmental hazards and harms for coastal
   ecosystems. Some new algal and halophytic species with great potential
   as sources of bioenergy are highlighted.

AB Background: Microbial bioconversion of photosynthetic biomass is a
   promising approach to the generation of biofuels and other bioproducts.
   However, rapid, high-yield, and simple processes are essential for
   successful applications. Here, biomass from the rapidly growing
   photosynthetic marine cyanobacteriumSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 was
   fermented using yeast into bioethanol. Results: The cyanobacterium
   accumulated a total carbohydrate content of about 60% of cell dry weight
   when cultivated under nitrate limitation. The cyanobacterial cells were
   harvested by centrifugation and subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using
   lysozyme and two alpha-glucanases. This enzymatic hydrolysate was
   fermented into ethanol bySaccharomyces cerevisiaewithout further
   treatment. All enzyme treatments and fermentations were carried out in
   the residual growth medium of the cyanobacteria with the only
   modification being that pH was adjusted to the optimal value. The
   highest ethanol yield and concentration obtained was 0.27 g ethanol per
   g cell dry weight and 30 g ethanol L-1, respectively. About 90% of the
   glucose in the biomass was converted to ethanol. The cyanobacterial
   hydrolysate was rapidly fermented (up to 20 g ethanol L-1day-1) even in
   the absence of any other nutrient additions to the fermentation medium.
   Conclusions: Cyanobacterial biomass was hydrolyzed using a simple
   enzymatic treatment and fermented into ethanol more rapidly and to
   higher concentrations than previously reported for similar approaches
   using cyanobacteria or microalgae. Importantly, as well as fermentable
   carbohydrates, the cyanobacterial hydrolysate contained additional
   nutrients that promoted fermentation. This hydrolysate is therefore a
   promising substitute for the relatively expensive nutrient additives
   (such as yeast extract) commonly used forSaccharomycesfermentations.

AB As the world's population grows, it is necessary to rethink how
   countries throughout the world produce food in order to replace the
   conventional and unsustainable agricultural techniques. Microalgae
   cultivation using a nutrient-rich solution from hydroponic systems not
   only presents a novel approach to solving problems pertaining to the
   impact of the discharges on the natural environment but also provides a
   plethora of other biotechnological applications particularly in the
   productions of high value-added products and plants growth stimulants,
   which can be potentially assimilated into the circular bioeconomy (CBE)
   in the hydroponic sector. In this review, the potential and
   practicability of microalgae to be merged into hydroponics CBE are
   reviewed. Overall, the integration of microalgal biorefineries in
   hydroponics systems can be realized after considering their Technology
   Readiness Level and System Readiness Level beforehand. Several
   suggestions on strains and hydroponics system improvement using existing
   biotechnological tools, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
   nanobiotechnology in support of the CBE will be covered.

AB Developing microbial consortia emerges as a new research frontier since
   complementing metabolisms provides new biotechnological capabilities for
   symbiotic interaction. To date, microalgal consortia with other
   microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria, or other microalga are
   considered a biotechnological strategy to enhance microalgal
   physiological performance during CO2removal from biogas-a gaseous
   by-product composed mainly of methane (CH4, 65-70%) and CO2(25-30%)
   considered an energy source due to its high methane content. Today,
   microalga-microorganism interaction studies have focused on developing
   diverse microbial consortia to increase CO2fixation of biogas and their
   metabolic changes during processing time. Thus, the present review
   proposes in a novel way the use of microalgal growth-promoting bacteria
   (MGPB) as a suitable partner to boost microalgal physiological
   performance and positively influence CO2fixation from biogas.
   Furthermore, the MGPB mechanisms involved during MGPB-microalga
   interaction to mitigate or regulate microalgae metabolism under the
   stressful condition of this gaseous effluent and improve their
   biotechnological uses focusing on CO2removal from biogas are analyzed
   and proposed. Additionally, the microalgal ability to convert CO2from
   biogas into high-value biotechnological compounds of commercial interest
   is analyzed, including the economic feasibility and scalability of a
   microalga-MGPB consortium. This physiological knowledge of
   microalga-MGPG consortia notably warrants its real impact on different
   economic sectors as a bio-economy overview. Furthermore, the discussion
   between engineering and biological sciences facilitates the development
   of suitable bioprocesses based on microalgae.

AB The lipid contents and fatty acid profiles of Chlorella zofingiensis
   cultured in the dark with various carbon sources were investigated.
   Glucose was found to be the best carbon source for the growth and lipid
   production. When cultivated with 50 g L-1 glucose, C. zofingiensis
   accumulated lipids up to 52% of the dry biomass, with triacylglycerols
   (TAGs) accounting for 72.1% of the total lipids. Fatty acid profiles
   revealed that glucose contributed to the highest yield of total fatty
   acids (TFAs) and proportion of oleic acid (35.7% of TFAs), which
   corresponded to the strongest up-regulation of biotin carboxylase (BC)
   and stearoyl ACP desaturase (SAD) genes. In fed-batch cultivation based
   on glucose, the lipid yield and productivity of C. zofingiensis were
   further increased to 20.7 g L-1 and 1.38 g d-1 L-1 respectively,
   representing 3.9-fold of those achieved in batch culture. We conclude
   that C. zofingiensis has great potential for biodiesel production.

U2 17
AB Managing wastewater and using renewable energy sources are challenges in
   achieving sustainable development goals. This study provides an overview
   of the factors influencing the performance of algae-based membrane
   bioreactors (AMBRs) for contaminant removal from wastewater and biogas
   production. This review highlights that the performance of AMBRs in
   removing total phosphorus (TP) and nitrogen (N) from wastewater can
   reach up to 93% and 97%, respectively, depending on parameters such as
   pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and algae concentration. Moreover,
   the removal of H2S from biogas substantially depends on the type of
   bioreactor used. Furthermore, algal biomass has proven to be a viable
   option for biogas production and CO2 sequestration, contributing to
   carbon neutrality. This review also underscores that microalgae are a
   valuable feedstock, either alone or in combination with other raw
   materials, for biogas production. In conclusion, this review outlines
   that maximizing the performance of bioreactors and the efficiency of
   microalgae used for biogas production and wastewater treatment requires
   careful control of parameters, such as HRT, solid retention time, pH,
   and temperature. Additionally, pH and the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N)
   are factors influencing CH4 yield during microalgae anaerobic digestion
   (AD). Further research is needed to evaluate the operational costs of
   AMBRs used for wastewater treatment and to compare the biogas yield from
   different types of bioreactors under similar conditions, including the
   use of the same feedstock.

AB Aquacultures of microalgae are frontrunners for photosynthetic capture
   of CO2from flue gases. Expedient implementation mandates coupling of
   microalgal CO2capture with synthesis of fuels and organic products, so
   as to derive value from biomass. An integrated biorefinery complex
   houses a biomass growth and harvesting area and a refining zone for
   conversion to product(s) and separation to desired purity levels. As
   growth and downstream options require energy and incur loss of carbon,
   put together, the loop must be energy positive, carbon negative, or add
   substantial value. Feasibility studies can, thus, aid the choice from
   among the rapidly evolving technological options, many of which are
   still in the early phases of development. We summarize basic engineering
   calculations for the key steps of a biorefining loop where flue gases
   from a thermal power station are captured using microalgal biomass along
   with subsequent options for conversion to fuel or value added products.
   An assimilation of findings from recent laboratory and pilot-scale
   experiments and life cycle analysis (LCA) studies is presented as carbon
   and energy yields for growth and harvesting of microalgal biomass and
   downstream options. Of the biorefining options, conversion to the widely
   studied biofuel, ethanol, and manufacture of the platform chemical,
   succinic acid are presented. Both processes yield specific products and
   do not demand high-energy input but entail 60-70% carbon loss through
   fermentative respiration. Thermochemical conversions, on the other hand,
   have smaller carbon and energy losses but yield a mixture of products.

AB Offshore cultivation of seaweed provides an innovative feedstock for
   biobased products supporting blue growth in northern Europe. This paper
   analyzes two alternative exploitation pathways: energy and protein
   production. The first pathway is based on anaerobic digestion of seaweed
   which is converted into biogas, for production of electricity and heat,
   and digestate, used as fertilizer; the second pathway uses seaweed
   hydrolysate as a substrate for cultivation of heterotrophic microalgae.
   As a result the seaweed sugars are consumed while new proteins are
   produced enhancing the total output. We performed a comparative Life
   Cycle Assessment of five scenarios identifying the critical features
   affecting resource efficiency and environmental performance of the
   systems with the aim of providing decision support for the design of
   future industrial scale production processes. The results show that all
   scenarios provide environmental benefits in terms of mitigation of
   climate change, with biogas production from driedLaminaria digitatabeing
   the most favorable scenario, quantified as -18.7*102kg CO2eq./ha. This
   scenario presents also the lowest consumption of total cumulative energy
   demand, 1.7*104MJ/ha, and even resulting in a net reduction of the
   fossil energy fraction, -1.9*104MJ/ha compared to a situation without
   seaweed cultivation. All scenarios provide mitigation of marine
   eutrophication thanks to bioextraction of nitrogen and phosphorus during
   seaweed growth. The material consumption for seeded lines has 2-20 times
   higher impact on human toxicity (cancer) than the reduction achieved by
   energy and protein substitution. However, minor changes in cultivation
   design, i.e. use of stones instead of iron as ballast to weight the
   seeded lines, dramatically reduces human toxicity (cancer).
   Externalities from the use of digestate as fertilizer affect human
   toxicity (non-cancer) due to transfer of arsenic from aquatic
   environment to agricultural soil. However concentration of heavy metals
   in digestate does not exceed the limit established by Danish regulation.
   The assessment identifies seaweed productivity as the key parameter to
   further improve the performance of the production systems which are a
   promising service provider of environmental restoration and climate
   change mitigation.

AB Scarcity and non-renewable nature of petroleum based liquid fuels have
   made them an un-reliable source of energy. Excessive greenhouse gas
   emissions and the associated effects on global warming have become
   noteworthy environmental, economic and social threats. In this milieu,
   the development of renewable, carbon-neutral and sustainable alternative
   energy sources has become inevitable. Biofuels have been found a
   promising alternative and a driving force for modern world. Different
   feed-stocks have been evaluated for biofuels production to date but
   microalgae have been found the most attractive due to their higher
   growth productivity, higher lipid contents, non-competitive nature with
   human food and their ability to grow on non-arable land using brackish
   or waste water. However, there are a number of technological barriers
   that are still questioning the economic feasibility and competitiveness
   of such biofuels. On the other hand, there are also a number of trade
   opportunities if we pay attention to the use of integrated system
   following the bio-refinery concept. Bio-refinery concept reflects the
   production of value added by-products along with the biofuels,
   contributing to an overall escalation of the economic feasibility of the
   whole system. These types of systems may help to progress the
   competitiveness of biodiesel production using microalgae as a potential
   feedstock. This paper reviews the most recent and relevant information
   on such integrated systems. Several aspects related to the treatment of
   municipal and animal wastewater with simultaneous recovery of microalgae
   and the potential of biodiesel production are discussed. Bio-refinery
   concept also presenting new opportunities for the cost-effective
   production of biodiesel coupled with valuable non-fuel by-products.

AB Promising energy crops such asJatropha curcas Linnaeus(JCL), which are
   planted on marginal lands, or microalgae such asChlorella, which are
   cultivated in ponds located on mudflats or deserts, have been regarded
   with high hopes to solve the shortage of food crops and increase the
   amount of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester, FAME) production. However,
   the annual yields of biomass and transport fuels (t/ha) of both are
   still unclear and often exaggerated in the literature. Large portions
   ofJCLbiomass, including tree trunks and leaves, can also be used to
   generate electricity along with FAME, which is produced from seed
   lipids. Meanwhile, lipid extracted algae (LEA) is composed of proteins,
   polysaccharides and lipids other than glycerides which are unable to be
   esterified to form FAME and much more abundant in the microalgae than
   oil cake in the oil crops. Therefore, it was strongly suggested that not
   only transesterification or esterification but also Fischer-Tropsch (FT)
   process and bio-electricity generation should be considered as routes to
   produce biofuels. Otherwise, the yield of biofuel would be extremely low
   using eitherJCLorChlorellaas feedstock. The life-cycle inventories (LCI)
   of the biofuel processes with whole biomass ofJCLandChlorellawere
   compared based on their net energy ratio (NER) and CO2emission saving
   (CES). It was shown that the technological improvement of irrigation,
   cultivation and processing for either economic-crops or microalgae are
   all necessary to meet the requirements of commercial biofuel production.

AB The microalgae can be converted into biofuels, biochemicals, and
   bioactive compounds in a biorefinery. Recently, designing and executing
   more viable and sustainable biofuel production from microalgal biomass
   is one of the vital challenges in the development of biorefinery.
   Scalable cultivation of microalgae is mandatory for commercializing and
   industrializing the biorefinery. The intrinsic complication in
   cultivation of microalgae is the physiological and operational factors
   that renders challenging impact to enable a smooth and profitable
   operation. However, this aim can only be successful via a simulation
   prospect. Machine learning tools provides advanced approaches for
   evaluating, predicting, and controlling uncertainties in microalgal
   biorefinery for sustainable biofuel production. The present review
   provides a critical evaluation of the most progressing machine learning
   tools that validate a potential to be employed in microalgal
   biorefinery. These tools are highly potential for their extensive
   evaluation on microalgal screening and classification. However, the
   application of these tools for optimization of microalgal biomass
   cultivation in industries in order to increase the biomass production,
   is still in its initial stages. Integrated hybrid machine learning tools
   can aid the industries to function efficiently with least resources.
   Some of the challenges, and perspectives of machine learning tools are
   discussed. Besides, future prospects are also emphasized. Though, most
   of the research reports on machine learning tools are not appropriate to
   gather generalized information, standard protocols and strategies must
   be developed to design generalized machine learning tools. On a whole,
   this review offers a perspective information about digitalized
   microalgal exploitation in a microalgal biorefinery.

AB The stagnant development of microalgae-based industries suggests a need
   for a broader assessment of its commercial potential, particularly given
   its ability to utilize industrial waste effluents in cultivation and
   produce multiple outputs from the biomass, including an environmentally
   superior biofuel. This study assessed the financial feasibility of
   producing microalgae biodiesel from transesterification, together with
   feed and fertilizer in a multi-output production system, integrated with
   a complementary waste-producing industry. The multi-output system
   allowed for the price of biodiesel to be sold at the competitive market
   price of US$1.50/L rather than US$24.18/L, if it were produced as the
   only primary output. The high-value feed and fertilizer offset the low
   revenues of biodiesel to ensure the financial feasibility of the
   production system. Sensitivity analyses of these estimates indicated
   where improvements could further increase the financial appeal of this
   multi-output microalgae production system. In particular, a 20%
   improvement in the cost-efficiency of lipid extraction and
   transesterification processes was found to have a 17-fold increase in
   the net present value. The results suggest that multi-output systems
   have several benefits for the potential of a microalgae-based industry,
   namely the synergistic benefits of integrating microalgae production
   with complementary industries and the investment appeal of
   microalgae-based biofuels that can be priced competitively while still
   being financial feasible. Although alternative conversion processes
   (e.g. fermentation and thermochemical routes) would be key to the
   increased cost-efficiency of biofuel production, the development of
   integrated multi-output microalgae industries could prompt private and
   more importantly, policy-led investment in development of the industry.

AB The potential of algal biomass as a source of liquid and gaseous
   biofuels is a highly topical theme, The process operations for algal
   biofuel production can be grouped into three areas: growth, harvesting
   and energy extraction, with a wide range of combinations of unit
   operations that can form a microalgal biofuel production system, but as
   yet there is no successful economically viable commercial system
   producing biofuel. This suggests that there are major technical and
   engineering difficulties to be resolved before economic algal biofuel
   production can be achieved. This article briefly reviews the methods by
   which useful energy may be extracted from microalgae biomass: (a) direct
   combustion, (b) pyrolysis, (c) gasification, (d) liquefaction, (e)
   hydrogen production by biochemical processes in certain algae, (f) fuel
   cells, (g) fermentation to bioethanol, (h) trans-esterification to
   biodiesel, (i) anaerobic digestion.

AB This work for the first time investigated lipid accumulation by a
   two-stage regime namely heterotrophic-Cu(II) stressed (HCuS) and
   underlying molecular basis of lipid biosynthesis in Chlorella
   protothecoides cells. The results showed that the optimized biomass and
   lipid yield were achieved by 6.47 g/L and 5.78 g/L with this strategy.
   The fatty acids compositions (almost 100% of them are C15 to C20) are
   ideal for preparing high quality biodiesel. Further, 30 differentially
   expressed proteins response to HCuS were involved in carbohydrate
   metabolism, carbon fixation, TCA cycle, lipid metabolism, protein
   biosynthesis, transportation and regulation, ATP and RNA biosynthesis,
   nucleotide metabolism, ROS scavenging. Especially, glycolysis pathway
   might be the important contributor for lipid accumulation. In future,
   further functional analysis of these altered proteins would help to
   reveal more concerning lipid biosynthesis pathway.

AB Microalgae has large scale cultivation history particularly in
   aquaculture, pigments and nutraceutical production. Despite the
   advantages of microalgal oil as feedstock for biodiesel production,
   algal biodiesel is still at laboratory scale due to technical challenges
   required to be overcome to make it economical and sustainable. Indeed,
   complete drying of microalgae is energy intensive and significantly
   increases the cost of algae pre-treatment.In situtransesterification is
   more water tolerant due to excess methanol to oil molar ratio required
   by such production route. However, the need to remove unreacted methanol
   (>94% of it) from the product streams certainly requires distillation
   heat load which increases the operating cost. This article reviews the
   key process variables affecting efficiency ofin situtransesterification.
   These include alcohol to oil molar ratio, moisture, stirring rate,
   reaction time, temperature, microalgal cell wall and catalyst type.
   Potential solutions of improving the efficiency/economy are discussed.
   Overall, an integrated approach ofin situdimethyl ether (DME) production
   along with the desired biodiesel synthesis duringin
   situtransesterification would substantially reduce the volume of
   unreacted methanol thereby reduces operating cost. Use of resulting
   microalgal residue for biogas (methane) production can provide energy
   for biomass production/separation from the dilute algae-water mixture.
   Use of bio-digestate as nutrients for supporting microalgal growth is
   among the probable solutions suggested for reducing the production cost
   ofin situtransesterification.

AB In the current scenario, biofuels based on algae, including
   cyanobacteria, are expensive, complex to produce, and are only just
   entering the commercial phase in small quantities in pilot or
   demonstration plants. This chapter discusses the current scenario of
   using cyanobacteria for the production of liquid transportation
   biofuels. The chapter talks about feasibility and economic challenges
   associated with scaling up of the biotechnological processes. Hydrogen
   energy is an attractive alternative energy source. Microbial hydrogen
   production can either be mediated by light (e.g., photosynthetic
   bacteria including cyanobacteria; photo-hydrogen production), or be
   derived from fermentation of organic sources in the dark (e.g., using
   members of Enterobacteriaceae). Cyanobacteria-mediated hydrogen
   production has many advantages over other biological and non-biological
   processes. In general, the lipid content of cyanobacteria is too low for
   commercial-scale biodiesel production.

U1 13
U2 63
AB Oleaginous microalgae have been considered promising sources of
   biodiesel due to their high lipid content. Nitrogen
   limitation/starvation is one of the most prominent strategies to induce
   lipid accumulation in microalgae. Nonetheless, despite numerous studies,
   the mechanism underlying this approach is not well understood. The aim
   of this study was to investigate the effect of nitrogen limitation and
   starvation on biochemical and morphological changes in the microalga
   Chlorella vulgaris FACHB-1068, thereby obtaining the optimal nitrogen
   stress strategy for maximizing the lipid productivity of microalgal
   biomass. The results showed that nitrogen limitation (nitrate
   concentration < 21.66 mg/L) and starvation enhanced the lipid content
   but generally decreased the biomass productivity, pigment concentration,
   and protein content in algal cells. Comparatively, 3-day nitrogen
   starvation was found to be a more suitable strategy to produce
   lipid-rich biomass. It resulted in an increased biomass production and
   satisfactory lipid content of 266 mg/L and 31.33%, respectively.
   Besides, nitrogen starvation caused significant changes in cell
   morphology, with an increase in numbers and total size of lipid droplets
   and starch granules. Under nitrogen starvation, saturated fatty acids
   (C-16:0, C-20:0, and C-18:0) accounted for the majority of the total
   fatty acids (~80%), making C. vulgaris FACHB-1068 a potential feedstock
   for biodiesel production. Our work may contribute to a better
   understanding of the biochemical and morphological changes in microalgae
   under nitrogen stress. Besides, our work may provide valuable
   information on increasing the lipid productivity of oleaginous
   microalgae by regulating nitrogen supply.

   recent developments in cell disruption and astaxanthin extraction
   techniques applied usingH. pluvialisas a model species for large-scale

   with a rigid three-layered cell wall during astaxanthin accumulation
   (~4% of dry weight) under stress. The thick (~2 m), acetolysis-resistant
   cell wall forms the strongest barrier to astaxanthin extraction. Various

   (wet, dry, and live), cell-disruption efficacy, astaxanthin
   extractability, cost, scalability, synergistic combinations, and impact
   on the stress-sensitive astaxanthin content. The challenges and future
   prospects of the downstream processes for the sustainable and economic

AB Development of advanced biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel from
   renewable resources is critical for the earth's sustainable management
   and to slow down the global climate change by partial replacement of
   gasoline and diesel in the transport sector. Being a diverse group of
   aquatic micro-organisms, algae are the most prominent resources on the
   planet, distributed in an aquatic system, a potential source of
   bioenergy, biomass and secondary metabolites. Microalgae-based biofuel
   production is widely accepted as non-food fuel sources and better choice
   for achieving goals of incorporation of a clean fuel source into the
   transportation sector. The present review article provides a
   comprehensive literature survey as well as a novel approach on the
   application of microalgae for their simultaneous cultivation and
   bioremediation of high nutrient containing wastewater. In addition to
   that, merits and demerits of different existing conventional techniques
   for microalgae culture reactors, harvesting of algal biomass, oil
   recovery, use of different catalysts for transesterification reactions
   and other by-products recovery have been discussed and compared with the
   membrane-based system to find out the best optimal conditions for higher
   biomass as well as lipid yield. This article also deals with the use of
   a tailor-made membrane in an appropriate module that can be used in
   upstream and downstream processes during algal-based biofuels
   production. Such membrane-integrated system has the potential of
   low-cost and eco-friendly separation, purification and concentration
   enrichment of biodiesel as well as other valuable algal by-products
   which can bring the high degree of process intensification for scale-up
   at the industrial stage.

AB Genetic engineering of microalgae to accumulate high levels of
   medium-chain-length fatty acids (MCFAs) represents an attractive
   strategy to improve the quality of microalgae-based biodiesel, but it
   has thus far been least successful. We demonstrate that one limitation
   is the availability of fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) substrate
   pool for acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE). A combinational expression platform
   that involved plant lauric acid-biased TE (C12TE) and MCFA-specific
   ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KASIV) increased lauric acid (C12:0) and myristic
   acid (C14:0) accumulation by almost sevenfold and fourfold,
   respectively, compared with native strain. These findings suggest a
   platform for further investigation into the enlargement of MCFA acyl-ACP
   substrate pool as an approach to sustainably improve quality of
   microalgae-based biodiesel with regard to MCFA production.

AB Although the potential for biofuel production from microalgae via
   photosynthesis has been intensively investigated, information on the
   selection of a suitable operation strategy for microalgae-based biofuel
   production is lacking. Many published reports describe competitive
   strains and optimal culture conditions for use in biofuel production;
   however, the major impediment to further improvements is the absence of
   effective engineering strategies for microalgae cultivation and biofuel
   production. This comprehensive review discusses recent advances in
   understanding the effects of major environmental stresses and the
   characteristics of various engineering operation strategies on the
   production of biofuels (mainly biodiesel and bioethanol) using
   microalgae. The performances of microalgae-based biofuel-producing
   systems under various environmental stresses (i.e., irradiance,
   temperature, pH, nitrogen depletion, and salinity) and cultivation
   strategies (i.e., fed-batch, semi-continuous, continuous, two-stage, and
   salinity-gradient) are compared. The reasons for variations in
   performance and the underlying theories of the various production
   strategies are also critically discussed. The aim of this review is to
   provide useful information to facilitate development of innovative and
   feasible operation technologies for effectively increasing the
   commercial viability of microalgae-based biofuel production.

AB Microalgae contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle through
   photosynthesis. Given their ability to efficiently convert solar energy
   and atmospheric carbon dioxide into chemical compounds, such as
   carbohydrates, and generate oxygen during the process, microalgae
   represent an excellent and feasible carbohydrate bioresource.
   Microalgae-based biofuels are technically viable and, delineate a green
   and innovative field of opportunity for bioenergy exploitation.
   Microalgal polysaccharides are one of the most versatile groups for
   biotechnological applications and its content can be increased by
   manipulating cultivation conditions. Microalgal carbohydrates can be
   used to produce a variety of biofuels, including bioethanol, biobutanol,
   biomethane, and biohydrogen. This review provides an overview of
   microalgal carbohydrates, focusing on their use as feedstock for biofuel
   production, highlighting the carbohydrate metabolism and approaches for
   their enhancement. Moreover, biofuels produced from microalgal
   carbohydrate are showed, in addition to a new bibliometric study of

AB Biogas production from microalgae biomass via anaerobic digestion can be
   enhanced by hydrothermal pretreatment. The process of hydrothermal
   pretreatment has a significant impact on the energy gain, greenhouse gas
   emissions, and levelized cost of energy in biogas production from
   microalgae biomass, which has not been reported until now. In this
   study, life cycle and economic assessments of biogas production from
   microalgae biomass with hydrothermal pretreatment and with solar-driven
   hydrothermal pretreatment were conducted. The results showed that both
   types of pretreatment methods improved the biogas yield, promoted the
   energy gain, and reduced the levelized cost of energy. In biogas
   production through hydrothermal pretreatment, the net energy ratio
   (Energy input/Energy output), greenhouse gas emissions, and levelized
   cost of energy were 0.54, -129.94 g CO2-eq/(kWh biogas), and 0.22 $/m3,
   respectively, whereas in biogas production through solar-driven
   hydrothermal pretreatment, the corresponding values were 0.69, -166.13 g
   CO2-eq/(kWh biogas), and 0.17 $/m3, respectively. The biogas yield had
   the maximum effect on the net energy ratio and economic benefit. The
   efficiency in nitrogen recovery from the biogas residual had the maximum
   effect on greenhouse gas emissions. This work provides a theoretical
   guide to promote the environmental and economic benefits of biogas
   production from microalgae biomass.

AB Biorefineries have the potential to meet a significant part of the

   Indeed, the bio-based industry is expected to play a major role in
   energy security and climate change mitigation during the 21th century.
   Despite this, there are challenges related to resource consumption,
   processing optimization and waste minimization that still need to be
   overcome. In this context, microalgae appear as a promising non-edible
   feedstock with advantages over traditional land crops, such as high
   productivity, continuous harvesting throughout the year and minimal
   problems regarding land use. Importantly, both cultivation and
   microalgae processing can take place at the same site, which increases
   the possibilities for process integration and a reduction in logistic
   costs at biorefinery facilities. This review describes the actual

AB Biogas production via anaerobic digestion is highly attractive for
   microalgae. The technology of microalgae cultivation has profound
   impacts on biogas production system as it is the most energy-consuming
   process. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the environmental and
   economic benefits of different cultivation systems has yet to be
   sufficiently conducted. Here, life-cycle and economic assessments of
   open raceway ponds, photobioreactors and biofilm systems were
   investigated. Results showed greenhouse gas emissions of all systems
   were positive because more than two-thirds of carbon in fuel gas was
   lost and the fixed carbon in product gas and solid fertilizer was less
   than the emitted carbon during energy input. Particularly, biofilm
   system achieved the least greenhouse gas emissions (9.3 g CO2-eq/MJ),
   net energy ratio (0.7) and levelized cost of energy (0.9 $/kWh),
   indicating the optimum cultivation system. Open raceway ponds and
   photobioreactors failed to achieve positive benefits because of low
   harvesting efficiency and biomass concentration.

AB Growing algae in darkness for biodiesel production eliminates the
   challenges of evaporation and light penetration reported for open ponds
   and the costs and fouling that plague photobioreactors. The current
   study demonstrated that Chlorella kessleri str. UTEX 263 could grow
   heterotrophically in the dark on pure sugars or lignocellulosic
   hydrolysates of plant biomass. Hydrolysates of a prairie grass native to
   Kansas, Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), supported the growth of C.
   kessleri in the dark. Nitrogen limitation stimulated the accumulation of
   biodiesel lipids by 10-fold in heterotrophic cultures grown on pure
   sugars or Big Bluestem hydrolysate. Limiting P in the growth medium also
   was shown to increase cellular lipid accumulation in C. kessleri. Iron
   limitation was not sufficient to increase cellular lipid content. Crude
   biomass extracts may have levels of N that cannot be easily removed,
   which are high enough to relieve N limitations in growth media. This
   initial study suggests that P might be more easily removed from biomass
   extracts than N for increasing cellular lipid production by nutrient
   limitation and further that native prairie grasses are potentially
   suitable as sources of lignocellulosic sugars.

   cultures were prepared: Full medium, P-limited medium, N-limited medium
   and N- and P-limited medium, while another full medium was also prepared
   using 50% harvest water. The results showed that the specific growth
   rate and biomass productivity ranged from 0.289 to 0.403 day-1 and 86.30
   to 266.66 mg L-1 day-1, respectively. Nutrient-limited cultures
   witnessed much higher lipid content (41.21-46.21% of dry weight) than
   nutrient-full cultures (26% of dry weight). The N- and P-limited medium
   observed the highest FAME yield at 10.95% of dry weight, while the
   N-limited culture and P-limited culture shared the highest biodiesel
   productivity at 20.66 and 19.91 mg L-1 day-1, respectively. The
   experiment on harvest water recycling times demonstrated that 100% of
   the harvest water could be recycled twice with the addition of
   sufficient nutrients.

AB The study synergistically optimized nitrogen and phosphorous
   concentrations for attainment of maximum lipid productivity in Chlorella
   minutissima. Nitrogen and phosphorous limited cells (NLPL) showed
   maximum lipid productivity (49.10.41 mg/L/d), 1.47 folds higher than
   control. Nitrogen depletion resulted in reduced cell size with large
   sized lipid droplets encompassing most of the intracellular space while
   discrete lipid bodies were observed under nitrogen sufficiency.
   Synergistic N/P starvations showed more prominent effect on
   photosynthetic pigments as to individual deprivations. Phosphorous
   deficiency along with N starvation exhibited 17.12% decline in
   carbohydrate while no change in nitrogen sufficient cells were recorded.
   The optimum NLPL concentration showed balance between biomass and lipid
   by maintaining intermediate cell size, pigments, carbohydrate and
   proteins. FAME profile showed C14-C18 carbon chains in NLPL cells with
   biodiesel properties comparable to plant oil methyl esters. Hence,
   synergistic N/P limitation was effective for enhancing lipid
   productivity with reduced consumption of nutrients.

   quality: a review.
SO Livestock Science
VL 205

PY 2017
U1 26
U2 468
AB Microalgae, small-sized algae, have been studied as a natural marine
   resource for a number of economically relevant applications, including
   animal feed. In this review, we unveil the dietary microalgae effects
   currently known on production and meat quality of livestock species
   (ruminants, pigs, poultry and rabbits). Microalgae are classified into
   diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), green algae (Chlorophyceae), golden algae
   (Chrysophyceae) and blue-green algae cyanobacteria (Cyanophyceae). The
   most important phototrophic species belong
   toArthrospira,Chlorella,DunaliellaandHaematocussusgenus. In addition,
   heterotrophic marine organisms, such
   asCrypthecodinium,SchizochytriumandUlkenia, have been successfully
   cultivated forn-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA)
   production. Microalgae are mainly composed by proteins, carbohydrates,
   lipids, vitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds, such as carotenoids.
   This variable nutrient composition depends on species, strain and algae
   growing conditions. Research evidence so far has shown that the
   inclusion of microalgae in animal diets could improve growth and meat
   quality in ruminants, pigs, poultry and rabbits. These findings are
   highly dependent on microalgae own composition and their amount in the
   diet. In a general overview, the inclusion ofArthrospira platensisin pig
   and poultry diets increases average daily gain but negatively affects
   feed conversion ratio. RegardingSchizochytriumsp., this microalga
   improves fatty acid composition in pork and poultry meat, essentially
   due to its high content in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).Chlorella, at very
   low percentages in feed, benefits growth performance parameters of
   poultry. The use of microalgae as feed ingredients is very promising as
   an alternative to corn and soybean, thus mitigating the current
   competition among food-feed-biofuel industries. In addition, microalgae
   contribute for the protection of environment and natural resources,
   namely land degradation and water deprivation. Microalgae also provide a
   sustainable alternative forn-3 LCPUFA availability, thus protecting
   worldwide fatty fish stocks. However, the cost-effective production and
   use of microalgae is a major challenge in the near future. In fact, the
   current microalgae cultivation technology should be improved to reduce
   their production costs. In addition, we foresee that the efficiency of
   microalgae incorporation in monogastric diets could be largely improved
   by the use of Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes). CAZymes will allow
   the increase of nutrients bioavailability, as a consequence of
   recalcitrant microalgae cell walls degradation. Overall, the inclusion
   of microalgae in feed represents a very promising strategy for the
   maintenance and development of livestock sector, as an environmental
   friendly alternative to balance food-feed-biofuel industries.

AB Lipids extracted from microalgae have been considered as a potential
   source for the production of biodiesel. Enhancement of lipid has the
   limitations of low biomass productivity. So, the main objective of the
   present study was to deduce suitable conditions for the improvement of
   biomass production followed by enhancement of lipid content. After
   optimization, a strategy for two stage cultivation was utilized where
   high lipid content was obtained with a high biomass concentration.
   Optimization of biomass production of Chlorella minutissima MCC 5 was
   carried out under different intensities of light, temperatures,
   concentrations of nitrate and phosphate using Taguchi model. A suitable
   synergy of the four parameters yielded maximum biomass (1.93 g L-1) in
   airlift reactor. Temperature was found to be relatively effective than
   other parameters for higher biomass production. Activation energy for
   the cell growth was determined (47.95 kJ mol-1). Among the various
   (photo, thermal, nitrate and phosphate) stress conditions studied,
   nitrate limitation (1 mM) was found to be suitable for the enhancement
   of lipid resulting highest yield (48.26% w/w). Two stage cultivation of
   the microalgae yielded a maximum lipid content of 46% w/w with a biomass
   concentration of 2.2 g L-1. Additionally, FAME analysis exhibited
   significant increase of oleic acid in the biodiesel. So, C. minutissima
   MCC 5 cultivated under nitrate stress could be a possible feedstock for
   biodiesel production.

AB New biomass sources for alternative fuels has become a subject of
   increasing importance as the nation strives to resolve the economic and
   strategic impacts of limited fossil fuel resources on our national
   security, environment, and global climate. Algae are among the most
   promising non-food-crop-based biomass feedstocks. However, there are
   currently no commercially viable microalgae-based production systems for
   biofuel production that have been developed, as limitations include
   less-than optimal oil content, growth rates, and cultivation techniques.
   While batch studies are critical for determining basic growth phases and
   characteristics of the algal species, steady-state studies are necessary
   to better understand and measure the specific growth parameters. This
   study evaluated the effects of dilution rate on microalgal biomass
   productivity, lipid content, and fatty acid profile under steady-state
   conditions with continuous illumination and carbon dioxide supplemention
   for two types of algae. Continuous cultures were conducted for more that
   3 months. Our results show that the productivity ofChlorella
   minutissimavaried from 39 to 137 mg/L/day (dry mass) when the dilution
   rate varied from 0.08 to 0.64 day-1. The biomass productivity ofC.
   minutissimareached a maximum value (137 mg/L/day) at a dilution rate of
   0.33 day-1, while the productivity ofDunaliella tertiolectavaried from
   46 to 91 mg/L/day at a dilution rate of 0.17 to 0.74 day-1. The biomass
   productivity ofD. tertiolectareached a maximum value of 91 mg/L/day at a
   dilution rate of 0.42 day-1. Moreover, the lipid content had no
   significant change with various dilution rates.

AB This study attempted at maximizing biomass and lipid accumulation in
   Chlorella vulgaris by supplementation of natural abscisic acid (ABA) or
   synthetic 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 1-naphthaleneacetic
   acid (NAA) hormone analogs. Amongst three tested additives,
   NAA-treatment performed remarkable promoting effect on cell growth and
   lipid biosynthesis. The favorable lipid productivity (418.6 mg/L/d) of
   NAA-treated cells showed 1.48 and 2.24 times more than that of 2,4-D and
   ABA. NAA-treatment also positively modified the proportions of saturated
   (C16:0 and C18:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids (C18:1) which were
   prone to high-quality biofuels-making. Further, NAA-treatment
   manipulated endogenous phytohormones metabolism leading to the elevated
   levels of indole-3-acetic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid and
   such hormone accumulation might be indispensable for signal transduction
   in regulating cell growth and lipid biosynthesis in microalgae. In
   addition, the economic-feasibility and eco-friendly estimation of NAA
   additive indicated the higher possibilities in developing affordable and
   scalable microalgal lipids for biofuels.

AB In response to the energy crisis, global warming and climate changes,
   microalgae have received increasingly global attention as a renewable,
   alternative and sustainable source for the production of biodiesel. Much
   original research regarding microalgal biodiesel production has been
   reported. However, microalgal biodiesel faces plenty of challenges that
   current cultivation and biodiesel conversion is economically unfeasible
   for industrial applications on a large scale. This perspective paper
   first briefly discusses the latest advances in liquid transportation
   biodiesel production from microalgal biomass, including microalgal
   growth, biomass harvesting and drying, lipid extraction and biodiesel
   conversion. Subsequently, strategies for the future development of
   microalgal biodiesel have been proposed and discussed, in an attempt to
   reduce the cost gap. From the microalgal biodiesel production chain
   perspective, genetic and metabolic engineering, isolation of suitable
   species, high-efficiency bioreactor development, efficient culturing
   system development, optimal harvest process design, high-efficiency
   lipid extraction and transesterification method development will have
   critical roles to play. It is worthy of note that the increase of the
   outcome credits can also realize the reduction of the economic gap, and
   the main measures include appropriate glycerol recovery and
   reutilization, integration with wastewater treatment and CO2 mitigation
   together with microalgal biorefinery for the production of multiple
   co-products with high values. Finally, concluding remarks are put
   forward.

AB Microalgae harvesting includes conventional methods like centrifugation,
   sedimentation, and filtration, as well as advanced methods like
   flocculation, magnetic nanoparticle, and flotation. Biomass recovery
   using centrifugation is high but high gravitational force can alter the
   cell structure. Sedimentation is one of the most useful methods in
   wastewater microalgae harvesting, though it is applicable to large-cell
   microalgae (>70 mum). Filtration is a low-cost method and easy to
   process; however, fouling and clogging can result in low yield. Among
   several techniques, flocculation is one of the most effective and
   economical approaches for biomass harvesting. Nanomaterial-based
   flocculants are considered due to their efficiency and reusability.
   Nanoparticle-based flocculants have gained attention in recent years due
   to their unique properties, such as high surface area, small size, and
   enhanced reactivity. These nanoparticles can be engineered to interact
   with microalgal cells, causing agglomeration and facilitating the
   separation of biomass from the culture medium. Studies have demonstrated
   that using nanoparticle-based flocculants can significantly improve the
   efficiency of microalgae harvesting compared to traditional flocculation
   methods. This review emphasizes the mechanism of flocculation, types of
   flocculation, the dosages of flocculants, and the flocculation recovery
   efficiencies. The role of green routes in synthesizing nanoparticles for
   the advancement of flocculation technique is especially highlighted in
   this article for the sustainable biodiesel production from microalgae.
   Thorough evaluations, encompassing techno-economic and life cycle
   assessments, play a crucial role in appraising the economic feasibility
   and environmental ramifications of biofuels derived from microalgae.
   This article provides an overview of flocculation methods suitable for
   microalgal harvesting, their mechanisms, advantages, and drawbacks.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the potential lipid accumulation of an
   oleaginous Chlorella protothecoides by combination cultivation mode of
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Under co-deficiency of N and P, the
   largest lipid content (55.8%) was accomplished in C. protothecoides,
   which was higher than either sole P-deficiency (32.77%) or N-deficiency
   (52.5%), or co-repletion of N and P (control) (22.17%). However, the
   highest lipid productivity (224.14 mg/L/day) with combination mode of
   N-deficiency and P-repletion represented 1.19-3.70-fold more than that
   of control, P-deficiency/limitation, and co-deficiency of N and P,
   respectively. This indicating N-deficiency plus P-repletion was a
   promising lipid trigger to motivate lipid accumulation in C.
   protothecoides cells. Further, difference gel electrophoresis
   (DIGE)-based proteomics was employed to reveal the molecular pathways
   associated with lipid biosynthesis. These results provide the foundation
   to develop engineering strategies targeting lipid productivity for
   industrial production of microalgae-based biodiesel.

AB A new co-cultivation technology is presented that converts greenhouse
   gasses, CH4 and CO2, into microbial biomass. The methanotrophic
   bacterium, Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20z, was coupled to a
   cyanobacterium, Synechococcus PCC 7002 via oxygenic photosynthesis. The
   system exhibited robust growth on diverse gas mixtures ranging from
   biogas to those representative of a natural gas feedstock. A continuous
   processes was developed on a synthetic natural gas feed that achieved
   steady-state by imposing coupled light and O2 limitations on the
   cyanobacterium and methanotroph, respectively. Continuous co-cultivation
   resulted in an O2 depleted reactor and does not require CH4/O2 mixtures
   to be fed into the system, thereby enhancing process safety
   considerations over traditional methanotroph mono-culture platforms.
   This co-culture technology is scalable with respect to its ability to
   utilize different gas streams and its biological components constructed
   from model bacteria that can be metabolically customized to produce a
   range of biofuels and bioproducts.

AB Biodiesel from higher plants has a number of limitations like burden on

   for the cultivation of microalgae and potential yields from many green
   algae have been reported to be many folds to that obtained from the oil
   crops. Productivity in natural habitats is generally limited by low
   nitrogen and phosphorus content. Present study deals with the
   application of main nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus stress conditions
   commonly found in natural water bodies on stimulating the biofuel
   components oils inChlorella vulgaris, a unicellular freshwater green
   alga and a potential feedstock for biodiesel. Oils from the algal
   biomass were extracted in chloroform-methanol (2:1) and identified by
   GC-MS. Significantly reduced concentrations of the nutrients Ca(NO3)2and
   K2HPO4from the control values of Chu-10 medium positively affected the
   oil content without much affecting the growth. There was also a
   significant effect on the relative ratios of various types of oils
   produced by the algal strain in response to the nutrient stress
   conditions. Mostly C14to C26fatty acids were identified, with palmitic,
   oleic and stearic acids being the major ones. The relative proportion of
   the desirable biofuel component, palmitic acid, was increased
   significantly under NO3-and PO43-stress conditions. These findings
   suggest that monitoring the concentrations of a few nutrients may lead
   to significant enhancement in quantity as well as the desirable biofuel
   components with substantial growth for commercial cultivation ofC.

AB The increasing demand for sustainable, economical, and environmentally
   friendly solutions has positioned microalgae as promising candidates in
   biotechnology, particularly in food, feed, nutraceutical,
   pharmaceutical, biofuel, and bioremediation applications. This review
   explores the role of the Nannochloropsis genus and other marine
   oleaginous microalgae in co-cultivation systems, highlighting their
   mechanisms of interaction with various microorganisms and their
   potential for various biotechnological purposes. Case studies of
   Nannochloropsis sp. co-cultures with other microalgae, bacteria, and
   fungi are presented. The different types of associations are described
   as alternative strategies to enhance biomass productivity, lipid
   accumulation, and nutrient recycling. A key focus of this review is the
   potential of Nannochloropsis microalgae co-cultivation in food, as it is
   part of the list of microalgae to be approved for consumption in the
   European Union, discussing their rich nutritional value, safety, and
   regulatory status. Additionally, the role of microalgae in the
   alternative protein sector is explored, with particular emphasis on
   their integration in cultivated meat products as nutrient suppliers and
   metabolic partners for animal cells. Despite their potential, several
   challenges, such as scale-up, contamination risk, and strain selection,
   remain key obstacles to the widespread adoption of microalgal
   biotechnology. Future research should focus on optimizing
   microalgae-based co-cultures for food applications, addressing safety
   concerns, and further investigating their integration into functional
   foods and cellular agriculture products.

   only microalgae or bacteria use, thereby improving the efficiency of
   pollutant removal and bio-product productivity. Additionally, the

   comprehensively understand the interaction mechanisms underlying their
   strong adaptability. In addition, it includes recent research in which
   MBC has been efficiently used to treat various wastewater. Moreover, the

AB One of the bottlenecks to commercialize microalgae-based biofuel
   production is harvesting of microalgae biomass from high dilute culture
   broth. Meanwhile, flocculation is identified as a low cost and promising
   technique to address this challenge. In this study, the flocculating
   potential of agricultural waste derived bio-based alkali from plantain
   peel ash was evaluated. The plantain peel ash and the produced bio-based
   alkali were characterized using inductively couple plasma mass
   spectrometry (ICP-MS) and scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Results showed that more than 90%
   harvesting efficiency of microalgae biomass were obtained for both
   Nannochloropsis oculata and Dunaliella salina at 1, 2 and 3% v/v
   flocculant (bio-based alkali) dose, while the maximum biomass
   concentration factors were 20 and 14 at 1% v/v flocculant dose for N.
   oculata and D. salina respectively. The positive effect of calcium ion
   concentration on alkaline flocculation of freshwater microalgae species
   Neochloris conjuncta was demonstrated. Also, the characterization of the
   produced bio-based alkali indicates that the concentration of K+ (61,630
   ppm) is highest, followed by Ca2+ (1,569 ppm) and Na+ (582 ppm), which
   clearly support the alkaline nature of the flocculant. The chromatogram
   obtained from SEM-EDS of the ash also corroborates the highest
   proportion of potassium in the ash sample. This study shows that the
   plantain peel-derived alkali can be used to effectively and efficiently
   harvest microalgae biomass from very dilute microalgae culture media.

AB This study proposes a novel integration of a municipal wastewater
   treatment facility (WWTF) with a cyanobacterial nutrient removal process
   for sidestream wastewater treatment. A life cycle assessment (LCA)
   approach was used to determine the effectiveness and environmental
   performances of the integrated system. The LCA is populated by models of
   wastewater process engineering, material balance, cyanobacterial growth,
   and kinetics of anaerobic digestion. The cyanobacteria growth model
   incorporates chlorophyll synthesis, nitrogen uptake, photosynthesis,
   centrate inhibition, and competition for nitrogen between cyanobacteria
   and nitrifiers. Modeling results are validated against experiments with
   Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 grown in sludge centrate. With a maximum
   specific growth rate of 1.09 day-1, the nitrogen removal rate of the
   proposed WWTF would be increased by 15% when compared to the baseline
   wastewater treatment facility with a biological nutrient removal
   process. Incorporating the cyanobacterial nutrient removal process as
   the sidestream wastewater treatment of a conventional activated sludge
   process reduces the total nitrogen concentrations discharged from the
   WWTF from 25.9 to 15.2 mg 1-1. Methane yield was found to be increased
   by 4% of the baseline value when cyanobacterial biomass was co-digested
   with the activated sludge. Life cycle energy use and greenhouse gas
   emissions were found to be reduced by 8% and 17%, respectively, relative
   to a baseline wastewater treatment facility. Overall, a
   cyanobacteria-based sidestream municipal wastewater treatment process
   could be an effective and environmentally sustainable biological
   nutrient removal process in the future addressing the water-energy-food
   nexus.

AB Inoculum size strongly affects cell growth and lipid accumulation of
   microalgae, one of the most potential biodiesel feedstock, however, the
   metabolic mechanism(s) of the lipid biosynthesis upon inoculum size has
   not been fully explored yet. The effects of inoculum size on cell
   growth, lipid accumulation, and metabolic changes of a green microalga
   Chlorella sorokiniana were investigated. In our experimental range of
   inoculum size, the productivity and the cetane number (CN) of fatty acid
   methyl esters (FAME) increased with increasing initial cell density, and
   the inoculum of 1*107 cells mL-1 processed much higher productivity (up
   to 2.02-fold) and CN (up to 1.19-fold) of the FAME than the others. A
   significant correlation between the metabolic profile and quantity and
   quality of lipid production was revealed by partial least-squares to
   latent structures (PLS) analysis, and 15 key metabolites were
   identified. Most of those metabolites were involved in the
   photosynthetically fixed carbon metabolism. Furthermore, light intensity
   as one of the vital limitation factors for the high inoculum size
   cultivation was evaluated by illumination assay and the results revealed
   that increasing light intensity could improve the polyunsaturated fatty
   acids composition and lipid accumulation of C. sorokiniana. The lipid
   productivity of the culture was improved by 71.21% with the light
   intensity of 110 mol m-2 s-1, compared to that under the irradiance of
   65 mol m-2 s-1.

AB Magnetic separation, a promising bioseparation technology, is confronted
   with the challenges in recovery and recycle of magnetic matters during
   algae harvesting for biofuel extraction. The thermodynamic method was
   used to characterize the surface interactions between MNPs and algae
   cells. Three methods were adopted to detach magnetic nanoparticles-algae
   (Microcystis aeruginosa,Synechocystissp.,Nannochloropsis
   maritimaandStigeocloniumsp.) and recover magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)
   in this study. The thermodynamic method indicated that the greatest
   adhesion strength was expected forStigeocloniumsp. on MNPs. High
   detachment efficiency of MNP-algae was achieved by
   ultrasonic-extracting, which got above 90% after 5 recycles. Moreover,
   the harvesting efficiencies of these four algae cells could remain more
   than 90% after 5 recycles using a mixture of the regenerated and the raw
   MNPs.

AB This work addresses an unprecedented way of co-producing biodiesel
   (FAEE) and valuable chemicals of ethyl levulinate (EL), ethyl formate
   (EF) and diethyl ether (DEE) from wet in situ transesterification of
   microalgae. EL, EF, and DEE were significantly produced up to 23.1%,
   10.3%, and 52.1% of the maximum FAEE mass with the FAEE yield higher
   than 90% at 125°C. Experiments to elucidate a detailed route of EL and
   EF synthesis were fulfilled and it was found that its main route to the
   production of EL and EF was the acid hydrolysis of algal cells and
   esterification with ethanol. To investigate the effect of reaction
   variables on the products yields, comprehensive experiments were carried
   out with varying temperatures, solvent and alcohol volumes, moisture
   contents and catalyst amounts. Coproduction of DEE, EL, EF and FAEE can
   contribute to elevating the economic feasibility of microalgae-based

AB The suspended microalgal cultivation systems targeting the production of
   lipid for biodiesel is still unable to meet the commercial and economic
   feasibility due to high energy and cost inputs during the harvesting
   process. Currently, the attached microalgal cultivation systems are
   known as an innovative technology to resolve the problematic aspects of
   suspended cultivation as the biomass can be easily separated from the
   culture medium with negligible energy input and no chemical need.
   Accordingly, this paper is focusing on reviewing various support
   materials utilized by researchers in growing the attached microalgal
   biomass in either fixed bed or fluidized bed bioreactor to ensure
   sustainable biomass production prior for biodiesel. An extensive review
   of the cultivation conditions impacting the growth of attached
   microalgal biomass is conducted in determining the optimized condition
   to enhance biomass productivity. The novelty of this paper is presented
   through in-depth analyses and discussions concerning the kinetic models
   and mechanisms study in selecting the suitable support materials for
   attached microalgal growth system. The incorporation of the cultivation
   condition parameter in predicting the growth of attached microalgae
   biomass via kinetic study is crucial in proffering new directions for
   technological developments and microalgal industry application. The
   ability of attached microalgal biomass in efficiently assimilate the
   nutrients available in the nutrient-rich wastewater for the microalgae
   growth is considered as an economical feasible approached. The suitable
   photobioreactor designs for growing the attached microalgal biomass are
   also discussed in detail in ensuring the sustainability of attached
   microalgal biomass production.

AB Background: Cyanobacteria can be metabolically engineered to convert CO2
   to fuels and chemicals such as ethylene. A major challenge in such
   efforts is to optimize carbon fixation and partition towards target
   molecules. Results: The efe gene encoding an ethylene-forming enzyme was
   introduced into a strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803
   with increased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) levels. The
   resulting engineered strain (CD-P) showed significantly increased
   ethylene production (10.53.1 g mL1 OD1day1) compared to the control
   strain (6.41.4 g mL1 OD1 day1). Interestingly, extra copies of the
   native pepc or the heterologous expression of PEPc from the
   cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7002 (Synechococcus) in the CD-P,
   increased ethylene production (19.21.3 and 18.33.3 g mL1 OD1 day1,
   respectively) when the cells were treated with the acetyl-CoA
   carboxylase inhibitor, cycloxydim. A heterologous expression of
   phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PPSA) from Synechococcus in the CD-P also
   increased ethylene production (16.774.48 g mL1 OD1 day1) showing
   differences in the regulation of the native and the PPSA from
   Synechococcus in Synechocystis. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that
   genetic rewiring of cyanobacterial central carbon metabolism can enhance
   carbon supply to the TCA cycle and thereby further increase ethylene
   production.

AB Alteration of lipid biosynthesis is one of important biochemical changes
   when oleaginous microalgae grow under varied environmental conditions.
   The effects of culture age and nutrient limitation on triacylglycerol
   (TAG) accumulation and fatty acid content were investigated in four
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich marine microalgae. The amounts of TAGs
   in Chaetoceros sp., Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Nannochloropsis
   oculata increased sharply from day 4 to day 11, and then the former two
   remained nearly unchanged while the latter declined gradually during the
   batch culture. In contrast, no marked increase in TAG accumulation was
   observed in Pavlova viridis during the culture. Changes in total fatty
   acid (TFA) content mirrored those observed for TAG accumulation, while
   the EPA content reached a maximum generally at day 7 or 11 in the range
   of 11-32 mg g-1 dry cell weight (DCW) and then declined. Nitrogen
   limitation led to a gradual increase in the amounts of TAGs from N.
   oculata pronouncedly but almost no change in other three species. The
   TFA content of the cultures after 5 days of nitrogen limitation was
   nearly twice that after 1 day in Chaetoceros sp., P. tricornutum and P.
   viridis, while the lowest increase (220-283 mg g-1 DCW) was observed in
   N. oculata. TAGs increased gradually under phosphorus limitation in all
   four species but not sharply compared with that under nitrogen
   limitation in N. oculata. The TFA content increased gradually under
   phosphorus limitation and after 5 days of phosphorus limitation it was
   1.5-2 times that after 1 day. The EPA content was generally not
   significantly affected by nitrogen or phosphorus limitation. Culture age
   and nutrient limitation could be useful variables for optimizing TAG
   accumulation and fatty acid content with potential for biodiesel
   production.

AB Microalgae are inexhaustible feedstock for synthesis of biodiesel rich
   in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and valuable bioactive compounds.
   Their cultivation is critical in sustaining the global economy in terms
   of human consumption of food and fuel. When compared to autotrophic
   cultivation, heterotrophic systems are more suitable for producing high
   cell densities of microalgae for accumulation of large quantities of
   lipids (triacylglycerols) which can be converted into biodiesel.
   Consorted efforts are made in this communication to converge recent
   literature on heterotrophic cultivation systems with simultaneous
   wastewater treatment and algal oil production. Challenges faced during
   large scale production and limiting factors which hinder the microalgae
   growth are enumerated. A strategic deployment of integrated closed loop
   biorefinery concept with multi-product recovery is proposed to exploit
   the full potential of algal systems. Sustainable algae cultivation is
   essential to produce biofuels leading to green future.

AB Oleaginous microalgae can accumulate large amounts of storage lipids
   that have many potential applications such as in the production of
   biodiesel and health products. All of the energy for the synthesis of
   lipids in microalgae is derived from photosynthesis. To date, however,
   the quantitative relationship between photosynthesis and lipid
   accumulation rate in microalgae is still unclear. In this study,
   Nannochloropsis sp. was selected to explore this relationship by
   investigating changes in lipid accumulation, photosynthetic efficiency,
   and the electron transport chain under nutrients limitation and
   replenishment. The results of the study demonstrated that lipids were
   the main form of storage of carbon and energy for this microalga. The
   alternative electron transport chain played an important role in
   photo-protection and lipid accumulation. The photosynthetic efficiency
   of this microalga showed a strong correlation with lipid accumulation
   rate (R2 = 0.959), with higher photosynthetic efficiency translating to
   higher lipid accumulation rates during the lipid accumulation stage of
   the growth cycle. The results of the present study indicated that
   nutrient depletion might not be the best signal to understand when
   microalgae begin to accumulate oil, as it appears that photosynthetic
   efficiency also has a large role in the rate of oil accumulation.
   Additionally, the study shows that excessive light might not be needed
   in later stages of growth for lipid accumulation, which in turn would
   alleviate the damage to microalgae caused by strong light making
   large-scale cultivation more cost-effective.

AB The aim of the present work was the simultaneous treatment of urban
   wastewater using microalgae and the energetic valorization of the
   obtained biomass. Chlorella vulgaris (Cv), Scenedesmus obliquus (Sc) and
   a naturally occurring algal Consortium C (ConsC) were grown in an urban
   wastewater. The nutrient removals were quite high and the treated water
   fits the legislation (PT Dec-Lei 236/98) in what concerns the parameters
   analysed (N, P, COD). After nutrient depletion the microalgae remained
   two more weeks in the photobioreactor (PBR) under nutritional stress
   conditions, to induce sugar accumulation (22-43%). The stressed biomass
   was converted into biohydrogen (bioH2), a clean energy carrier, through
   dark fermentation by a strain of the bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes.
   The fermentation kinetics were monitored and fitted to a modified
   Gompertz model. The highest bioH2 production yield was obtained for S.
   obliquus (56.8 mL H2/gVS) which was very similar when using the same
   algae grown in synthetic media.

AB BACKGROUND: Many researchers focus on exploring approaches to improve
   lipid productivity by photosynthetic organisms. Metabolomic analysis
   provides a new way to globally explore metabolic changes. To elevate
   lipid yields in the process of biodiesel production using photosynthetic
   organisms as feedstock, metabolomics combined with orthogonal partial
   least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) is being applied widely to
   seek potential markers in regulation of lipid production. Herein,
   metabolic differences among three photosynthetic organisms Scenedesmus
   obliquus, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC7120 were
   analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). RESULTS: In total, 74 metabolites were
   identified by GC-TOF-MS. The OPLS-DA model revealed good correlation
   between metabolites and lipid content (R2=0.9916). Nine compounds
   including ethanolamine were selected as potential markers affecting
   lipid accumulation. Herein, the highest level of C18:3 revealed its
   roles in regulation of the unsaturated degree of fatty acids. Further
   study revealed that exogenous ethanolamine (2 mmol L-1) significantly
   increased the lipid content (22%) in Scenedesmus obliquus. In
   particular, ethanolamine significantly elevated the levels of C16:2,
   C18:1, and C18:2. CONCLUSION: Metabolomic analysis is a useful tool to
   search for potential markers to improve lipid accumulation of
   photosynthetic organisms. Ethanolamine can be regarded as an alternative
   compound to improve lipid content and fatty acid levels for biodiesel
   production.

AB Astaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid widely used in aquaculture and
   nutraceutical industries. Among natural sources, the
   microalgaHaematococcus pluvialisis the non-genetically modified organism
   with the greatest capacity to accumulate astaxanthin. Therefore, it is
   important to understand emerging strategies in upstream and downstream
   processing of astaxanthin from this microalga. This review covers all
   aspects regarding the production and the market of natural astaxanthin
   fromH. pluvialis. Astaxanthin biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and
   nutritional metabolisms from the green vegetative motile to red
   hematocyst stage were reviewed in detail. Also, traditional and emerging
   techniques on biomass harvesting and astaxanthin recovery were presented
   and evaluated. Moreover, the global market of astaxanthin was discussed,
   and guidelines for sustainability increasing of the production chain of
   astaxanthin fromH. pluvialiswere highlighted, based on biorefinery
   models. This review can serve as a baseline on the current knowledge
   ofH. pluvialisand encourage new researchers to enter this field of
   research.

AB Chlorella kessleri accumulates triacylglycerol usable for biodiesel-fuel
   production to >20% dry cell weight in three days when cultured in
   three-fold diluted seawater, which imposes the combinatory stress of
   hyperosmosis and nutrients limitation. The quantitative behavior of
   major C-compounds, and related-gene expression patterns were
   investigated in Chlorella cells stressed with hyperosmosis, nutrients
   limitation, or their combination, to elucidate the C-metabolism for
   economical seawater-based triacylglycerol accumulation.
   Combinatory-stress cells showed repressed protein synthesis with
   initially accumulated starch being degraded later, the C-metabolic flow
   thereby being diverted to fatty acid and subsequent triacylglycerol
   accumulation. This C-flow diversion was induced by cooperative actions
   of nutrients-limitation and hyperosmosis. Semi-quantitative PCR analysis
   implied positive rewiring of the diverted C-flow into triacylglycerol in
   combinatory-stress cells through upregulation of gene expression
   concerning fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis, and starch
   synthesis and degradation. The information of regulatory C-metabolism
   will help reinforce the seawater-based triacylglycerol accumulation
   ability in algae including Chlorella.

AB Carbohydrates are a desirable biomass compound for the generation of
   several biofuels. Phosphorus nutrient limitation causes a significant
   increase in the carbohydrate content of the cyanobacterium Arthrospira
   (Spirulina) platensis. Carbohydrates accumulated up to a content of
   63.093.43% (SD) in both batch and semi-continuous cultures. In order the
   production of carbohydrate-rich biomass through nutrient limitation to
   be maximized, it is suggested that the limited nutrients have to be
   supplied in amounts that they on one hand can support the biomass
   production while on the other hand they alter the composition of the
   biomass. In this study, phosphorus of 1.820.16 mg g-1 of dry biomass was
   the optimized amount for the maximization of carbohydrates production by
   A. platensis. Regarding the need to decrease the application amounts of
   nutrients for biomass production, this study demonstrates that the
   phosphorus supply could be decreased an order of magnitude with no
   significant decrease in biomass production. In addition, it was observed
   that biomass rich in carbohydrates bio-flocculates, during settling
   without the addition of any flocculation agent or any other
   intervention. The bio-flocculation efficiency appears to be related with
   the carbohydrate content of the biomass. In maximum carbohydrate content
   (60%), the biomass bio-flocculated at 68.497.73% the first 15 min and
   reached 80.255.58% 60 min after settling. The produced carbohydrates
   might be used as feedstock for biofuel generation, while the
   bio-flocculation and the overall settling characteristics of the
   carbohydrate-rich biomass could make its harvesting process much easier.

U2 16
AB Albeit the biodiesel production from suspended microalgal system has
   gained immense interests in recent years, the domineering limitation of
   being economically infeasible has hindered this technology from
   partaking into a large-scale operation. To curtail this issue, attached
   growth system had been introduced by various studies; however, those
   were still unable to alleviate the socio-economic challenges faced in
   commercializing the microalgal biomass production. Thus, this study had
   developed a novel approach in cultivating-cum-harvesting
   attachedChlorella vulgarissp. microalgae, whilst using solid organic
   waste of palm kernel expeller (PKE) as the supporting and alimentation
   material for microalgal biofilm formation. The effects of three
   variables, namely, PKE dosage, light intensity, and photoperiod, were
   initially modelled and later optimized using Response Surface
   Methodology tool. The derived statistical models could predict the
   growth performances of attached microalgal biomass and lipid
   productivity. The optimum growing condition was attained at PKE dosage
   of 5.67 g/L, light intensity of 197 mumol/m2s and photoperiod of 8 light
   and 16 dark hours/cycle, achieving the microalgal density and lipid
   content of 9.87  0.05 g/g and 3.39  0.28 g/g, respectively, with lipid
   productivity of 29.6 mg/L day. This optimum condition had led to the
   intensification of biodiesel quality with a high percentage of
   monounsaturated fatty acid, i.e., oleic acid (C18:1), encompassing
   81.86% of total fatty acid methyl ester components. Given that the
   positive acquisition of PKE as an excellent supporting material in
   enhancing the microalgal density and lipid productivity that had
   resulted in the commercially viable biodiesel quality, this study served
   as a novel revolution in augmenting the microalgae and solid waste
   utilities for sustainable energy generation.

AB The intensive search of new and cleaner energy catches interest in
   recent years due to huge consumption of fossil fuels coupled with the
   challenge of energy and environmental sustainability. Production of
   renewable and environmentally benign energy from locally available raw
   materials is coming in the frontline. In this work, conversion of the
   combined biomass (cotton gin trash, cow manure, and Microalgae
   [Nannochloropsis oculata]) through batch pyrolysis has been
   investigated. The effect of temperature to the production of energy
   fuels such as bio-oil, char, and biogas have been simulated considering
   the yield and energy content as responses. Result of the investigation
   generally revealed that the proportions of the different biomass did not
   significantly affect the product yield and energy recovery. Significant
   effect of temperature is evident in the simulation result of energy
   recovery whereby maximum conversion was achieved at 400°C for char (91
   wt%), 600°C for syngas (22 wt%), and 551°C for bio-oil (48 wt%). Overall
   energy conversion efficiency of 75.5% was obtained at 589°C in which
   15.6 MJ/kg of mixed biomass will be elevated to pyrolysis products.

AB Microalgae are among the most promising of non-food based biomass fuel
   feedstock alternatives. Algal biofuels production is challenged by
   limited oil content, growth rate, and economical cultivation. To develop
   the optimum cultivation conditions for increasing biofuels feedstock
   production, the effect of light source, light intensity, photoperiod,
   and nitrogen starvation on the growth rate, cell density, and lipid
   content ofChlorella minutissimawere studied. The fatty acid content and
   composition ofChlorella minutissimawere also investigated under the
   above conditions. Fluorescent lights were more effective than red or
   white light-emitting diodes for algal growth. Increasing light intensity
   resulted in more rapid algal growth, while increasing the period of
   light also significantly increased biomass productivity. Our results
   showed that the lipid and triacylglycerol content were increased under N
   starvation conditions. Thus, a two-phase strategy with an initial
   nutrient-sufficient reactor followed by a nutrient deprivation strategy
   could likely balance the desire for rapid and high biomass generation
   (124 mg/L) with a high oil content (50%) ofChlorella minutissimato
   maximize the total amount of oil produced for biodiesel production.
   Moreover, methyl palmitate (C16:0), methyl oleate (C18:1), methyl
   linoleate (C18:2), and methyl linolenate (C18:3) are the major
   components ofChlorella minutissimaderived FAME, and choice of light
   source, intensity, and N starvation impacted the FAME composition
   ofChlorella minutissima. The optimized cultivation conditions resulted
   in higher growth rate, cell density, and oil content, makingChlorella
   minutissimaa potentially suitable organism for biodiesel feedstock
   production.

AB Using renewable microalgal biomass as active feedstocks for biofuels and
   bioproducts is explored to substitute petroleum-based fuels and
   chemicals. In the last few years, the importance of microalgae biomass
   has been realized as a renewable feedstock due to several positive
   attributes associated with it. Biorefinery via anaerobic digestion (AD)
   of microalgal biomass is a promising and sustainable method to produce
   value-added chemicals, edible products and biofuels. Microalgal biomass
   pretreatment is a significant process to enhance methane production by
   AD. Findings on the AD microbial community's variety and organization
   can give novel in turn on digester steadiness and presentation. This
   review presents a vital study of the existing facts on the AD microbial
   community and AD production. Co-digestion of microalgal biomass with
   different co-substrates was used in AD to enhance biogas production, and
   the process was economically viable with improved biodegradability.
   Microcystins, which are produced by toxic cyanobacterial blooms, create
   a severe hazard to environmental health. Anaerobic biodegradation is an
   effective method to degrade the microcystins and convert into nontoxic
   products. However, for the cost-effective conversion of biomass to
   energy and other beneficial byproducts, additional highly developed
   research is still required for large-scale AD of microalgal biomass.

AB Applying microalgae is a valuable strategy for CO2removal, wastewater
   treatment, and biofuel production leading to valuable biomass
   production. However, the major challenge of biodiesel production by
   microalgae is achieving high lipid content while maintaining high
   biomass productivity. To do so, optimizing microalgal cultivation
   conditions is necessary. A novel two-stage process for increasing lipid
   productivity employingChlorella vulgariswas introduced. The effect of
   three parameters; CO2concentration (0.04-15.00% (v/v)), aeration rate
   (50-150 mL min-1), and photobioreactor diameter (7-14 cm), on microalgae
   growth, CO2, and nutrient removal in the first cultivation stage was
   studied. The effect of disconnecting CO2aeration on the lipid content
   was then studied in the second cultivation stage. The results suggest
   that the maximum cell concentration (1.73 g L-1) is related to
   cultivation in a 10.5 cm diameter photobioreactor fed with 7.52% (v/v)
   CO2concentration and 100 mL min-1 flow rate. The CO2removal rate of the
   latter photobioreactor was 100% after 7 days. Although significantly
   affected the growth and lipid content, the studied parameters had no
   obvious effect on the nutrient removal. The highest lipid content was
   32.85 wt.% and the lipid content of microalgae increased up to 61.24
   wt.% by detaching CO2aeration, a sign of the feasibility of using the
   proposed two-stage process for commercialization of biodiesel production
   by microalgae. The lipid produced by this strategy seems promising for
   biodiesel production according to American and European standards.

   energy crises. Currently, cultivating microalgae has gained large
   momentum among researchers due to their photosynthetic rate of
   CO2fixation and its versatile nature to grow in various wastewater
   systems. In addition, various options of exploring biofuels such as
   biodiesel, bio hydrogen and bioethanol etc., has made this technology
   most promising and viable one. However, the efficiency of wastewater
   treatment differs species to species. In this review paper the use of
   microalgae groupChlorophytafor various energy and environmental
   applications have been discussed. Further, the aspects such as
   applicability ofChlorophytain industrial wastewater treatment, domestic
   wastewater treatment and nutrient removal are presented. In addition,
   the harvesting techniques, cultivation methods and other commercial

AB An emerging renewable energy source from living organisms, microalgae
   are recognized for its remarkable energy content and continuously
   receiving interest with a great potential in increasing its shares in
   fuel market. The main challenge for stable biorefinery operation is
   cultivation, given that the growth of microalgae is highly dependent on
   climate conditions, especially ambient temperature, and solar exposure.
   Herein, an advanced forecasting algorithm predicts daily climate
   conditions a year ahead. The forecast is then used in a dynamic
   metaheuristic optimization framework to determine optimal microalgae
   biorefinery process pathways with promising total annual margins and
   greenhouse gas emissions. In return, the optimal solution is reported
   with a total annual margin of 815,716 US$/y and greenhouse gas emission
   of 1.1 * 107kg CO2-eqv/y. The most feasible microalgae species among the
   selection pool are identified in terms of kinetic growth, which is
   attributed to the climate behavior of the selected case-study region. A
   scheduling scheme is then identified for the optimal harvest period of
   cultivated microalgae. Next, uncertainty analysis for the selected
   process configuration is conducted using Monte Carlo simulation to
   investigate how variations in climate conditions will affect its overall
   performance. Additionally, the process is further enhanced by including
   renewable electricity sources which allow reducing 50% greenhouse gas
   emissions with the configuration of biomass energy (1.2%), solar power
   (0.1%), and wind energy (98.7%). In summary, this study provided a
   comprehensive guidelines on strategically deploying large scale
   microalgae biorefineries considering its long-term operational
   sustainability abiding the possible uncertainties within the system
   proposed.

AB The utilization of microalgae and fungi on an industrial scale is a
   challenge for researchers. Based on the question "how fungi have
   contributed to microalgae research?," we verified the scientific trends
   on microalgae-fungi consortia focused on biofuels production by
   searching for articles on the Web of Science and Scopus databases
   through the terms "microalgae*" or phytoplankton and "fung*." We found
   1,452 articles published between 1950 and 2020; since 2006, the
   publication numbers have increased rapidly. The articles were published
   in 12 languages, but most were written in English (96.3%). Among 72
   countries, China (360 articles), USA (344), and Germany (155) led the
   publication rank. Among the 10 most-prolific authors, 8 were Chinese,
   like 5 of the most-productive institutions, whereas the National Cheng
   Kung University was on the top of the list. The sources that published
   the most on the subject were: Bioresource Technology (96), PLoS ONE
   (28), and Science of the Total Environment (26). The keyword analysis
   emphasized the magnitude of applications in microalgae-fungi consortia
   research. Confirming this research question, biofuels appeared as a
   research trend, especially biodiesel, biogas, and related terms like
   lipid, lipid accumulation, anaerobic digestion, and biogas upgrading.
   For 70 years, articles have been published, where China and the United
   States seem to dominate the research scenario, and biodiesel is the main
   biofuel derived from this consortium. However, microalgae-based biofuel
   biorefinery is still a bottleneck on an industrial scale. Recent
   environmental challenges, such as greenhouse gas mitigation, can be a
   promising field for that microalgae-fungi application.

   sustainable biofuels production.
SO Science of the Total Environment
VL 802
PY 2022
U1 46
U2 249
AB There is a growing global recognition that microalgae-based biofuel are
   environment-friendly and economically feasible options because they
   incur several advantages over traditional fossil fuels. Also, the
   microalgae can be manipulated for extraction of value-added compounds
   such as lipids (triacylglycerols), carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty
   acids, proteins, pigments, antioxidants, various antimicrobial
   compounds, etc. Recently, there is an increasing focus on the
   co-cultivation practices of microalgae with other microorganisms to
   enhance biomass and lipid productivity. In a co-cultivation strategy,
   microalgae grow symbiotically with other heterotrophic microbes such as
   bacteria, yeast, fungi, and other algae/microalgae. They exchange
   nutrients and metabolites; this helps to increase the productivity,
   therefore facilitating the commercialization of microalgal-based fuel.
   Co-cultivation also facilitates biomass harvesting and waste
   valorization, thereby help to build an algal biorefinery platform for
   bioenergy production along with multivariate high value bioproducts and
   simultaneous waste bioremediation. This article comprehensively reviews
   various microalgae cultivation practices utilizing co-culture approaches
   with other algae, fungi, bacteria, and yeast. The review mainly focuses
   on the impact of several binary culture strategies on biomass and lipid
   yield. The advantages and challenges associated with the procedure along
   with their respective cultivation modes have also been presented and
   discussed in detail.

AB The ability of microalgae to grow in nutrient-rich environments and to
   accumulate nutrients from wastewaters (WW) makes them attractive for the
   sustainable and low-cost treatment of WW. The valuable biomass produced
   can be further used for the generation of bioenergy, animal feed,
   fertilizers, and biopolymers, among others. In this study, Scenedesmus
   obliquus was able to remove nutrients from different wastewaters
   (poultry, swine and cattle breeding, brewery and dairy industries, and
   urban) with removal ranges of 95-100% for nitrogen, 63-99% for
   phosphorus and 48-70% for chemical oxygen demand. The biomass
   productivity using wastewaters was higher (except for poultry) than in
   synthetic medium (Bristol), the highest value being obtained in brewery
   wastewater (1025 mg/(L.day) of freeze-dried biomass). The produced
   biomass contained 31-53% of proteins, 12-36% of sugars and 8-23% of
   lipids, regardless of the type of wastewater. The potential of the
   produced Scenedesmus obliquus biomass for the generation of BioH2
   through batch dark fermentation processes with Enterobacter aerogenes
   was evaluated. The obtained yields ranged, in mL H2/g Volatile Solids
   (VS), from 50.1 for biomass from anaerobically digested cattle WW to 390
   for swine WW, whereas the yield with biomass cultivated in Bristol
   medium was 57.6 mL H2/gVS.

AB In the present study, the effect of cross-flow filtration (CFF) on the
   overall valorization of Chlorella spp. microalgae as biogas was
   assessed. The effect of CFF on microalgae cell integrity was quantified
   in terms of viability which was correlated with the anaerobic
   biodegradability. The viability dropped as the biomass concentration
   increased, whereas anaerobic biodegradability increased linearly with
   the viability reduction. It was hypothesized that a stress-induced
   release and further accumulation of organic polymers during CFF
   increased the flux resistance which promoted harsher shear-stress
   conditions. Furthermore, the volume reduction as the concentration
   increased entailed an increase in the specific energy supply to the
   biomass. The energy demand was positive in the whole range of
   concentrations studied, yielding an overall energy efficiency as high as
   22.9% for the highest concentration studied. Specifically, heat
   requirements were lower than electricity requirements only when the
   biomass concentrations exceeded 10 g COD.L-1.

AB Sustainable, clean, renewable energy without negotiating contiguous
   environment is a challenging task mainly comprises of natural resource
   management which involves operational efficiency, waste minimisation and
   energy recovery. Disposal of untreated industrial wastewater with
   chemical nutrients especially compounds containing nitrogen and
   phosphorous lead to eutrophication and related environmental issues that
   affect the recycling processes of bio system. Biotransformation of
   pollutants using microalgae has proven to be proficient and economic
   method of wastewater treatment due to their adaptability of growing in
   various wastewater streams and also useful in the process of CO2
   fixation. Moreover this technology has the competence of producing bio
   fuels as an alternative energy resource in the form of bio diesel, bio
   ethanol and biogas. In this review paper, the applicability of
   microalgae cultivation in industrial wastewater treatment has been
   discussed extensively including the processes involved, influencing
   operational parameters such as study mode, cultivation mode and time,
   method of aeration, pH and intensity of light. Further, the cultivation
   methods, harvesting techniques involved in the treatment process have
   been presented. In addition, the analysis on removal efficiency of algal
   treatment, biomass productivity and lipid content of the cultivated
   biomass has been discussed widely which possibly will be helpful in
   adopting the process integration in industrial wastewater treatment with
   bio energy production.

   forChlorella minutissima,Thalassiosira fluviatilisandThalassiosira
   pseudonana, strains maintained at the Instituto Oceanografico of the

   andn-hexane as solvent. The results showed a lipid content of 15.5% (%
   dry weight) forC. minutissima, 40.3% forT. fluviatilisand 39.5% forT.
   pseudonana. To determine the feasibility of using microalgae into the
   biofuel industry is essential to consider the daily biomass and oil
   productivities along with the lipid content, as could be evidenced inC.
   minutissima. The results indicate that the sonication-assisted method
   withn-hexane was efficient for lipid extraction in these strains,
   suggesting a favorable potential for biodiesel production.

AB Life cycle assessments of microalgal cultivation systems are often
   conducted to evaluate the sustainability and feasibility factors of the
   entire production chain. Unlike widely reported conventional microalgal
   cultivation systems, the present work adopted a microalgal-bacterial
   cultivation approach which was upscaled into a pilot-scale continuous
   photobioreactor for microalgal biomass production into biodiesel from
   wastewater resources. A multiple cradle-to-cradle system ranging from
   microalgal biomass-to-lipid-to-biodiesel was evaluated to provide
   insights into the energy demand of each processes making up the
   microalgae-to-biodiesel value chain system. Energy feasibility studies
   revealed positive NER values (4.95-8.38) for producing microalgal
   biomass but deficit values for microalgal-to-biodiesel (0.14-0.23),
   stemming from the high energy input requirements in the downstream
   processes for converting biomass into lipid and biodiesel accounting to
   88-90% of the cumulative energy demand. Although the energy balance for
   microalgae-to-biodiesel is in the deficits, it is comparable with other
   reported biodiesel production case studies (0.12-0.40). Nevertheless,
   the approach to using microalgal-bacterial cultivation system has
   improved the overall energy efficiency especially in the upstream
   processes compared to conventional microalgal cultivation systems.
   Energy life cycle assessments with other microalgal based biofuel
   systems also proposed effective measures in increasing the energy
   feasibility either by utilizing the residual biomass and less energy
   demanding downstream extraction processes from microalgal biomass. The
   microalgal-bacterial cultivation system is anticipated to offer both
   environmental and economic prospects for upscaling by effectively
   exploiting the low-cost nutrients from wastewaters via bioconversion
   into valuable microalgal biomass and biodiesel.

AB Chlorella vulgaris was cultivated by semi-continuous and continuous mode
   to reduce the emissions of both biogas slurry and CO2. In
   semi-continuous cultivation mode, when the renewal rate was 30%,
   nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the biogas slurry were stable at 16
   to 18 mg/L and 0.4 to 0.6 mg/L, respectively, which met the secondary
   sewage discharge regulations. While the renewal rate increased to higher
   than 40%, a dynamic equilibrium was obtained between the microalgae
   biomass and its absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus in the biogas
   slurry after three days, but the removal rates of nitrogen and
   phosphorus did not meet the direct sewage discharge standard. Effects of
   chlorella vulgaris on the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in the
   biogas slurry were investigated in a columnar photobioreactor by
   selecting the daily renewal rates at 20% and 30% in continuous mode. The
   results exhibited that the total nitrogen amount in the biogas slurry
   remained at 55.64 mg/L after 12 days on the 7 L scale. Emission
   reduction of biogas slurry employing the microalgae method was primarily
   restricted by the light limitation during the large-scale cultivation.

AB Along with the increase in global awareness of rising CO2 levels,
   microalgae have attracted considerable interest as a promising CO2
   reduction platforms since they exhibit outstanding biomass productivity
   and are capable of producing numerous valuable products. At this moment,
   however, two major barriers, relatively low photosynthetic CO2 fixation
   efficiency and necessity of carbon-intensive microalgal process,
   obstruct them to be practically utilized. This review suggests effective
   approaches to improve life-cycle CO2 reduction of microalgal
   biorefinery. In order to enhance photosynthetic CO2 fixation, strategies
   to augment carbon content and to increase biomass productivity should be
   considered. For reducing CO2 emissions associated with the process
   operations, introduction of efficient process elements, designing of
   energy-saving process routes, reuse of waste resources and utilization
   of process integration can be noteworthy options. These comprehensive
   strategies will provide guidance for microalgal biorefineries to become
   a practical CO2 reduction technology in near future.

AB Climate change could impact nutrient bioavailability in aquatic
   environment. To understand the interaction of nutrient bioavailability
   and elevated CO2,Chlorella vulgariscells were grown in ambient air or 5%
   CO2in different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in a
   photobioreactor. The chlorophyll content, photosynthesis and respiration
   rates increased in 5% CO2to support higher biomass production. The
   nutrient limitation in the growth media resulted in reduced
   photosynthetic rates of the algal cells and their PSI, PSII, and whole
   chain electron transport rates and biomass production. Conversely, their
   lipid content increased partly due to upregulation of expression of
   several lipid biosynthesis genes. The order of downregulation of
   photosynthesis and upregulation in lipid production due to nutrient
   limitation was in the order of N > P. The N-50 and 5% CO2culture had
   only 10% reduction in biomass and 32% increase in lipids having 85%
   saturated fat required for efficient biofuel production. This growth
   condition is ideal for generation of biodiesel required to reduce the
   consumption of fossil fuel and combat global warming.

AB The present study illustrates optimization and synergetic potential of

   industry wastewater (DIWW) through response surface methodology (RSM).
   Maximum lipid productivity of 34.41% was obtained under 50% DIWW
   supplemented with 0 mg L-1 nitrate (NO3-), and 50 mg L-1 phosphate
   (PO4-3). While maximum biomass productivity (1.54 g L-1) was obtained
   with 50% DIWW supplemented with 100 mg L-1 NO3-, and 50 mg L-1, PO4-3.
   Maximum removal of COD (43.47%), NO3- (99.80%) and PO4-3 (98.24%) was
   achieved with 8th run (75% DIWW, 150 mg L-1 NO3-, 75 mg L-1 PO4-3), 15th
   run (50% DIWW, 0 mg L-1 NO3-, 50 mg L-1, PO4- 3) followed by 1st run
   (25% DIWW, 50 mg L-1 NO3-, and 25 mg L-1, PO4-3), respectively. Lipid
   (bio-oil) obtained from 15th run of experiment was converted in
   biodiesel through base catalyze transesterification process. Fatty acid
   methyl ester (FAME) analysis of biodiesel confirmed the presence of
   major fatty acids in C. pyrenoidosa grown in DIWW were C11:0, C14:0,
   C16:0, C16:1, C18:1 and C18:2. Results of study clearly demonstrate
   enhanced growth and lipid accumulation by C. pyrenoidosa in surplus
   PO4-3 and limitation of NO3- sources with DIWW and its suitability as
   potential alternative for commercial utilization.

AB Advanced Biofuels steadily developed during recent year, with several
   highly innovative processes and technologies explored at various scales:
   among these, lignocellulosic ethanol and CTO (Crude Tall Oil)-biofuel
   technologies already achieved early-commercial status, while
   hydrotreating of vegetable oils is today fully commercial, with almost
   3.5 Mt/y installed capacity worldwide. In this context, microalgae grown
   in salt-water and arid areas represent a promising sustainable chain for
   advanced biofuel production but, at the same time, they also represent a
   considerable challenge. Processing microalgae in an economic way into a
   viable and sustainable liquid biofuel (a low-cost mass-product) is not
   trivial. So far, the most studied microalgae-based biofuel chain is
   composed by microorganism cultivation, lipid accumulation, oil
   extraction, co-product valorization, and algae oil conversion through
   conventional esterification into Fatty Acids Methyl Esters (FAME), i.e.
   Biodiesel, or Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), the latter
   representing a very high quality drop-in biofuel (suitable either for
   road transport or for aviation). However, extracting the algae oil at
   low cost and industrial scale is not yet a mature process, and there is
   not yet industrial production of algae-biofuel from these two
   lipid-based chains. Another option can however be considered: processing
   the algae through dedicated thermochemical reactors into advanced
   biofuels, thus approaching the downstream processing of algae in a
   completely different way than separation. The present work examines the
   possible routes for thermochemical conversion of microalgae into liquid
   biofuels, distinguishing between dry-processes (namely Pyrolysis, PO)
   and wet-processes (near critical-water HydroThermal Liquefaction, HTL).
   A literature review on algae-HTL was carried out, distinguishing between
   batch and continuous experiments, and compared to original results from
   algae pyrolysis. In particular, pyrolysis was carried out on both
   starved (lipid-accumulated) and non-starved microalgae. Typical
   composition of major products is given for both PO and HTL, comparing
   the main characteristic of the products. Major engineering advantages
   and challenges in thermochemical conversion of algae into liquid
   biofuels were identified and discussed for both processes, in view of
   the production of a transport biofuel and the full exploitation of this
   renewable feedstock in energy and biorefinery complexes.

AB Pakistan has a strong potential of biodiesel production if the available
   feedstock resources are used sustainably and implementable policies are
   made in appropriate direction. To meet the energy demands and to find
   alternative and non-conventional resources of energy different
   challenges like research and development, infrastructure development,
   decentralized type of power delivery system, commercialization, market
   development, education and outreach programs, public awareness,
   monitoring, subsidies, government participation, technology transfer and
   evaluation must be considered and a comprehensive policy must also be
   made to systematically control and integrate them at national level.
   Pakistan is enriched with a wide variety of feed stocks which can be
   used for biodiesel production. Pakistan has an enormous potential of
   biodiesel production from jatropha, plants seed oil and microalgae which
   needs more consideration and practical applications. Harvesting the
   potential of microalgae for biodiesel production in Pakistan can be
   helpful to make it self-sufficient for energy demands. Pakistan is also
   facing several challenges like climate change, lack of financial
   resources, state of art technology and absence of appropriate government
   policies, which limit the commercialization of biodiesel. Although
   Government of Pakistan has established different institutions to promote
   and develop alternative energy technologies and to achieve 10% share of
   bioenergy in the energy sector by 2020, but still the targets are to be
   achieved on practical grounds. In this article, we have reviewed the
   potential of biodiesel in Pakistan, feed stocks, biodiesel production
   process, barriers and future developments. Future policies on biofuels,
   trends, recommendations, and the implication of existing policies are
   also discussed with research and developments goals for the promotion of

AB Substantial progress has been made in algal technologies in past few
   decades. Initially, microalgae drew the attention of the scientific
   community as a renewable source of biofuels due to its high productivity
   over a short period of time and potential of significant lipid
   accumulation. As of now, a technological upsurge has elaborated its
   scope in phycoremediation of both organic and inorganic pollutants. The
   dual role of microalgae - i.e., phycoremediation coupled with energy
   production - is well established, however, commercially, algal biofuel
   production is not yet sustainable due to high energy inputs. Efforts are
   being made to make the algal biofuel economy through modification in the
   cultivation conditions, harvesting, and extraction of value added
   products. Recent studies have demonstrated algal biomass production with
   various types of wastewater and industrial effluents. Similarly, the
   recent advent of eco-friendly harvesting technologies - such as low-cost
   green coagulants, electrochemical harvesting, etc. - are energy
   efficient and economical. Contemporary improvement in efficient lipid
   extraction from biomass will make algal biodiesel economical. The
   absolute extraction of all the value added products from algal biomass,
   either whole cell or lipid extracted biomass, in a complete biorefinery
   approach will be more economical and eco-friendly.

   medium increased the total carbohydrate and starch content of microalga
   by 50.28 and 34.06%, respectively. However, this significantly lowered
   their yield due to low microalgal biomass production. Cultivation ofC.
   sorokinianacells with 4.0 g/L KNO3as nitrogen source for 8 days was
   optimum for bioethanol production as the highest total carbohydrate
   yield of 422.44 mg/L was obtained under these conditions. Nitrate
   limitation (1.0 g/L KNO3) favored the increased production of high-value
   carotenoids inC. sorokinianathat could further contribute to improving
   the economics of the bioethanol production process. Feasibility studies
   for ethanol production fromC. sorokinianarevealed that a maximum of
   13.86 mg/mL of reducing sugars was extracted in the hydrolysate by
   treating the microalgal biomass with 2.8% sulfuric acid at 121°C for 30
   min. Fermentation of acid hydrolysate produced ethanol at a
   concentration of 2.91 mg/mL in 96 h with 41.16% of theoretical yield.

AB Isochrysis galbana is a subject of study for its potential application
   across different biorefinery industries, due to its biological and
   biochemical characteristics. However, the optimization of culture
   conditions and assessment of current efforts towards the scaling from
   laboratory to small to large scale are pertinent to be addressed. The
   review aims to summarize the research related to the culture of I.
   galbana, focusing on identifying the optimal parameters that improve
   growth and lipid production. In addition, small- and large-scale
   cultures and downstream processes are explored. Optimal culture
   conditions include growth on F/2 or Walne media, use of additives (e.g.,
   fertilizer, iron), 400 mol m-2 s-1 irradiance, 18:6-h light:dark
   photoperiod, 30°C temperature, 30-35 psu salinity, 7.5-8.5 pH, and 1.5%
   CO2-enrich airflow. Meanwhile, only a few studies have cultured I.
   galbana in small- and large-scale systems. Small-scale production
   results highlight the relevance of parameter optimization, as
   productivities vary across studies. Moreover, large-scale systems
   revealed high biomass and lipid productivity. Downstream processing of
   this microalgal biomass is evaluated, and centrifugation, - 80°C
   storage, enzyme inactivation, and Folch extraction methods are the
   preferred protocols. Overall, the application of novel genetic
   modification strategies holds promises for enhancing growth and lipid
   accumulation. Isochrysis galbana represents a relevant species for
   biorefinery industries; the culture under optimized conditions and
   suitable systems could greatly enhance its viability. However,
   forthcoming research in genetically engineered strains and study of the
   intra-strain variations of this species are required to completely
   assess its biotechnological potential.

AB Excessive generation of wastewater is one of the major reasons for
   pollution in natural reservoirs. Given the normal circumstances, natural
   water bodies revive and rejuvenate themselves; but upon increased waste
   load, the self-revival system of the ecosystem slows down, causing water
   pollution. Hazardous waste, especially heavy metals and organic
   pollutants, have affected the ecology to the detriment of humans. Thus,
   the need arises for wastewater treatment, before its discharge. Current
   methods undertaken include the use of physical settling of solid waste,
   filtration, aerobic and anaerobic microbes, and chemical treatments. Low
   removal of pathogens, dependence on the uninterrupted power supply, high
   maintenance cost, generation of explosive biogas and bioaccumulation of
   chemicals are some disadvantages of activated sludge technology, one of
   the modern technologies used. Hence, the focus has been shifted on
   organisms capable of metabolizing, immobilizing or absorbing toxic
   compounds from their environment, making it both environment-friendly
   and cost-effective. This review provides perspicacity about the
   generation of sewage and the various methods available for its
   treatment. Emphasis is made on bioremediation using Spirulina platensis.
   Since the organism assimilates the bioavailable contaminants of sewage
   water photosynthetically; it can overcome the demerits of conventional
   methods. It also discusses possibilities of using Spirulina grown on the
   sewage as a food supplement, animal fodder or source of bioactive
   compounds.

AB Cell genetics, culture conditions and the recovery efficiency of cells
   and products are the bottlenecks for industrial bioprocesses from
   microalgae. Microalgae lipids can be used for different applications,
   e.g., drugs, food, and biofuels, and their purpose considers the nature
   and concentration of the lipids that are wished to obtain. For the
   biotechnological production of lipids, adequate culture conditions are
   necessary to enable the cell strain to obtain high biomass and lipid
   yields and productivities. Also, the processes of separating the cells
   from the culture medium and releasing the lipids from that biomass need
   to be efficient and economically viable. Considering that cultivation,
   cell recovery and lipid extraction directly reflect the results
   obtained, the most appropriate methods for these operations must be
   applied. Many literature reviews report the lipid and fatty acid
   contents obtained through the cultivation of different microalgae
   species and strains. However, few studies relate the contents of these
   biomolecules, either with the methods of obtaining the biomass or with
   the extraction of lipids. Even so far there is no review in the
   literature with such an approach. The aim of this work was to review and
   discuss the culture conditions for different microalgae strains and
   their influence on lipid content; the separation of microalgae biomass,
   including biomass thickening methods, and methods of biomass depletion;
   the methods of cellular disruption and lipid extraction; the influence
   on biofuels' production, e.g. biodiesel, bioalcohols and biohydrogen;
   and the influence of green chemistry (solvents and extraction
   technologies) for a sustainable production of biofuels under the concept
   of biorefinery.

AB The techno-environmental performance of a medium-scale wastewater
   treatment system using high-rate algal ponds was evaluated through mass
   and energy balances and life cycle assessment. The system involves
   wastewater primary treatment, microalgae-based secondary treatment,
   thermal hydrolysis with steam explosion of microalgae, anaerobic
   co-digestion of pre-treated microalgal biomass and primary sludge, and
   biogas cogeneration. Furthermore, two scenarios based on alternative
   biogas uses were considered: (i) biogas for heat and electricity, and
   (ii) biogas for heat, electricity, and biomethane. Pumping wastewater to
   the primary settler arose as the main source of electricity consumption.
   When compared to conventional activated sludge plants, a large decrease
   in the energy consumption was observed for the secondary treatment.
   Moreover, a favourable life-cycle performance was generally found for
   the microalgae-based systems when displacing conventional energy
   products. Finally, the preference for a specific scenario on biogas use
   was found to be highly conditioned by the techno-environmental aspects
   prioritised by decision-makers.

AB The key challenges in lipid production from marine microalgae include
   the selection of appropriate strain, optimization of the culture
   conditions and enhancement of biolipid yield. This study is aimed at
   evaluating the optimal harvest time and effect of chlorella growth
   factor (CGF) extract, carbon sources and phytohormones on the biomass
   and lipid production inChlorella vulgaris. CGF, extracted using hot
   water fromChlorellahas been reported to possess various medicinal
   properties. However, in the present study, for the first time inC.
   vulgaris, CGF was found as a best growth stimulator by enhancing the
   biomass level (1.208 kg m-3) significantly on day 5. Gibberellin and
   citrate augmented the biomass by 0.935 kg m-3and 1.025 kg m-3.
   Combination of CGF and phytohormones were more effective than CGF and
   carbon sources. Analysis of fatty acid methyl esters indicated that the
   ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids is higher in cytokinin,
   abscisic acid and CGF, and are also rich in short chain carbon atoms,
   ideal criteria for biodiesel. Nitrogen starvation favoured synthesis of
   more unsaturated fatty acids than saturated. This study shows that CGF
   enhances the biomass and lipid significantly and thus can be used for
   large scale biomass production.

   interests in algae-based energy have been increasing in the last decade,
   only a small percentage of the bewildering diversity exhibited by
   microalgae has been investigated for biodiesel production. In this work,
   seven strains of green microalgae belonging to the
   generaScenedesmus,TetradesmusandDesmodesmuswere grown in liquid medium
   with or without a nitrogen (N) source-at two different irradiances (120 
   20 and 200  20 mumol photons m-2s-1)-to evaluate biomass production and
   FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) content for biodiesel production. The
   strains ofTetradesmus obliquusandDesmodesmus abundansgrown in N-deprived
   medium showed the highest FAME content (22.0% and 34.6%, respectively);
   lipid profile characterization highlighted the abundance of saturated
   FAME (as C16:0 and C18:0) that favors better viscosity (flow properties)
   and applicability of biodiesel at low temperatures. Light microscopy and
   confocal laser scanning microscopy observations were employed as a fast
   method to monitor the vital status of cells and lipid droplet
   accumulation after Nile red staining in different culture conditions.

AB Biogas produced by anaerobic digestion is typically converted into
   electricity and low value heat. In this study, biogas is microbially
   transformed into valuable bioproducts. As proof of principle, the
   production of feed additives, i.e. lipids and polyhydroxybutyrate, out
   of biogas was evaluated. In a first stage, the CO2in a synthetic biogas
   was photosynthetically fixed by an algaeScenedesmussp. culture at an
   average rate of 1929 mg CO2L-1liquid d-1, resulting in concomitant
   O2production. After N-depletion, more than 30% of the 2207 mg lipids
   g-1total organic carbon were unsaturated. In a second stage, the
   theoretical resulting gas mixture of 60% CH4and 40% O2was treated by a
   methane oxidizingMethylocystis parvusculture, with oxidation rates up to
   4527 mg-1CH4-C L-1liquid d-1. By repeated N-limitation, concentrations
   of 29550 mg intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate g-1cell dry weight were
   achieved. Finally, a one-stage approach with controlled coculturing of
   both microbial groups resulted in harvestable bioflocs. This is the
   first time that a total microbial conversion of both greenhouse gases
   into biomass was achieved without external O2provision. Based on these
   results, a biotechnological approach is discussed whereby all kinds of
   biogas can be transformed into valuable bioproducts.

AB Haematococcus pluvialisandChromochloris zofingiensisare freshwater
   microalgae exploited to produce the high-value carotenoid, astaxanthin.
   Nonetheless, a copious amount of freshwater is consumed for microalgae
   cultivation, thereby raising concerns regarding sustainable astaxanthin
   production. Characterization of palm oil mill effluent (POME) obtained
   from a commercial facility in southern Sri Lanka revealed high
   concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP) and low
   concentrations of heavy metals, thus showcasing the potential of POME as
   an alternative growth media for astaxanthin production. Hence,H.
   pluvialisandC. zofingiensiswere cultivated in 2.5%, 5.0% and 7.5% POME
   with the aim of producing astaxanthin, reducing freshwater consumption,
   and simultaneous phycoremediation.H. pluvialisexhibited better
   adaptability to higher POME concentrations, with its maximum astaxanthin
   yield (22.43 mg/L) achieved in 7.5% POME, whilst reducing specific
   freshwater consumption for astaxanthin production by 43%. However, only
   moderate performance in phycoremediation was achieved, with removal of
   50.9% chemical oxygen demand (COD), 49.3% total nitrogen and 69.4% total
   phosphorous at rates of 3.95 mg/L/d, 0.50 mg/L/d and 0.11 mg/L/d
   respectively. The heavy metal content in biomass was within permissible
   limits. Characterization of astaxanthin-extracted residual biomass ofH.
   pluvialisrevealed possible applications as protein-rich animal feed or
   feedstock for biofuel production. Results indicated that POME generated
   in Sri Lankan palm oil mills has the potential to be utilized for large
   scale production of microalgal astaxanthin. Nevertheless, pilot-scale
   experiments, product toxicology evaluation and techno-economic
   feasibility studies are required prior to implementation of large-scale
   POME-integrated astaxanthin production facilities.

   resource to rely on for better future. A worldwide attention is drawn
   towards the algal species for their high nutritional profile,
   therapeutic properties due to which they are being used as food, feed,
   fuel, fertilizers, colourant, antioxidants, a resource of toxins and
   bioactive compounds. Not also these properties but also some special
   properties that makes alga a much more reliable resource in its role in
   environment as bioindicators, bioremediation tool and global warming

AB Microalgal likeChlorella vulgaris, being a unicellular green algae, is
   been widely studied for nitrogen and phosphorus removal and as potential
   feedstock for biodiesel production. This not only saves water from
   eutrophication but also becomes a good source of biodiesel. Hence, if
   two approaches are combined we can overcome the major challenge of both
   eutrophication and energy crisis. In the present study we have examined
   the effect of decreasing Nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in medium
   on growth, biomass and lipid content ofC. vulgaris. Significant decrease
   in growth and biomass was observed with the decrease of nitrogen and
   phosphorus concentration in the medium from (1.5 g/l to 0.0 g/l) and
   (0.04 g/l to 0.0 g/l) respectively. Whereas the lipid accumulation
   showed reverse trend of increase when the concentration of both
   phosphorus and nitrogen where decreased in medium. At the same time, the
   effect of variation in pH and saline ranges on growth, biomass and lipid
   content ofC. vulgariswere also evaluated. The growth, biomass and lipid
   content showed a significant difference due to the variation in pH and
   saline range. The growth and lipid content was maximum at control range
   i.e pH 7 with respect to 6, 8 and 9. On the other hand we could see that
   with the increase of salinity from 0.1 M to 0.25 M the growth decreased
   whereas the lipid content showed an increasing trend.

AB Algal biofuel production has gained a renewed interest in recent years
   but is still not economically feasible due to several limitations
   related to algal culture. The objective of this study is to explore a
   novel attached culture system for growing the alga Chlorella sp. as
   biodiesel feedstock, with dairy manure wastewater being used as growth
   medium. Among supporting materials tested for algal attachment,
   polystyrene foam led to a firm attachment, high biomass yield (25.65
   g/m2, dry basis), and high fatty acid yield (2.31 g/m2). The biomass
   attached on the supporting material surface was harvested by scraping;
   the residual colonies left on the surface served as inoculum for
   regrowth. The algae regrowth on the colony-established surface resulted
   in a higher biomass yield than that from the initial growth on fresh
   surface due to the downtime saved for initial algal attachment. The
   10-day regrowth culture resulted in a high biodiesel production
   potential with a fatty acid methyl esters yield of 2.59 g/m2 and a
   productivity of 0.26 g/m-2 day-1. The attached algal culture also
   removed 61-79% total nitrogen and 62-93% total phosphorus from dairy
   manure wastewater, depending on different culture conditions. The
   biomass harvested from the attached growth system (through scraping) had
   a water content of 93.75%, similar to that harvested from suspended
   culture system (through centrifugation). Collectively, the attached
   algal culture system with polystyrene foam as a supporting material
   demonstrated a good performance in terms of biomass yield, biodiesel
   production potential, ease to harvest biomass, and physical robustness
   for reuse.

AB The increasing world population generates huge amounts of wastewater as
   well as large energy demand. Additionally, fossil fuel's combustion for
   energy production causes the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and
   other pollutants. Therefore, there is a strong need to find alternative
   green approaches for wastewater treatment and energy production.
   Microalgae biorefineries could represent an effective strategy to
   mitigate the above problems. Microalgae biorefineries are a sustainable
   alternative to conventional wastewater treatment processes, as they
   potentially allow wastewater to be treated at lower costs and with lower
   energy consumption. Furthermore, they provide an effective means to
   recover valuable compounds for biofuel production or other applications.
   This review focuses on the current scenario and future prospects of
   microalgae biorefineries aimed at combining wastewater treatment with
   biofuel production. First, the different microalgal cultivation systems
   are examined, and their main characteristics and limitations are
   discussed. Then, the technologies available for converting the biomass
   produced during wastewater treatment into biofuel are critically
   analyzed. Finally, current challenges and research directions for
   biofuel production and wastewater treatment through this approach are
   outlined.

AB In the wake of the uprising global energy crisis, microalgae have
   emerged as an alternate feedstock for biofuel production. In addition,
   microalgae bear immense potential as bio-cell factories in terms of
   producing key chemicals, recombinant proteins, enzymes, lipid, hydrogen
   and alcohol. Abstraction of such high-value products (algal biorefinery
   approach) facilitates to make microalgae-based renewable energy an
   economically viable option. Synthetic biology is an emerging field that
   harmoniously blends science and engineering to help design and construct
   novel biological systems, with an aim to achieve rationally formulated
   objectives. However, resources and tools used for such nuclear
   manipulation, construction of synthetic gene network and genome-scale
   reconstruction of microalgae are limited. Herein, we present recent
   developments in the upcoming field of microalgae employed as a model
   system for synthetic biology applications and highlight the importance
   of genome-scale reconstruction models and kinetic models, to maximize
   the metabolic output by understanding the intricacies of algal growth.
   This review also examines the role played by microalgae as
   biorefineries, microalgal culture conditions and various operating
   parameters that need to be optimized to yield biofuel that can be
   economically competitive with fossil fuels.

AB Despite claims that microalgal biofuels are environmentally friendlier
   alternatives to conventional fuels, debate surrounding its ecological
   benefits or drawbacks still exists. LCA is used to analyze various
   biofuel production technologies from 'cradle to gate'. Energy and CO2
   balances are carried out for a hypothetical integrated PBR-raceway
   microalgae-to-biodiesel production in Singapore. Based on a functional
   unit of 1 MJ biofuel, the total energy demands are 4.44 MJ with 13% from
   biomass production, 85% from lipid extraction, and 2% from biodiesel
   production. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for adjustments in
   energy requirements, percentage lipid contents, and lower/higher heating
   product value. An 'Optimistic Case' was projected with estimates of: 45%
   lipid content; reduced energy needs for lipid extraction (1.3 MJ per MJ
   biodiesel); and heating value of biodiesel (42 MJ/kg). The life cycle
   energy requirements dropped significantly by about 60%. The results are
   compared with other published case studies from other countries.

AB The importance of expanding our knowledge on microorganisms derived from
   extreme environments stems from the development of novel and sustainable
   technologies for our health, food, and environment. Microalgae and
   cyanobacteria represent a group of diverse microorganisms that inhabit a
   wide range of environments, are capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, and
   form a thick microbial mat even at extreme environments. Studies of
   thermophilic microorganisms have shown a considerable biotechnological
   potential due to their optimum growth and metabolisms at high
   temperatures (≥50°C), which is supported by their thermostable enzymes.
   Microalgal and cyanobacterial communities present in high-temperature
   ecosystems account for a large part of the total ecosystem biomass and
   productivity, and can be exploited to generate several value-added
   products of agricultural, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and industrial
   relevance. This review provides an overview on the current status of
   biotechnological applications of thermophilic microalgae and

AB The industrial cultivation of microalgae can produce oil and protein
   rich biomass at areal yields higher than those of conventional
   agriculture. Given that algae has been demonstrated as both a potential
   biofuel and a food product, it is important to consider the
   environmental and economic tradeoffs associated with these uses. Here we
   evaluate the financial value of capital options for three processing
   strategies that produce food and fuel from algae. We show, in stochastic
   price regimes for production inputs and outputs, that the greatest
   returns are achieved when algal biomass is valorized as a high value
   fishmeal replacement. A co-production technology strategy that valorizes
   extracted oils as fuel and residual biomass as fishmeal replacement can
   enable the economic production of a renewable biofuel. Consistent with
   other studies, fuel-only production remains uneconomical, but becomes
   preferred if a low value commodity crop substitute is considered as the
   rendered food product. Potential improvements in capital and operational
   costs to enable economic production of fuel and low-value food are
   explored. Multimodal biorefineries ensure continued production during
   periods that are economically unfavorable with a single-mode approach,
   but have lower returns due to larger upfront capital investment. An
   analysis of a biorefinery with fuel, food, and coproduction modes
   demonstrated that mode selection was mostly influenced by output product
   prices when food and energy prices were competitive. Nitrogen fertilizer
   prices had a moderate influence on mode selection, while other inputs
   (phosphorus, electricity, natural gas) had negligible influence. The
   application of a carbon tax places a penalty on food production, but
   improves returns when renewable electricity is utilized in production.
   This analysis demonstrates an approach for evaluating financial
   tradeoffs at the food-energy nexus under uncertain market conditions.

AB The world energy system faces two major challenges: the requirement for
   more energy and less carbon. It is important to address biofuels
   production as an alternative to the usage of fossil fuel by utilizing
   microalgae as the potential feedstock. Yet, the commercialization of
   microalgae remains contentious caused by factors relating to the life
   cycle assessment and feasibility of microalgae-based biofuels. This
   present review starts with an introduction to the benefits of
   microalgae, followed by intensive elaboration on microalgae cultivation
   parameters. Subsequently, the fundamental principle along with the
   advantages and disadvantages of various pretreatment techniques of
   microalgae were reviewed. In addition, the conventional and recent
   advances in lipid extraction techniques from microalgae were
   comprehensively evaluated. Comparative analysis regard to the gaps from
   previous studies was discussed point-by-point in each section. The
   effort presented in this review will provide an insight for future
   researches dealing with microalgae-biofuel production on downstream
   processing.

AB Anaerobic digestion has emerged as the preferred treatment for organic
   fraction of municipal solid waste. Digestate management strategies are
   devised not only for safe disposal but also to increase the value and
   marketability. Regulations and standards for digestate management are
   framed to address the pollution concerns, conserve vulnerable zones,
   prevent communicable diseases, and to educate on digestate storage and
   applications. Regulations and the desired end uses are the main drivers
   for the enhancement of digestate through pretreatment, in vessel
   cleaning, and post-digestion treatment technologies for solid and liquid
   fractions of digestate. The current management practice involves
   utilization of digestate for land application either as fertilizer or
   soil improver. Prospects are bright for alternative usage such as
   microalgal cultivation, biofuel and bioethanol production. Presently,
   the focus of optimization of the anaerobic digestion process is directed
   only towards enhancing biogas yield, ignoring the quality of digestate
   produced. A paradigm shift is needed in the approach from 'biogas
   optimization' to 'integrated biogas-digestate optimization'.

AB Carbohydrate content of microalgae biomass can be increased and
   modulated. The nutrient limitation strategy may be promising when
   employed in a two-stage process, to limit carbohydrate productivity
   compromising biomass production. In this study, the effects of pH,
   nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus concentration onChlorella
   vulgarisgrowth and carbohydrate accumulation were evaluated.
   Carbohydrate content reached 58% on the 14th cultivation day, with a
   biomass concentration of 0.876  0.037 g/L, when microalga was cultured
   in modified BG-11 medium (35 mg/L K2HPO4, 80 MgSO4.7H2O mg/L,
   nitrogen-depleted and pH 9). Under these conditions, carbohydrate
   productivity was enhanced by 72.04%, in comparison to the standard
   medium. In addition, the sugar profile of the microalgae cultivated in
   the modified nitrogen-depleted medium was altered, displaying a shift in
   microalgae metabolism towards carbohydrate accumulation. The hydrolysis
   and fermentation performance of the carbohydrate-rich microalgae biomass
   was assessed through different methods for process endorsement, and
   resulted in high reducing sugars release (5.48 g/L of glucose from 10
   g/L of biomass), and theoretical ethanol yield (69%), highlighting the
   impact and feasibility of bioethanol 3G production.

AB Seaweed is of importance to the environment due to properties such as
   its CO2 sequestration capability. On the other hand, plastic is a
   versatile material important to society. Unfortunately, the abundance of
   both plastics and seaweed represents a challenge due to the need of
   adequate waste management. At first, algae and plastics might not appear
   suitable for energy recovery; however, with co-gasification, the results
   are promising. This work presents a model to simulate the
   co-gasification of Chlorella vulgaris, Sargassum fluitans, and Sargassum
   natans with plastics. The effect of the gasification temperature
   (650-850°C), equivalence ratio (0.25-0.45), and plastics/biomass ratio
   (0.0-1.0) on the produced gas's lower heating value, tar concentration,
   and composition is assessed. Moreover, the environmental performance of
   using plastic to enhance the syngas produced from the co-gasification
   with sargassum is assessed using the life cycle assessment methodology.
   The results indicate that the lower heating value increases with the
   temperature and plastics/biomass ratio. Moreover, tar increases with the
   quantity of plastics, varying between 20 and 50 g/Nm3. Finally, adding
   plastics to algae during gasification reduces the variability in the
   syngas composition, simplifying the post-processing stage. With respect
   to environmental performance, gasification has an impact similar to
   those of pyrolysis and recycling, but the performance could improve with
   sufficient research and development.

AB Catalysts with hierarchical porous structures and increased active
   defects play a crucial role in catalyzing the conversion of microalgae
   lipids. However, the template methods used for pore expansion and the
   acidification process employed to enhance activity are cumbersome and
   prone to deactivation. It is necessary to propose a simple and versatile
   synthetic approach to overcome these challenges. By modulating N,
   N-dimethylformamide basicity with formic acid, MOF-808 exhibited
   enhanced coordination of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid to
   Zr-clusters, creating three types of functional defects. These defects
   increased pore size from 1.63 nm to 5.34 nm and enhanced catalyst
   acidity by 22.8%, while maintaining high porosity. The active catalytic
   sites were confirmed to be defect sites (exposed Zr4+) through density
   functional theory. Compared to regular MOF-808, catalyst MOF-808-3/1
   shows enhanced hierarchical porosity and increased acidity, enabling
   efficient conversions at reduced reaction temperature (100°C) and
   pressure (352 kPa) compared to 200°C and 4036 kPa, respectively.

AB Algal biomass has significant advantages over terrestrial plants in
   terms of CO2 sequestration, biomass productivity, wastewater treatment
   along with multiple biobased products synthesis. Metabolic versatility
   and high carbohydrate content of microalgal biomass act as a potential
   alternative feedstock to fossil resources and contribute towards the
   biobased economy growth. Effective biomass utilization would play a key
   role to establish sustainable bioprocess development and technology
   translation to the industrial community. In this framework, the present
   review discusses the renewable resource potential of algal biomass and
   its complete utilization for multiple biobased products synthesis in a
   closed-loop biorefinery approach. Various methods are discussed to
   obtain high biomass growth and pretreatments to obtain the maximum
   sugars solubilization. Further, combined bioprocesses were discussed for
   the production of biohydrogen, biomethane, bioethanol, short-chain fatty
   acids (SCFA), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA), and biopolymers in a
   closed-loop approach.

AB Microalgae represent a potential source of renewable nutrition and there
   is growing interest in algae-based dietary supplements in the form of
   whole biomass, e.g.,ChlorellaandArthrospira, or purified extracts
   containing omega-3 fatty acids and carotenoids. The commercial
   production of bioactive compounds from microalgae is currently
   challenged by the biorefinery process. This review focuses on the
   biochemical composition of microalgae, the complexities of mass
   cultivation, as well as potential therapeutic applications. The
   advantages of open and closed growth systems are discussed, including
   common problems encountered with large-scale growth systems. Several
   methods are used for the purification and isolation of bioactive
   compounds, and many products from microalgae have shown potential as
   antioxidants and treatments for hypertension, among other health
   conditions. However, there are many unknown algal metabolites and
   potential impurities that could cause harm, so more research is needed
   to characterize strains of interest, improve overall operation, and
   generate safe, functional products.

AB An expeditious pace of expanding industrialization and urbanization is a
   global vulnerability which immediately requires utmost attention towards
   the replacement of prosaic petroleum-based polymer assimilation. Thus,
   greening the innovative route of microalgae derived biopolymers has
   attained significant interest as an improved and sustainable approach
   towards the worldwide circular bioeconomy. In this context, the use of
   as synthesized biopolymers from microalgae attributing as a potential
   feedstock has bestowed for a biodegradable solution to reduce the
   greenhouse gases emission and rapid biomass productivity with metabolic
   flexibility. However, the confront of high microalgae cultivation cost
   and low metabolites' accumulation have triggered the advancement of
   microalgae metabolic cultivation strategy. Hence, the current review
   portrays to propose a novel multi-phasic fed batch light depleted
   low-cost wastewater cultivation approach and a clear mechanistic
   phenomenon for accelerating the biopolymer production. This review also
   provides a comprehensive summary on several microalgae strains which are
   capable for biopolymer synthesis and various effective extraction
   techniques to isolate the biopolymers. The future endeavour and
   challenges on the microalgae circular bioeconomy which involves the
   current issues regarding the cell harvesting method, scale up and
   bioprocessing cost of microalgae cultivation have been highlighted. The
   applications for microalgae derived biopolymer in industrial and
   nutraceutical sectors have also been emphasized. This review is expected
   to bring new insights to the industrial stakeholders for further
   advancement of microalgae-based biopolymer field economically, and
   eventually contributing towards environmental sustainability.

AB Fixing airborne nutrients from animal feeding operations (AFOs) into
   microalgal biomass could alleviate AFOs air emissions and reduce
   microalgal production cost. The aim of this study was to conduct a
   technical and economic assessment of integrating air emissions
   mitigation with microalgal cultivation. Experiments were conducted to
   determine technical feasibility for three air emission scenarios of
   exhaust gases, dust (particulate matter), and exhaust air. In the first
   scenario, microalgalScenedesmusandDesmodesmusgrowing on the nutrients
   from exhaust gases had 92.7 and 71.0% of NH3mitigation efficiency with
   biomass productivities of 11.2 and 21.5 g/m2per day, respectively. In
   the second scenario, particulate matter from AFOs provided essential
   nutrients forDesmodesmuscultivation. The nutrient recoveries were 0.08
   mg NH4+-N/mg biomass, 0.13 mg NO3--N/mg biomass, and 0.03 mg PO43--P/mg
   biomass. The biomass productivity was 21.4 g/m2per day. In the third
   scenario, exhaust air from AFOs was the nutrient source to culture three
   microalgae ofScenedesmus,Chlorella, andChlamydomonas. The corresponding
   microalgal biomass productivities were 14.5, 9.7, and 8.7 g/m2per day.
   Four conceptual cases were applied to assess the economic feasibility of
   the integrated air emission mitigation and microalgae cultivation. The
   results demonstrated that using the recovered CO2and nutrients in
   exhaust air could significantly reduce the cost of microalgal culture
   systems, and a net revenue of $0.0005/egg could be achieved by the
   integrated system with improved microalgal biomass productivity of 20
   g/m2per day.

SO Journal of Cleaner Production

U1 8
U2 133
AB Thermochemical processing technologies such as hydrothermal
   liquefaction/carbonization/gasification, pyrolysis, torrefaction, and
   gasification have been widely used for the production of oil, char, and
   gas fuels from biomass. However, aqueous phase (AP), a co-product or
   process wastewater with high concentrations of carbon, nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and other elements, is inevitably produced in massive
   amounts after thermochemical treatment. The treatment and utilization of
   AP is one of the bottlenecks for the industrialization of biomass
   processing technologies. In this review, the production and
   characteristics of AP from dry and wet thermochemical processes were
   compared. Various AP valorization pathways were comprehensively
   discussed, including (i) the direct utilization of AP as a solvent,
   reaction medium, or a culture nutrient source for the cultivation of
   organisms such as microalgae; (ii) the separation and purification of
   nutrients such as struvite or chemicals such as carboxylic acids from
   AP, and (iii) the conversion of AP components to energy and fuels such
   as bioelectricity, biohydrogen, biogas, syngas, bioethanol, or chemicals
   such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) through fermentation, anaerobic
   digestion, microbial electrolysis cells, microbial fuel cells,
   supercritical water gasification, and catalytic reforming. Finally,
   various strategies have been proposed to promote future research,
   including matching AP with preferable valorization technology, tuning AP
   compositions and properties (e.g., detoxification of AP), and process
   optimization and integration. This review could also be conducive to
   promoting the utilization of organic wastewater from other sources.

AB The cultivation of microalgae and microalgae-bacteria consortia provide
   a potential efficient strategy to fix CO2from waste gas, treat

   reviews recent developments in CO2fixation and wastewater treatment by
   single microalgae, mixed microalgae and microalgae-bacteria consortia,
   as well as compares and summarizes the differences in utilizing
   different microorganisms from different aspects. Compared to monoculture
   of microalgae, a mixed microalgae and microalgae-bacteria consortium may
   mitigate environmental risk, obtain high biomass, and improve the
   efficiency of nutrient removal. The applied microalgae
   includeChlorellasp.,Scenedesmussp.,Pediastrumsp., andPhormidiumsp. among
   others, and most strains belong to Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta. The
   bacteria in microalgae-bacteria consortia are mainly from activated
   sludge and specific sewage sources. Bioengineer in CBB cycle in
   microalgae cells provide effective strategy to achieve improvement of
   CO2fixation or a high yield of high-value products. The mechanisms of
   CO2fixation and nutrient removal by different microbial systems are also
   explored and concluded, the importance of microalgae in the technology
   is proven. After cultivation, microalgae biomass can be harvested
   through physical, chemical, biological and magnetic separation methods
   and used to produce high-value by-products, such as biofuel, feed, food,
   biochar, fertilizer, and pharmaceutical bio-compounds. Although this
   technology has brought many benefits, some challenging obstacles and
   limitation remain for industrialization and commercializing.

AB High oil prices and global warming that accompany the use of fossil
   fuels are an incentive to find alternative forms of energy supply.
   Photosynthetic biofuel production represents one of these since for
   this, one uses renewable resources. Sunlight is used for the conversion
   of water and CO2into biomass. Two strategies are used in parallel:
   plant-based production via sugar fermentation into ethanol and biodiesel
   production through transesterification. Both, however, exacerbate other
   problems, including regional nutrient balancing and the world's food
   supply, and suffer from the modest efficiency of photosynthesis.
   Maximizing the efficiency of natural and engineered photosynthesis is
   therefore of utmost importance. Algal photosynthesis is the system of
   choice for this particularly for energy applications. Complete
   conversion of CO2intobiomassis not necessary for this. Innovative
   methods ofsynthetic biologyallow one to combine photosynthetic and
   fermentative metabolism via the so-calledPhotanolapproach to form
   biofuel directly from Calvin cycle intermediates through use of the
   naturally transformable cyanobacteriumSynechocystissp. PCC 6803. Beyond
   providing transport energy and chemical feedstocks, photosynthesis will
   continue to be used for food and feed applications. Also for this
   application, arguments of efficiency will become more and more important
   as the size of the world population continues to increase.
   Photosynthetic cells can be used for food applications in various
   innovative forms, e.g., as a substitute for the fish proteins in the
   diet supplied to carnivorous fish or perhaps - after acid hydrolysis -
   as a complex, animal-free serum for growth of mammalian cells in vitro.

AB The use of fossil fuels is now widely accepted as unsustainable due to
   depleting resources and the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the
   environment that have already exceeded the "dangerously high" threshold
   of 450 ppm CO2-e. To achieve environmental and economic sustainability,
   fuel production processes are required that are not only renewable, but
   also capable of sequestering atmospheric CO2. Currently, nearly all
   renewable energy sources (e.g. hydroelectric, solar, wind, tidal,
   geothermal) target the electricity market, while fuels make up a much
   larger share of the global energy demand (66%). Biofuels are therefore
   rapidly being developed. Second generation microalgal systems have the
   advantage that they can produce a wide range of feedstocks for the
   production of biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane and biohydrogen.
   Biodiesel is currently produced from oil synthesized by conventional
   fuel crops that harvest the sun's energy and store it as chemical
   energy. This presents a route for renewable and carbon-neutral fuel
   production. However, current supplies from oil crops and animal fats
   account for only approximately 0.3% of the current demand for transport
   fuels. Increasing biofuel production on arable land could have severe
   consequences for global food supply. In contrast, producing biodiesel
   from algae is widely regarded as one of the most efficient ways of
   generating biofuels and also appears to represent the only current
   renewable source of oil that could meet the global demand for transport
   fuels. The main advantages of second generation microalgal systems are
   that they: (1) Have a higher photon conversion efficiency (as evidenced
   by increased biomass yields per hectare): (2) Can be harvested
   batch-wise nearly all-year-round, providing a reliable and continuous
   supply of oil: (3) Can utilize salt and waste water streams, thereby
   greatly reducing freshwater use: (4) Can couple CO2-neutral fuel
   production with CO2 sequestration: (5) Produce non-toxic and highly
   biodegradable biofuels. Current limitations exist mainly in the
   harvesting process and in the supply of CO2 for high efficiency
   production. This review provides a brief overview of second generation
   biodiesel production systems using microalgae.

AB Microalgae that can grow fast and convert solar energy into chemical
   energy efficiently are being considered as a promising feedstock of
   renewable biofuel. Mass production of microalgal oil faces a number of
   technical barriers that make the current production of biodiesel
   economically unfeasible. Small size (1-20 m) and negatively charged
   surface of the microalgal cells pose difficulties in the process of
   harvesting. This leads to significant increase in the overall cost of
   biomass production. The present study explored different methods and
   conditions for harvesting of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis
   PCC 6803. A customized air-lift reactor was used for the cultivation of
   biomass under photoautotrophic condition. Significant improvement in the
   rate of productivity of biomass was observed. Maximum biomass
   productivity of 0.25, 0.14 g L-1 d-1 for Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and
   Synechocystis PCC 6803, respectively, were obtained. Various
   flocculation techniques viz. auto-flocculation, inorganic, chitosan and
   electrolytic flocculation were used for the recovery of biomass. Among
   all the techniques, electro-flocculation showed high flocculation
   efficiency (98%) and floatation of floc causing easy harvesting.
   Moreover, low-cost and easy control of the process justify
   electro-flocculation as a most suitable and promising technique for the
   recovery of microalgal cells.

AB Eutrophicated inland water bodies are noticed to be one of the
   contributing factors to greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Direct
   discharge of untreated or partially treated water is a major concern.
   Microalgae-based technology and management are regarded as one of the
   potential nature-based approaches to combat eutrophication. In turn, the
   microalgae facilitate the recovery of GHGs contributing compounds in the
   form of organic biomass. The recovered algal biomass can be harnessed
   for the production of biofuels and other bio-products, like
   biofertilizer, using anaerobic digestion. By virtue, circular
   bio-economy can be achieved alongside mitigating GHGs emissions. Before
   implementing, it is vital to thoroughly explore the links between the
   process and potential alternatives for wastewater treatment, waste
   valorization, biofuel production, and land usage. Thus, the present
   review discusses the impact of eutrophication on ecology and
   environment, current technologies for mitigating eutrophication and
   GHGs, and energy recovery through the anaerobic digestion of algal
   biomass. Further, the processes at the intercept of wastewater treatment
   and biogas production were reviewed to leverage the potential of
   anaerobic digestion for making a circular bioeconomy framework.

AB Microalgae-based biodiesel synthesis is currently not commercially
   viable due to the high costs of culture realizations and low lipid
   yields. The main objective of the current study was to determine the
   possibility of growing Nannochloropsis oceanica on Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae yeast wastewater for biodiesel generation at an economical
   rate. N. oceanica was grown in Guillard F/2 synthetic medium and three
   dilutions of yeast wastewater (1, 1.25, and 1.5%). Biodiesel properties,
   in addition to carbohydrate, protein, lipid, dry weight, biomass, lipid
   productivity, amino acids, and fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs) content,
   were analyzed and the quality of the produced biodiesel is assessed. The
   data revealed the response of N. oceanica to nitrogen-deficiency in the
   three dilutions of yeast wastewater. N. oceanica in Y2 (1.25%) yeast
   wastewater dilution exhibited the highest total carbohydrate and lipid
   percentages (21.19% and 41.97%, respectively), and the highest lipid
   productivity (52.46 mg L-1 day -1) under nitrogen deficiency in yeast
   wastewater. The fatty acids profile shows that N. oceanica cultivated in
   Y2 (1.25%) wastewater dilution provides a significant level of TSFA
   (47.42%) and can be used as a feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. In
   addition, N. oceanica responded to nitrogen shortage in wastewater
   dilutions by upregulating the gene encoding delta-9 fatty acid
   desaturase (Delta9FAD). As a result, the oleic and palmitoleic acid
   levels increased in the fatty acid profile of Y2 yeast wastewater
   dilution, highlighting the increased activity of Delta9FAD enzyme in
   transforming stearic acid and palmitic acid into oleic acid and
   palmitoleic acid. This study proved that the Y2 (1.25%) yeast wastewater
   dilution can be utilized as a growth medium for improving the quantity
   of specific fatty acids and lipid productivity in N. oceanica that
   affect biodiesel quality to satisfy global biodiesel requirements.

AB This paper presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of industrial scale
   microalgae biomass production in compact photobioreactor (PBR) systems
   (2*5*8 m) for supplying biofuel/electricity generation processes and
   synthesis of new materials. Other objectives are as follows: (i) to
   compare the impact of various raw materials, substances, and services;
   and (ii) to evaluate environment-relevant aspects of the proposed system
   as compared to microalgae raceway ponds. The life cycle inventory
   assessment shows that (i) only atmospheric CO2is used for PBR microalgae
   cultivation, whereas in raceway ponds, injection of CO2from fossil
   origin is largely required to allow for microalgae growth; and (ii) the
   PBR daily production rate of dry biomass is currently at 1.5 kg
   m-3day-1for each PBR, which is 12.82 times larger than the reported
   average 0.117 kg m-3day-1raceway ponds production. It is found that in
   general the association of the effects of the production of steel, PVC,
   and the packaging contribute to more than 85% of the total impact in
   each analyzed category. Therefore, to achieve PBR biomass production
   impact reduction and sustainability, PVC and steel utilization need to
   be minimized, as well as packaging materials. Based on the PBR LCA
   results, that is, due to no CO2injection from fossil origin and low area
   occupation, it is expected that high density production of truly
   renewable microalgae biomass could be obtained from PBR systems.

AB Utilization of sustainable natural resources such as microalgae has been
   considered for the production of biofuels, aquaculture feed, high-value
   bioactives such as omega-3 fatty acids, carotenoids, etc.
   Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 fatty acid present in fish
   oil, which is of physiological importance to both humans and fish.
   Marine microalgae are sustainable sources of lipid rich in EPA, and
   different species have been explored for the production of EPA as a
   single product. There has been a rising interest in the concept of a
   multi-product biorefinery, focusing on the maximum valorization of the
   algal biomass. Targeting one or more value-added compounds in a
   biorefinery scenario can improve the commercial viability of low-value
   products such as triglycerides for biofuel. This approach has been
   viewed by technologists and experts as a sustainable and economically
   feasible possibility for the large-scale production of microalgae for
   its potential applications in biodiesel and jet fuel production,
   nutraceuticals, animal and aquaculture feeds, etc. In this review paper,
   we describe the recent developments in the production of high-value
   EPA-rich oil from microalgae, emphasizing the upstream and downstream
   bioprocess techniques, and the advantages of considering an EPA-rich
   oil-based biorefinery.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The presence of heavy metals, specifically
   cadmium, in the environment poses significant threats to both ecological
   systems and human health. However, microalgae have shown potential in
   addressing this issue through their ability to absorb cadmium and
   produce valuable biomass, making them a promising solution for
   bioremediation. Among the various microalgae species,Chlorella
   vulgarisstands out as a suitable candidate due to its potential for
   biodiesel production and its capacity to effectively absorb cadmium.
   Therefore, the main objective of this study is to assess the toxicity of
   cadmium onChlorella vulgariscells using network meta-analysis as a
   methodology. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted on Scopus,
   Scilit, Google Scholar, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies
   published from 1 January 1990 to 16 January 2024. Only studies that
   reported the cell number ofChlorella vulgarisas a result of cadmium
   exposure were considered for inclusion. The collected data were then
   subjected to Bayesian frequentist network meta-analysis, utilizing
   standardized mean difference and a 95 percent confidence interval as
   measures of effect size. Additionally, a linear regression analysis was
   performed to examine the dose-dependent impact of cadmium toxicity.
   FINDINGS: Dose-dependent toxic effects of cadmium onChlorella
   vulgariswere evident (R-square of more than 0.90), particularly at a
   concentration of 1 part per million, deemed as the maximum tolerable
   threshold. Prolonged exposure revealed a concentration-dependent
   reduction in cell viability, suggesting potential lifespan shortening. A
   comparison of growth stimulants, gibberellic acid and brassinolide
   (standard means differences of 1.7 and 3.8, respectively), in mitigating
   cadmium toxicity indicated the latter superior effectiveness in
   sustaining microalgal survivability. The presence of high nitrogen and
   low phosphorous levels was found to be significantly associated with a
   reduction inChlorella vulgariscells due to cadmium exposure. CONCLUSION:
   This research has provided conclusive proof of the harmful effects of
   cadmium onChlorella vulgaristhrough the implementation of Bayesian
   frequentist network meta-analysis, offering valuable insights for
   environmental management practices. The findings reveal
   concentration-dependent effects of cadmium toxicity. The survivability
   ofChlorella vulgarisis determined by the compositions of macronutrients
   nitrogen and phosphorous. Comparative analyses highlight the superior
   protective effect of brassinolide over gibberellic acid in mitigating
   cadmium toxicity. Overall, the findings highlight the potential
   ofChlorella vulgarisin both bioremediation of heavy metals and biomass
   production.

AB The microalgae Chlorella vulgaris produce lipids that after extraction
   from cells can be converted into biodiesel. However, these lipids cannot
   be efficiently extracted from cells due to the presence of the
   microalgae cell wall, which acts as a barrier for lipid removal when
   traditional extraction methods are employed. Therefore, a microalgae
   system with high lipid productivity and thinner cell walls could be more
   suitable for lipid production from microalgae. This study addresses the
   effect of culture conditions, specifically carbon dioxide and sodium
   nitrate concentrations, on biomass concentration and the ratio of lipid
   productivity/cellulose content. Optimization of culture conditions was
   done by response surface methodology. The empirical model for biomass
   concentration (R2=96.0%) led to a predicted maximum of 1123.2 mg dw L-1
   when carbon dioxide and sodium nitrate concentrations were 2.33% (v/v)
   and 5.77 mM, respectively. For lipid productivity/cellulose content
   ratio (R2=95.2%) the maximum predicted value was 0.46 (mg lipid L-1
   day-1)(mg cellulose mg biomass-1)-1 when carbon dioxide concentration
   was 4.02% (v/v) and sodium nitrate concentration was 3.21 mM. A common
   optimum point for both variables (biomass concentration and lipid
   productivity/cellulose content ratio) was also found, predicting a
   biomass concentration of 1119.7 mg dw L-1 and lipid
   productivity/cellulose content ratio of 0.44 (mg lipid L-1 day-1)(mg
   cellulose mg biomass-1)-1 for culture conditions of 3.77% (v/v) carbon
   dioxide and 4.01 mM sodium nitrate. The models were experimentally
   validated and results supported their accuracy. This study shows that it
   is possible to improve lipid productivity/cellulose content by
   manipulation of culture conditions, which may be applicable to any scale
   of bioreactors.

AB In the last few years, governments all around the world have agreed upon
   migrating towards carbon-neutral economies as a strategy for restraining
   the effects of climate change. A major obstacle limiting this
   achievement is greenhouse gases emissions, for which the aviation sector
   is a key contributor because of its dependence on fossil fuels. As an
   alternative, biofuels with similar characteristics to current
   fossil-fuels and fully compatible with the existing petroleum
   infrastructure (i.e., drop-in biofuels) are being developed. In this
   regard, microalgae are a promising feedstock thanks to, among other
   aspects, their potential for lipid accumulation. This review outlines
   the development status, opportunities, and challenges of different
   technologies that are capable of or applicable to transform microalgae
   into aviation fuels. To this effect, a baseline of the existing jet
   fuels and the requirements for potential aviation biofuels is initially
   presented. Then, microalgae production and valorization techniques are
   discussed with an emphasis on the thermochemical pathways. Finally, an
   assessment of the present techno-economic feasibility of
   microalgae-derived aviation fuels is discussed, along with the authors'
   point of view on the suitability of these techniques. Further
   developments are needed to reduce the costs of cultivation and
   harvesting of microalgae, and a biorefinery approach might improve the
   economics of the overall process. In addition, while each of the
   conversion routes described has its advantages and drawbacks, they
   converge upon the need of optimizing the deoxygenation techniques and
   the proportion of the suitable type of hydrocarbons that match fuel
   requirements.

AB Increasing demand and depleting resources leads to the search of new
   method for the treatment and reuse of waste water generated becomes a
   big challenge. The project discusses about the possibilities in
   integrated reuse of grey water. The secondarily treated grey water is
   rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients; hence it needs a
   tertiary treatment to eliminate these compounds. The tertiary treatment
   was carried out using the microalgae Botryococcus braunii grown in
   laboratory, the microalgae Botryococcuc braunii contains high amount of
   oil which can be used for the production of biodiesel. Experiments were
   carried out in laboratory scale Erlenmeyer flasks which was filled with
   secondarily treated grey water inoculated with microalgae Botryococcus
   braunii. The pH of the grey water was maintained under 7.51 in room
   temperature, 12 h light/12 h darkness cycles were maintained, light
   intensity has been maintained higher than 1.20.2 Klux. The compounds
   initially present in treated grey water like nitrogen and phosphorus is
   reduced considerably and it is used for landscaping purpose.

AB Cyanobacteria are an attractive host for biofuel production because they
   can produce valuable chemical compounds from CO2 fixed by
   photosynthesis. However, the available genetic tools that enable precise
   gene regulation for the applications of synthetic biology are
   insufficient. Previously, we engineered an RNA-based posttranscriptional
   regulator, termed riboregulator, for the control of target gene
   expression in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Moreover, we
   enhanced the gene regulation ability of the riboregulators in
   Escherichia coli by fusing and engineering a scaffold sequence derived
   from naturally occurring E. coli noncoding small RNAs. Here, we
   demonstrated that the scaffold sequence fused to the riboregulators
   improved their gene regulation ability in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. To
   further improve gene regulation, we expressed an exogenous RNA chaperone
   protein that is responsible for noncoding small RNA-mediated gene
   regulation, which resulted in higher target gene expression. The
   scaffold sequence derived from natural E. coli noncoding small RNAs is
   effective for designing RNA-based genetic tools and scaffold-fused
   riboregulators are a strong RNA-tool to regulate gene expression in
   cyanobacteria.

AB Microalgae have the potential to provide large amounts of
   lipid-containing biomass that could be used as a renewable oil feedstock
   for biofuel use. Many fast-growing algae, such as Chlorella vulgaris,
   when grown under nutrient-sufficient conditions, have a lipid profile
   that is unsuitable for biodiesel use, since the triacylglyceride content
   is too low. However, growth under nitrogen limitation has been shown to
   increase triacylglycerides. Here we investigate the most effective
   nitrogen-limitation regime and find that rather than transferring cells
   to a medium without nitrogen, the maximal triacylglyceride productivity
   (46 mg/l/day) is achieved by allowing the cells to deplete the nitrogen
   naturally. Detailed analysis of the fatty acid composition of the lipids
   indicated that there was a high proportion of alpha-linolenic acid
   (C18:3) under all conditions, so that it would have to be blended with
   other feedstocks in order to adhere to international standards for
   biodiesel.

AB Natural astaxanthin is a remarkable carotenoid with potent antioxidant
   activity, with a forseeable market value of $167.50 million by 2030
   mainly due to its high demand as human supplement. Haematococcus
   pluvialis is a promising source of natural astaxanthin (3.00-7.00% by
   dry weight) which is being globally cultivated at an industrial scale.
   Nonetheless, a significant hurdle to the industrial-scale
   commercialization of H. pluvialis-based astaxanthin is the high market
   price of H. pluvialis-based astaxanthin, despite the existence of
   well-established production facilities. Accordingly, the present review
   focuses on novel strategies applicable at industrial-scale cultivation
   of H. pluvialis to increase biomass productivity and astaxanthin yield.
   Many novel strategies during green-stage including the supplementation
   of chemical stimulants, mixotrophic cultivation, and prevention of
   culture contamination are extensively studied. Similarly, incorporation
   of oxidative stress-inducing chemicals, culture media dilution, and pH
   shock are exploited in literature during red-stage cultivation of H.
   pluvialis. Evidently, chemical stimulants improved H. pluvialis biomass
   concentration to 1.10-2.37 g L-1 in the green-stage cultivation, while
   oxidative stress inducing-chemical stimulants enhanced the astaxanthin
   yield to 33.24-46.00 mg g-1 during the red-stage cultivation. In
   addition, the future perspectives in the research domain are scrutinized
   with prominence on the techno-economic assessments of the novel
   strategies, development of innovative cultivation techniques,
   geolocation-based analysis, public perception and integration of
   biorefineries.

AB One challenge constraining the use of microalgae in the food and
   biofuels industry is growth and lipid accumulation. Microalgae with high
   growth characteristics are more likely to originate from the local
   environment. However, to be commercially effective, in addition to high
   growth microalgae must also have high lipid productivities and contain
   the desired fatty acids for their intended use. We isolated microalgae
   from intertidal locations in South East Queensland, Australia with
   adverse or fluctuating conditions, as these may harbor more
   opportunistic strains with high lipid accumulation potential. Screening
   was based on a standard protocol using growth rate and lipid
   accumulation as well as prioritizing fatty acid profiles suitable for
   biodiesel or nutraceuticals. Using these criteria, an initial selection
   of over 50 local microalgae strains from brackish and sea water was
   reduced to 16 strains considered suitable for further investigation.
   Among these 16 strains, the ones most likely to be effective for
   biodiesel feedstock wereNitzschiasp. CP3a,Tetraselmissp. M8,Cymbellasp.
   CP2b, andCylindrotheca closteriumSI1c, reaching growth rates of up to
   0.53 day-1and lipid productivities of 5.62 g mL-1day-1. Omega-3 fatty
   acids were found in some strains such asNitzschiasp. CP2a,Nitzschiasp.
   CP3a andCylindrotheca closteriumSI1c. These strains have potential for
   further research as commercial food supplements.

AB Two important challenges need to be addressed to realize a practical
   biorefinery for the conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals: (i)
   effective methods for the degradation and fractionation of
   lignocelluloses and (ii) efficient and robust chemical methods for the
   conversion of bio-feeds to target productsviahighly selective catalytic
   reactions. Ultrasonic energy promotes the pretreatment and conversion
   process through its special cavitational effects. In this review, recent
   progress and methods for combining and integrating sonication into
   biomass pretreatment and conversion for fuels and chemicals are
   critically assessed. Ultrasonic energy combined with proper solvents
   allows destruction of the recalcitrant lignocellulosic structure,
   fractionation of biomass components, and then assists many
   thermochemical and biochemical reactions, with increased equilibrium
   yields of sugars, bio-ethanol and gas products by 10-300%. Sonication
   promotes hydrolysis, esterification and transesterification in biodiesel
   synthesis and leads to reduced reaction time by 50-80%, lower reaction
   temperature, less amounts of solvent and catalyst than comparable
   unsonicated reaction systems. For algal biomass, sonication benefits the
   disruption, lysis and content release of macro and microalgae cells, and
   reduces the time required for subsequent extraction and
   chemical/biochemical reactions, with efficiencies typically being
   improved by 120-200%. High-frequency ultrasound of 1-3 MHz allows
   harvesting of microalgae, liquid product separation andin-situprocess
   monitoring of biomass reactions, while high-intensity ultrasound at
   20-50 kHz activates heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysis of the biomass
   reactions. The use of ultrasound in conversion of biomass to biofuels
   provides a positive process benefit.

AB An Indo-US workshop on "Cyanobacteria: molecular networks to biofuels"
   was held December 16-20, 2012 at Lagoona Resort, Lonavala, India. The
   workshop was jointly organized by two of the authors, PPW, a chemical
   engineer and LAS, a biologist, thereby ensuring a broad and
   cross-disciplinary participation. The main objective of the workshop was
   to bring researchers from academia and industry of the two countries
   together with common interests in cyanobacteria or microalgae and
   derived biofuels. An exchange of ideas resulted from a series of oral
   and poster presentations and, importantly, through one-on-one
   discussions during tea breaks and meals. Another key objective was to
   introduce young researchers of India to the exciting field of
   cyanobacterial physiology, modeling, and biofuels. PhD students and
   early stage researchers were especially encouraged to participate and
   about half of the 75 participants belonged to this category. The rest
   were comprised of senior researchers, including 13-15 invited speakers
   from each country. Overall, twenty-four institutes from 12 states of
   India were represented. The deliberations, which are being compiled in
   the present special issue, revolved mainly around molecular aspects of
   cyanobacterial biofuels including metabolic engineering, networks,
   genetic regulation, circadian rhythms, and stress responses.
   Representatives of some key funding agencies and industry provided a
   perspective and opportunities in the field and for bilateral
   collaboration. This article summarizes deliberations that took place at
   the meeting and provides a bird's eye view of the ongoing research in
   the field in the two countries.

AB Microalgal biofuel is a promising solution to replace fossil fuel as a
   renewable and environmental-friendly energy source, thereby contributing
   to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in
   particular SDG-7, or Affordable and Clean Energy. Unlike energy crops
   (like oil palm and sugar cane), microalgae benefit from faster growth
   rate, higher lipid content, smaller land area required, ability to
   flourish using waste or brackish water, and posing zero competition with
   food crops. Microalgae-derived biofuels (like biodiesel, bioethanol,
   biomethane, and biohydrogen) are sustainable energy sources that can be
   produced using well-developed techniques (e.g., transesterification,
   fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and Fisher-Tropsch process). To
   prevent dire climate conditions resulting from the global temperature
   rise of 1.5°C and resolve worldwide energy security issue, our
   generation will need to establish and implement renewables on a global
   scale. To improve the industrial production of microalgal biofuel, the
   efficiencies of biomass and metabolite production to post-cultivation
   biofuel synthesis processes must be enhanced. For the cultivation step,
   there exist three key techniques that can directly change the traits,
   structure, and behavior of microalgal cells, and induce them to
   accumulate targeted metabolites rapidly and in large amounts. These
   techniques are genetic engineering, chemical modulation, and
   nanomaterial approach. Genetic engineering commonly alters the
   chloroplast DNA of microalgae to overexpress or down-regulate key genes
   in various metabolic pathways so that the cells accumulate more lipids.
   Chemicals can also be used to modulate microalgal growth and lipid
   accumulation by inducing oxidative stress or prevent conversion of lipid
   molecules. Nanomaterials and nanoparticles can also enhance microalgal
   lipid production by microenvironmental stress induction, vitamin
   supplementation, and light backscattering. Therefore, in this review,
   the recent progress as well as the pros and cons of genetic engineering,
   chemical modulation, and nanomaterial approach in achieving greater
   biofuel production from microalgae are comprehensively examined.

AB The main challenge for an efficient anaerobic digestion using microalgal
   substrates is the optimization of cell wall disruption pretreatments.
   The objective of this work was to assess methane yield improvement using
   thermally pretreated Chlorella vulgaris in semicontinuous feeding
   operation. After thermal pretreatment, organic matter hydrolysis was
   confirmed by a 10-fold increase in soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD).
   Total COD removals ranged 36.5-49.7% for reactors fed with raw and
   thermally pretreated biomass, respectively. Despite the high nitrogen
   mineralization registered (52 and 78% for raw and thermally treated C.
   vulgaris), no ammonium/ammonia inhibition was detected. The reactor fed
   with thermally pretreated biomass resulted in 50% methane yield
   enhancement compared with the reactor fed with raw biomass. Even though
   no common inhibitions were detected, methane yield values attained were
   comparably lower than that obtained in batch mode digestion. This study
   highlighted the need of further testing promising pretreatments in
   semicontinuous mode anaerobic digestion before claiming their
   effectiveness.

AB Microalgae have high potential to remove inorganic nutrients from
   wastewater and to produce biodiesel. Effects of nitrogen and phosphorus
   concentrations on growth, nutrient uptake, and lipid accumulation of a
   freshwater microalga Scenedesmus sp. LX1 were studied. Scenedesmus sp.
   LX1's growth was in accordance with the Monod model. The following Monod
   parameters were obtained: the N- and P-saturated maximum growth rate was
   2.21*106 cells mL-1 d-1, and the half-saturation constants of N and P
   uptake were 12.1 mg L-1 and 0.27 mg L-1, respectively. In the
   nitrogen/phosphorus ratio of 5:1-12:1, 83-99% nitrogen and 99%
   phosphorus could be removed. In conditions of nitrogen (2.5 mg L-1) or
   phosphorus (0.1 mg L-1) limitation, Scenedesmus sp. LX1 could accumulate
   lipids to as high as 30% and 53%, respectively, of its algal biomass.
   The lipid productivity/unit volume of culture, however, was not
   enhanced. Further research should be made on how to enhance both lipid
   content and lipid productivity.

AB The increase in food waste generation has resulted in significant
   challenges for its sustainable management. Anaerobic digestion coupled
   with microalgae-based ponds for digestate treatment can be used as a
   low-cost eco-friendly technology approach. In this case, microalgal
   biomass harvested from the ponds may be valorized into bioenergy
   (biogas) and soil conditioner and/or biofertilizers. The aim of the
   present study was to evaluate the microalgal biomass produced from a
   food waste digestate treatment ponds as agricultural fertilizer. For
   this purpose, microalgal biomass was tested before and after anaerobic
   digestion and co-digestion with food waste, exploring its potential for
   valorization. The inorganic fertilizer urea and soil with no
   fertilization were also used as treatments. The experimental design
   consisted of applying the treatments in pots cultivated with hybrid
   grass Brachiariacv. Sabia and distributed in randomized blocks in a
   controlled greenhouse. Microalgal biomass was mainly composed by
   Scenedesmus sp.. The assessed parameters showed comparable results on
   plant growth (i.e. number of tillers, fresh and dry matter and
   Chlorophyll content index) for fresh and digested microalgal biomass and
   inorganic fertilizer. Furthermore, it was observed that fresh microalgae
   provided the highest Phosphorus content in the leaf (21%). Additionally,
   there were increases of 9% in Nitrogen and 12% in organic matter in the
   soil after applying digested microalgae compared to the control group
   without any fertilization. Finally, experimental data obtained suggests
   that microalgae-based biofertilizer holds the potential to replace
   inorganic fertilizer as a nutrient source. Moreover, it contributes to
   the valorization of by-products from organic waste treatment.

AB Microalgal biotechnology has emerged due to the health-promoting
   properties of microalgae related to their bioactive compounds and the
   great diversity of products that can be developed from algal biomass.
   Microalgal biomasses have been produced industrially for applications in
   different fields such as food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic,
   and animal feed industries. They can be cultivated either in open
   systems or in closed systems (photobioreactors). Another important area
   is the use of microalgal biomass for energy production. It has become
   obvious that petroleum-derived fuels are unsustainable, due to depleting
   world reserves and greenhouse gas emissions. Microalgae can provide
   several different types of renewable biofuels. These include methane
   produced by anaerobic digestion of the algal biomass, biodiesel derived
   from trans-esterification of microalgal lipids, bioethanol produced from
   carbohydrate fermentations, and photobiologically produced biohydrogen.
   The idea of using microalgae as a source of fuel is not new. However, it
   is now being taken seriously because of increases in petroleum prices
   and, more significantly, the increasing concern about global warming as
   associated with burning fossil fuels. This review offers an update on
   information about microalgae, specifically emphasizing their
   biotechnological importance.

AB Chlorella vulgarisaccumulates lipid under nitrogen limitation, but at
   the expense of biomass productivity. Due to this tradeoff, improved
   lipid productivity may be compromised, despite higher lipid content. To
   determine the optimal degree of nitrogen limitation for lipid
   productivity, batch cultures ofC. vulgariswere grown at different
   nitrate concentrations. The growth rate, lipid content, lipid
   productivity and biochemical and elemental composition of the cultures
   were monitored for 20 days. A starting nitrate concentration of 170 mg
   L-1provided the optimal tradeoff between biomass and lipid production
   under the experimental conditions. Volumetric lipid yield (in milligram
   lipid per liter algal culture) was more than double that under
   nitrogen-replete conditions. Interpolation of the data indicated that
   the highest volumetric lipid concentration and lipid productivity would
   occur at nitrate concentrations of 305 and 241 mg L-1, respectively.
   There was a strong correlation between the nitrogen content of the cells
   and the pigment, protein and lipid content, as well as biomass and lipid
   productivity. Knowledge of the relationships between cell nitrogen
   content, growth, and cell composition assists in the prediction of the
   nitrogen regime required for optimal productivity in batch or continuous
   culture. In addition to enhancing lipid productivity, nitrogen
   limitation improves the lipid profile for biodiesel production and
   reduces the requirement for nitrogen fertilizers, resulting in cost and
   energy savings and a reduction in the environmental burden of the
   process.

TI Estimating the potential of algal biodiesel to improve the environment
   and mitigate palm oil mill effluents in Malaysia.
SO Journal of Cleaner Production
VL 338
PY 2022
U1 1
U2 17
AB Although Malaysia produces palm biodiesel to boost renewable energy, the
   palm oil mills produce large quantities of palm oil mill effluent
   (POME), which emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Microalga could
   consume the POME and supply lipids for biodiesel. To investigate the
   economic feasibility of biodiesel made from microalgae, this study
   employs a partial equilibrium model of Malaysia's agricultural sector.
   The analysis hinges on the base scenario, whereas the algal farms use
   regular water, labour, fertiliser, and CO2from electric power plants as
   production inputs. For the second scenario, algal farms could blend POME
   into the algal ponds. Results indicate that algal farms' operating and
   capital costs are high, and they do not produce biodiesel until the
   biodiesel price reaches RM3.25 (or $US 0.78)/litre. The algal farms
   start producing 425.9 ML of algal biodiesel in 2024 that attain a peak
   in 2039 and starts declining. The alga farms using POME reduce their
   fertiliser costs; the algal farms increase biodiesel production slightly
   as algal farms utilise a fourth of the POME. Another interesting aspect
   of this research is algal biodiesel reduces greenhouse gases
   considerably by reducing tailpipe emissions from diesel engines, methane
   emissions by utilising POME, and CO2emissions from coal and natural gas
   electric power plants. Other countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand,
   could also benefit from this analysis and clean up their palm oil
   industry since they share a similar tropical climate.

AB Oleaginous microalgaChlorellais a promising microbial cell factory for
   producing lipids, transesterifiable to biodiesel, and phytochemical,
   high-value molecules (HVMs). To better understand the stress-induced
   oleaginous mechanism ofChlorellasp. FC2 IITG that closely matches
   withChlorella sorokinianabased on 18s rRNA gene sequence, we performed
   'Algomics' by systematically integrating metabolomics and proteomics
   data in response to time-resolved nitrogen-limitation: 40 h (mild), 88 h
   (moderate), and 120 h (severe). Ten HVMs belonging to four biological
   classes: triacylglycerol (TAG), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA),
   phytosterols, and terpenoids were annotated using untargeted
   metabolomics and MS/MS fragmentation pattern match to the spectral
   library. In particular, the study evidenced 4* and 6* increased
   accumulation of two different PUFA: 9(S)HpOTrE and
   dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, respectively, in nitrogen-limitation
   conditions. Co-extraction of TAG and PUFA could lower the biodiesel
   production cost for feasible commercialization. The investigation found
   a maximum accumulation of TAG 59:10 at 40 h, while that for TAG 54:4 was
   recorded at 88 h, which suggests different TAG species could be induced
   by regulating nitrogen-limitation severity. Elevated beta-oxidation,
   glycolysis, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle identified in proteomics
   analysis could provide the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate,
   and acetyl CoA, for different phytochemical accumulation in response to
   nitrogen limitation. The multiomics data unraveled a metabolic
   tug-of-war ongoing between biomass and storage lipid (TAG) accumulation
   during nitrogen-limitation, which involved multiple processes including
   hindered CO2fixation, the supply of energy, reductants, and carbon
   reallocation from proteins and membrane lipids. These findings provide
   distinct oleaginous mechanisms in non-model microalgae,Chlorellasp. FC2
   IITG, and engineerable targets for microalgal trait improvements.

AB Triacylglycerols of oleaginous algae are promising for production of
   food oils and biodiesel fuel. Airdrying of cells induces triacylglycerol
   accumulation in a freshwater green alga,Chlorella kessleri, therefore,
   it seems that dehydration, i.e., intracellular hyperosmosis, and/or
   nutrient-limitation are key stressors. We explored this possibility in
   liquid-culturingC. kesslericells. Strong hyperosmosis with 0.9 M
   sorbitol or 0.45 M NaCl for two days caused cells to increase the
   triacylglycerol content in total lipids from 1.5 to 48.5 and 75.3 mol%,
   respectively, on a fatty acid basis, whereas nutrient-limitation caused
   its accumulation to 41.4 mol%. Even weak hyperosmosis with 0.3 M
   sorbitol or 0.15 M NaCl, when nutrient-limitation was simultaneously
   imposed, induced triacylglycerol accumulation to 61.9 and 65.7 mol%,
   respectively. Furthermore, culturing in three-fold diluted seawater, the
   chemical composition of which resembled that of the medium for the
   combinatory stress, enabled the cells to accumulate triacylglycerol up
   to 24.7 weight% of dry cells in only three days. Consequently, it was
   found that hyperosmosis is a novel stressor for triacylglycerol
   accumulation, and that weak hyperosmosis, together with
   nutrient-limitation, exerts a strong stimulating effect on
   triacylglycerol accumulation. A similar combinatory stress would
   contribute to the triacylglycerol accumulation in air-driedC.

AB An attempt to scale-up a biodiesel production plant from a heterotrophic
   culture of microalgae, together with an evaluation of feasibility is
   performed in this article. The plant employs the microalgaeChlorella
   protothecoidesto obtain biomass. The subsequent oil extraction is done
   with supercritical carbon dioxide. Based on previous studies, it was
   possible to determine the mass and energy balances and to design the
   equipment of the main process. A non-conservative study reveals the no
   feasibility of the production plant unless the residues are sold (two
   different and real prices were chosen), providing with an investment
   recovery in both cases. On the other hand, the estimations from a
   conservative study, showed the non-viability of the process even if the
   residues are sold. This is mainly due to the big quantity of bioreactors
   required by the plant and the oil extraction yield. An alternative
   process with a complete extraction was also applied, which became viable
   in a conservative study only if the residues are sold at the highest
   price. All these results highlight the future potential of a plant with
   these characteristics in the current energetic context.

AB Microalgae are microorganisms able to accumulate considerable oils in
   biomass with appropriate fatty acids profiles for biodiesel production.
   Use of microalgae cultures is very attractive for this purpose because
   of their high lipids content, acceptable fatty acids composition, high
   photosynthetic efficiency and ability to grow at sustained moderate
   rates in water of different origin and composition. Nevertheless, these
   cultures have some limitations as maintaining and scale up problems and
   high operation cost for the production and harvesting of microalgal
   biomass. This paper presents a review of biodiesel production from
   microalgae culture as a bioenergy alternative to help to decrease the

AB An economic and environmentally friendly approach of overcoming the
   problem of fossil CO2emissions would be to reuse it through fixation
   into biomass. Carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the basis for the formation
   of complex sugars by green plants and microalgae through photosynthesis,
   has been shown to significantly increase the growth rates of certain
   microalgal species. Microalgae possess a greater capacity to fix
   CO2compared to C4plants. Selection of appropriate microalgal strains is
   based on the CO2fixation and tolerance capability together with lipid
   potential, both of which are a function of biomass productivity.
   Microalgae can be propagated in open raceway ponds or closed
   photobioreactors. Biological CO2fixation also depends on the tolerance
   of selected strains to high temperatures and the amount of CO2present in
   flue gas, together with SOxand NOx. Potential uses of microalgal biomass
   after sequestration could include biodiesel production, fodder for
   livestock, production of colorants and vitamins. This review summarizes
   commonly employed microalgal species as well as the physiological
   pathway involved in the biochemistry of CO2fixation. It also presents an
   outlook on microalgal propagation systems for CO2sequestration as well
   as a summary on the life cycle analysis of the process.

   with global warming and health problems. Production of biodiesel from
   microalgae may represent an attractive solution to the above mentioned
   problems, and can offer a renewable source of fuel with fewer
   pollutants. This review presents a compilation of engineering challenges
   related to microalgae as a source of biodiesel. Advantages and current
   limitations for biodiesel production are discussed; some aspects of
   algae cells biology, with emphasis on cell wall composition, as it
   represents a barrier for fatty acid extraction and lipid droplets are
   also presented. In addition, recent advances in the different stages of
   the manufacturing process are included, starting from the strain
   selection and finishing in the processing of fatty acids into biodiesel.

AB This study integrates electrochemical pretreatment with microalgae
   (Scenedesmus obliquus) treatment to enhance nitrogen and phosphorus
   removal and resource recovery from swine wastewater. By optimizing
   electrochemical and microalgae treatment conditions, the dilution factor
   and the hydraulic retention time for microalgae treatment were reduced
   to 5 times and 7 days, respectively. Under the optimized operational
   conditions, removal efficiencies of total nitrogen and ammonia could
   reach over 89% and 96%, respectively, and the removal efficiency of
   total phosphorus was over 99%. The study also found that aluminum was
   more suitable than iron for anode as it produced fewer residues.
   Additionally, the electrochemical pretreatment reduced Cu2+and
   Zn2+concentrations, mitigating negative impacts on microalgal growth.
   The microalgae biomass harvested from developed processes was rich in
   saturated fatty acids, which was desirable for biodiesel production.
   This approach addresses the challenges of nutrient removal for swine
   wastewater treatment with high quality biomass recovery.

AB We report here the successful combination of a two-step algal growth
   protocol, maximizing lipid yields with a single-step, and efficient
   extraction/transesterification procedure for the production of
   biodiesel. As a part of a global effort to find green renewable energy
   sources, our research focused on defining the optimal conditions for
   growing oil-rich microalgal biomass and its direct conversion to
   biodiesel. The influence of temperature, nutrient limitation and light
   intensity on biomass production was analyzed in three microalgal
   species:Chlorellasp.,Isochrysissp. andPhaeodactylum tricornutum. The
   temperature was found to dramatically affect the algal growth rates,
   reaching up to 2-3-fold higher rates on the "optimal combinations" than
   under initial conditions. The effects of temperature, light intensity
   and nutrient-deficient conditions on triglyceride levels in algal cells
   were measured by Nile red staining. InChlorellasp. andP. tricornutum,
   the highest lipid content was obtained at 20°C, under high and low light
   intensity, respectively, and inIsochrysissp. at 25°C and intermediate
   light intensity. A synergistic effect appeared only inChlorellasp.,
   where the lipid content reached 62% of the dry biomass. The three
   species were grown under the conditions we found optimal for oil yield.
   The dry biomass was converted directly into biodiesel without first
   extracting the lipid phase. The direct transesterification process was
   performed at 60°C using an SrO catalyst and MW radiation, yielding 99.5%
   conversion of lipids to biodiesel in 5 minutes.

AB Because of their photoautotrophic nature and ability to grow
   independently as isolated cells, photoautotrophic plant cell cultures
   have contributed, since their discovery, with important information
   about photosynthesis and the production of specific secondary
   metabolites. The reduction of oil deposits and the search for new energy
   sources to face this situation requires evaluating the potential of
   these photosynthetic systems for producing biodiesel and bioethanol as
   alternative systems to cyanobacteria. In this analytical review about
   the photoautotrophic plant cell cultures, the essential characteristics
   and the strategies employed for improving their growth in vitro are
   described making reference to the photoautotrophic cell systems obtained
   up to now and also establishing their actual and potential applications.
   From this analysis, it is evident the necessity of evaluating these cell
   cultures as alternative models for biofuel production.

AB In recent time, researchers are very much interested through worldwide
   to find out some alternative source of energy i.e. renewable energy in
   form of biofuels from cheaper raw materials by means of bioprocessing as
   well as biorefining to build up sustainable and green environment.
   Biorefining is sustainable biomass processing to obtain energy, biofuels
   and high value products through processes and equipment for biomass
   transformation. Biofuels are any solid, liquid or gaseous fuels that are
   derived from living plants or indirectly from agricultural, municipal,
   commercial or domestic wastes. First generation biofuel are derived from
   sugars, starch, vegetable oils or animal fats. Second generation
   biofuels are obtained from lignocellulosic biomass. Third generations
   biofuels are produced from algae. Algae as well as microalgae are
   classified as promising candidates in biorefinery processes because they
   are particularly important for obtaining multiple products. Moreover
   algae have recently gained attention as a potential feed stock for
   biofuels. Industrial reactors for algal culture are open ponds,
   photobioreactors and closed systems. Sea weeds are macro algae grown
   only in the sea and are a good source of phycocolloids. Phycocolloids
   are polysaccharides and considered as a good source of liquid fuel
   generation through fermentation. Microalgae appear to be the only source
   of renewable biofuel that is capable of meeting the global demand for
   transport fuels. This review paper clearly emphasized on the potential
   role of algae as well as microalgae to produce biofuels in form of
   biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-hydrogen and bimethane etc. via
   thermochemical and biochemical methods.

AB Optimization of the light conditions for biofuel production by the
   microalga Botryococcus braunii BOT-22 (race B) was performed using
   monochromatic red light. The lipid and sugar contents were approximately
   40% and 20-30% of the cell dry weight, respectively, and about half of
   the lipids were liquid hydrocarbons. The half-saturation intensities for
   the production rate of lipids, hydrocarbons, and sugars were 63, 49, and
   44 mol m-2 s-1, respectively. Fluorescence microscopic images of Nile
   Red-stained cells showed an increased number of intracellular neutral
   lipid granules due to increased light intensity. After 16 days of
   incubation in the dark, lipid and sugar, but not hydrocarbon content
   decreased. Growth, metabolite production, and photosynthesis were
   saturated at 100, 200 and 1000 mol m-2 s-1, respectively. These results
   indicate that photosynthetically captured energy is not used efficiently
   for metabolite production; thus, improvements in metabolic regulation
   may increase hydrocarbon production.

AB Microalgae are recognized as cell factories enriched with biochemicals
   suitable as feedstock for bio-energy, food, feed, pharmaceuticals, and
   nutraceuticals applications. The industrial application of microalgae is
   challenging due to hurdles associated with mass cultivation and biomass
   recovery. The scale-up production of microalgal biomass in freshwater is
   not a sustainable solution due to the projected increase of freshwater
   demands in the coming years. Microalgae cultivation in wastewater is
   encouraged in recent years for sustainable bioeconomy from biorefinery
   processes. Wastewater from the food industry is a less-toxic growth
   medium for microalgal biomass production. Traditional wastewater
   treatment and management processes are expensive; hence it is highly
   relevant to use low-cost wastewater treatment processes with revenue
   generation through different products. Microalgae are accepted as
   potential biocatalysts for the bioremediation of wastewater. Microalgae
   based purification of wastewater technology could be a universal
   alternative solution for the recovery of resources from wastewater for
   low-cost biomass feedstock for industry. This review highlights the
   importance of microalgal biomass production in food processing
   wastewater, their characteristics, and different microalgal cultivation
   methods, followed by nutrient absorption mechanisms. Towards the end of
   the review, different microalgae biomass harvesting processes with
   biorefinery products, and void gaps that tend to hinder the biomass
   production with future perspectives will be intended. Thus, the review
   could claim to be valuable for sustainable microalgae biomass production
   for eco-friendly bioproduct conversions.

AB This article is a brief and critical review of the state of the art in
   algae production in the food and energy industries. Review and
   experimental articles from the last five years were selected to
   recapitulate the reasons for interest in algae cultivation, for which we
   highlight the most valuable phytochemicals passing through their niches
   in the food market, their bioenergetic potential and the possible uses
   of algal waste biomass. In addition, we punctuate the advent of algae
   biorefineries. The objectives of this study were to list the main points
   related to interest in cultivation, drawing a parallel between the
   establishment of algae in the food market and its potential to establish
   itself in the energy market. It was concluded that the use of algae
   biorefineries has been used as a solution for the food, chemical and
   energy markets, despite the need for the development of broader research
   on industrial scale.

AB Microalgae has been identified as a potential feedstock for biodiesel
   production since its cultivation requires less cropland compared to
   conventional oil crops and the high growth rate of microalgae. Research
   on microalgae oils often are focused on microalgae oil extraction and
   biomass harvesting techniques. However, energy intensive and costly
   lipid extraction methods are the major obstacles hampering microalgae
   biodiesel commercialisation. Direct biodiesel synthesis avoids such
   problems as it combines lipid extraction techniques and
   transesterification into a single step. In this review, the potential of
   direct biodiesel synthesis from microalgae biomass was comprehensively
   analysed. The various species of microalgae commonly used as biodiesel
   feedstock was critically assessed, particularly on high lipid content
   species. The production of microalgae biodiesel via direct conversion
   from biomass was systematically discussed, covering major enhancements
   such as heterogeneous catalysts, the use of ultrasonic and microwave-
   techniques and supercritical alcohols that focus on the overall
   improvement of biodiesel production. In addition, this review
   illustrates the cultivation conditions for biomass growth and lipid
   productivity improvement, the available harvesting and lipid extraction
   technologies, as well as the key challenges and future prospect of
   microalgae biodiesel production. This review serves as a basis for
   future research on direct biodiesel synthesis from modified microalgae
   biomass to improve profitability of microalgae biodiesel.

   opportunities.

U1 6
U2 14
AB The environmental problems associated with the use of fossil fuels
   demand a transition to renewable sources for fuels and energy. A
   biorefinery approach has often been considered and microalgae as a
   feedstock has been pampered for its numerous possibilities to produce
   biofuels. Depending on the species and cultivation conditions,
   microalgae can produce fats, proteins and sugars. These raw materials
   can thus be utilized in the production of biofuels, bioenergy and
   biochemicals. For this reason, algal biofuels are considered as
   sustainable and renewable options for climate related challenges.
   However, there are many issues such as supply infrastructure, business
   and refinery opportunities, as well as their efficacy, tied to
   sustainable production of these energetic materials from algae. Thus,
   technical maturity, scalability, energy and material balance demands
   coupled with cost, nutrient resources demand, certification and
   legislation are needed to demonstrate the biorefinery opportunities of
   algal biomass valorisation. This paper therefore recommends that various
   consortiums tasked with algal biofuel projects should be chosen for a
   more holistic integrated multidisciplinary approach to address the
   advancement of algal biofuel technology.

AB Microalgae have long been considered an ideal potential feedstock for
   the production of biodiesel because of their fast growth rates, high
   productivities, and high intracellular lipid content. Conventional
   extraction methods generally utilize high pressures, halogenated organic
   solvents, dried algae, or long extraction periods, leading to high
   energy/capital costs to achieve acceptable microalgal lipid yields. For
   this reason, liquid CO2 has emerged as an innovative, greener extraction
   technique that offers the benefits of utilizing a lower pressure (150
   bar) and temperature (25°C), and lower energy/capital costs than
   supercritical CO2. However, obtaining complete access to the lipids
   contained in microalgal slurries continues to present a significant
   challenge. This study investigates mechanical and chemical cell
   disruption techniques, including ultrasonication, microwave radiation,
   grinding with liquid N2, osmotic shock, cooling, and freeze-drying,
   prior to the extraction of neutral lipids (NL) and free fatty acids
   (FFA) from Scenedesmus sp. slurries. The highest NL/FFA yield obtained
   was roughly 9.6 wt% when microwave radiation was applied, compared to a
   total NL/FFA yield of 13.2 wt% obtained by Soxhlet extraction.

   proteins, and glycolipids. These are suitable for the subsequent uses in
   cosmetic, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, biofuels, biological waste
   treatment, animal feed and food fields. In this regard, a special focus
   has been given in this review to describe the various methods used for
   extraction and purification of polysaccharides. The second part of the
   review provides an up-to-date and comprehensive summary of parameters
   affecting the microalgae growth and insights to maximize the metabolic
   output by understanding the intricacies of algal development and
   polysaccharides production. In the ultimate part, the health and
   nutraceutical claims associated with marine algal bioactive
   polysaccharides, explaining their noticeable potential for

AB The current burden on fossil-derived chemicals and fuels combined with
   the rapidly increasing global population has led to a crucial need to
   develop renewable and sustainable sources of chemicals and biofuels.
   Photoautotrophic microorganisms, including cyanobacteria and microalgae,
   have garnered a great deal of attention for their capability to produce
   these chemicals from carbon dioxide, mineralized water, and solar
   energy. While there have been substantial amounts of research directed
   at scaling-up production from these microorganisms, several factors have
   proven difficult to overcome, including high costs associated with
   cultivation, photobioreactor construction, and artificial lighting.
   Decreasing these costs will substantially increase the economic
   feasibility of these production processes. Thus, the purpose of this
   review is to describe various photobioreactor designs, and then provide
   an overview on lighting systems, mixing, gas transfer, and the
   hydrodynamics of bubbles. These factors must be considered when the goal
   of a production process is economic feasibility. Targets for improving
   microalgae and cyanobacteria cultivation media, including water
   reduction strategies will also be described. As fossil fuel reserves
   continue to be depleted and the world population continues to increase,
   it is imperative that renewable chemical and biofuel production
   processes be developed toward becoming economically feasible. Thus, it
   is essential that future research is directed toward improving these
   processes.

TI Advancement on mixed microalgal-bacterial cultivation systems for

PS 198-210
PY 2022
U1 10
U2 77
AB Biological wastewater treatment is a promising and environmentally
   friendly method that utilises living microorganisms to remediate water
   and enable recovery or conversion of contaminants into valuable
   products. For many decades, microalgae and cyanobacteria, photosynthetic
   living microorganisms, have been explored extensively for wastewater
   bioremediation. They can be used for recovering valuable nutrients such
   as nitrogen and phosphorous from secondary effluents and capable of
   transforming those nutrients into marketable products such as biofuels,
   biofertilisers, nutraceutical, and pigments for promoting a Bio-Circular
   Green economy. In recent years, there has been a shift towards mixing
   compatible microalgae with bacteria, which is inspired by their natural
   symbiotic relationships to increase nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries.
   With this enhanced bioremediation, recovery of polluted wastes can be
   intensified and higher biomass quality (with high nutrient density) can
   be achieved. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art of mixed
   microalgal-bacterial cultivating systems. A comprehensive comparison of
   existing studies that usedChlorellaspecies as microalgae in various
   mixed microalgal-bacterial cultivating systems (suspension, biofilm, and
   immobilisation) for nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries from wastewater
   is conducted. Key technical challenges such as balancing microalgae and
   bacteria species, pH regulation, light distribution, biomass harvesting,
   and biomass conversion are also discussed. From the data comparisons
   among different cultivation systems, it has been suggested that
   immobilisation appears to require less amount of operational light
   compared to the suspended and biofilm-based systems for similar nitrogen
   and phosphorus removal efficiencies.

AB Biodiesel is one of the best promising candidates in response to the
   energy crisis, since it has the capability to minimize most of the
   environmental problems. Microalgae, as the feedstock of third-generation
   biodiesel, are considered as one of the most sustainable resources.
   However, microalgae production for biodiesel feedstock on a large scale
   is still limited, because of the influences of lipid contents, biomass
   productivities, lipid extraction technologies, the water used in
   microalgae cultivation and processes of biomass harvesting. This paper
   firstly reviews the recent advances in microalgae cultivation and growth
   processes. Subsequently, current microalgae harvesting technologies are
   summarized and flocculation mechanisms are analyzed, while the
   characteristics that the ideal harvesting methods should have are
   summarized. This review also summarizes the environmental pollution
   control performances and the key challenges in future. The key
   suggestions and conclusions in the paper can offer a promising roadmap
   for the cost-effective biodiesel production.

AB Microalgae of the genus Chlorella are capable of accumulating lipids
   when exposed to nutrient limitation (especially nitrogen) and are
   therefore considered promising organisms for biodiesel production. This
   study explored the effects of nitrogen limitation on biomass,
   biochemical components and photosynthetic physiological parameters of C.
   vulgaris Beijierineck, an oleaginous microalga. Growth experiments were
   carried out in modified BG-11 medium with four different initial
   concentrations of sodium nitrate (18.0, 9.0, 4.5 and 3.6 mmol/L). These
   four nitrogen concentrations had no remarkable influence on growth, but
   exerted considerable influence on lipid accumulation in C. vulgaris.
   Maximum lipid content and productivity were obtained in the 4.5 mmol/L
   group (48.32% of dry weight and 0.0931 g.L-1.d-1, respectively), which
   increased significantly (P<0.05) compared with those of the 18.0 mmol/L
   group. The content of carbohydrate and soluble protein in the four
   groups decreased with increased lipid accumulation; however, in the low
   nitrogen groups (4.5 mmol/L and 3.6 mmol/L), the soluble protein
   degraded rapidly for carbohydrate synthesis at the initial stage, but
   the accumulated carbohydrate at the initial stage eventually converted
   to lipid at the later stage of cultivation. The maximum efficiency of
   light energy conversion of PS II (Fv/Fm), actual energy conversion
   efficiency (Yield), and relative electron transfer efficiency (ETR) all
   decreased significantly, and the change in F683/F718 suggested optical
   energy distribution and state transition between PS I and PS II. In
   addition, the initial and total Rubisco activity of C. vulgaris in the
   18.0 mmol/L and 9.0 mmol/L groups both peaked on the third day and then
   declined, while the Rubisco activity in the low nitrogen groups declined
   constantly. The ratio of initial and total Rubisco activity tended to
   decline at first and then increase. In conclusion, nitrogen limitation
   promoted lipid accumulation in C. vulgaris, and carbon distribution and
   photosynthetic physiology changed markedly.

AB The simplified direct-transesterification (DT) process was compared to
   the conventional biodiesel production process based on a reported
   previous experimental work with economic standpoint. Based on the
   process flow diagram, capital and operating costs were itemized properly
   and then unit biodiesel production cost was calculated. The results show
   the biodiesel production costs were 18.2 $ kg-1 (conventional process)
   and 12.5 $ kg-1 (DT process), respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows
   the source of biomass and chemical consumption are the major factors to
   determine total biodiesel production cost. The affecting factors were a
   solvent recycling, yield of biodiesel, and plant capacity and these
   values were varied to evaluate the variation of unit biodiesel
   production cost. As a result, the maximized biodiesel production cost
   went down to 3.5 $ kg-1, which is cost-competitive with other reported
   values of production cost.

AB Traditionally, the time of maximum biomass concentration in stage I is
   the widely adopted stage conversion time in two-stage microalgae
   culture. This study challenges this conventional approach, demonstrating
   that the optimal stage conversion time in stage I is 72 h rather than
   120 h for achieving maximum biomass concentration. A comparison of cell
   characteristics revealed that algal cells at 72 h exhibited better
   growth potential, leading to a higher biomass concentration after
   transfer to stage II and, consequently, increased lipid productivity.
   Moreover, the use of phosphorus repletion (5-fold) in stage II directed
   carbon flux toward biomass growth and lipid accumulation, thereby
   enhancing lipid productivity. By optimizing the stage conversion time
   and implementing phosphorus repletion, the mean lipid productivity of
   Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa cultured under autotrophy-nitrogen
   starvation and autotrophy-high light conditions increased by 31% and
   60%, respectively. This study underscores the importance of reevaluating
   the currently widely used stage conversion time.

AB Microalgae have been widely explored because of the diverse number of
   their worthwhile applications and potential as a source biomass for the
   production of biofuels and value-added materials. However, downstream
   techniques have yet to be fully developed to overcome techno-economic
   barriers. Flocculation is a superior method for harvesting microalgae
   from growth medium because of its harvesting efficiency, economic
   feasibility. Various kind of bio-flocculation harvesting methods are
   consider as attractive low cost and environmentally friendly options and
   able to harvest >90% biomass. Lipid recovery from microalgal cells is a
   major barrier for the biofuel industry because of process complexity and
   algae cell structure. Thus, the pretreatment method is necessary to
   disrupt the cell walls of microalgae and enhance lipid extraction. Many
   techniques, including dry methods of extraction, are already being
   implemented but found out that they are not efficient and
   cost-effective. Various new wet harvesting strategies have been claimed
   to extract major lipids in cost-efficient (30% less than conventional)
   way as wet technologies can eliminate the cost of cell drying and
   associated instruments. It is necessary to develop new methods which are
   energy and cost-effective, and environmentally friendlier for the
   commercialization of biofuels. Therefore, this review presents the
   advances in the progress of various flocculation harvesting methods with
   special emphasis on innovative bio-flocculation, the underlying
   mechanism of microalgae and flocculation. In this study also summarize
   the recent progress on microalgal oil extraction processes, and
   comparison was made between the processes in terms of sustainability,
   technology readiness, and applications in larger scales.

AB The world is experiencing an energy crisis and environmental issues due
   to the depletion of fossil fuels and the continuous increase in carbon
   dioxide concentrations. Microalgal biofuels are produced using sunlight,
   water, and simple salt minerals. Their high growth rate, photosynthesis,
   and carbon dioxide sequestration capacity make them one of the most
   important biorefinery platforms. Furthermore, microalgae's ability to
   alter their metabolism in response to environmental stresses to produce
   relatively high levels of high-value compounds makes them a promising
   alternative to fossil fuels. As a result, microalgae can significantly
   contribute to long-term solutions to critical global issues such as the
   energy crisis and climate change. The environmental benefits of algal
   biofuel have been demonstrated by significant reductions in carbon
   dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur oxide emissions. Microalgae-derived
   biomass has the potential to generate a wide range of commercially
   important high-value compounds, novel materials, and feedstock for a
   variety of industries, including cosmetics, food, and feed. This review
   evaluates the potential of using microalgal biomass to produce a variety
   of bioenergy carriers, including biodiesel from stored lipids, alcohols
   from reserved carbohydrate fermentation, and hydrogen, syngas, methane,
   biochar and bio-oils via anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, and
   gasification. Furthermore, the potential use of microalgal biomass in
   carbon sequestration routes as an atmospheric carbon removal approach is
   being evaluated. The cost of algal biofuel production is primarily
   determined by culturing (77%), harvesting (12%), and lipid extraction
   (7.9%). As a result, the choice of microalgal species and cultivation
   mode (autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic) are important factors
   in controlling biomass and bioenergy production, as well as fuel
   properties. The simultaneous production of microalgal biomass in
   agricultural, municipal, or industrial wastewater is a low-cost option
   that could significantly reduce economic and environmental costs while
   also providing a valuable remediation service. Microalgae have also been
   proposed as a viable candidate for carbon dioxide capture from the
   atmosphere or an industrial point source. Microalgae can sequester 1.3
   kg of carbon dioxide to produce 1 kg of biomass. Using potent microalgal
   strains in efficient design bioreactors for carbon dioxide sequestration
   is thus a challenge. Microalgae can theoretically use up to 9% of light
   energy to capture and convert 513 tons of carbon dioxide into 280 tons
   of dry biomass per hectare per year in open and closed cultures. Using
   an integrated microalgal bio-refinery to recover high-value-added
   products could reduce waste and create efficient biomass processing into
   bioenergy. To design an efficient atmospheric carbon removal system,
   algal biomass cultivation should be coupled with thermochemical
   technologies, such as pyrolysis.

   lights. The culture was transferred to a 500 L capacity portable pool
   under open conditions. This pond was used to further inoculate 3 more
   portable ponds. Physico-chemical and biotic growth parameters were
   monitored on a daily basis in the three ponds. The over reliance on
   fossil fuels will have a major impact on power supply in the near future
   if renewable sources of energy are not developed at a fast pace. The
   developed inoculum was subsequently used to inoculate an open raceway
   pond for large scale biomass production for biodiesel production.

AB Carbon dioxide storage in petroleum and other geological reservoirs is
   an economical option for long-term separation of this gas from the
   atmosphere. Other options include applications through conversion to
   valuable chemicals. Microalgae and plants perform direct fixation of
   carbon dioxide to biomass, which is then used as raw material for
   further microbial transformation (MT). The approach by microbial
   transformation can achieve reduction of carbon dioxide and production of
   biofuels. This review addresses the research and technological processes
   related to direct MT of carbon dioxide, factors affecting their
   efficiency in operation and the review of economic feasibility.
   Additionally, some commercial plants making utilization of CO2 around
   the globe are also summarized along with different value-added chemicals
   (methane, acetate, fatty acids and alcohols) as reported in literature.
   Further information is also provided for a better understanding of
   direct CO2 MT and its future prospects leading to a sustainable and
   clean environment.

AB The world is facing energy crisis and environmental issues due to the
   depletion of fossil fuels and increasing CO2concentration in the
   atmosphere. Growing microalgae can contribute to practical solutions for
   these global problems because they can harvest solar energy and capture
   CO2by converting it into biofuel using photosynthesis. Microalgae are
   robust organisms capable of rapid growth under a variety of conditions
   including in open ponds or closed photobioreactors. Their reduced
   biomass compounds can be used as the feedstock for mass production of a
   variety of biofuels. As another advantage, their ability to accumulate
   or secrete biofuels can be controlled by changing their growth
   conditions or metabolic engineering. This review is aimed to highlight
   different forms of biofuels produced by microalgae and the approaches
   taken to improve their biofuel productivity. The costs for
   industrial-scale production of algal biofuels in open ponds or closed
   photobioreactors are analyzed. Different strategies for photoproduction
   of hydrogen by the hydrogenase enzyme of green algae are discussed.
   Algae are also good sources of biodiesel since some species can make
   large quantities of lipids as their biomass. The lipid contents for some
   of the best oil-producing strains of algae in optimized growth
   conditions are reviewed. The potential of microalgae for producing
   petroleum related chemicals or ready-make fuels such as bioethanol,
   triterpenic hydrocarbons, isobutyraldehyde, isobutanol, and isoprene
   from their biomass are also presented.

AB Nannochloris atomus(QUCCCM31) is a local marine microalga showing
   potential to serve as renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. The
   investigation of the impact of temperature variation and nitrogen
   concentrations on the biomass and lipid productivities evidenced that
   biomass productivity increased with the temperature to reach an optimum
   of 195 mgL-1d-1at 30°C. Similarly, the lipid content was strongly
   influenced by the elevation of temperature; indeed, it increased up to
   ~3 folds when the temperature increased from 20 to 40°C. When both
   stresses were combined, triacylglycerols and lipid productivity reached
   a maximum of 45% and 88 mgL-1d-1, respectively at 40°C. Cultures under
   high temperatures along with Nitrogen-Depleted (ND) favored the
   synthesis of Fatty Acids Methyl Ester (FAMEs) suitable for high quality
   biodiesel production, whereas cultures conducted at low temperature
   coupled with Nitrogen-Limited (NL) led to a production of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Our results support the feasibility
   of cultivating the thermotolerant isolate QUCCCM31 year-round to meet
   the sustainability challenges of algal biomass production by growing
   under temperature and nitrogen variations. The presence of omega 3 and 9
   fatty acids as valuable co-products will help in reducing the total
   process cost via biorefinery.

AB Lipid extraction from microalgal biomass faces some challenges such as
   the selection of a suitable biomass type and its quality, lipid yield
   (LY), and process energy consumption. This study aimed to develop
   optimized processing conditions using response surface methodology, for
   the ultrasonic extraction (UE) of lipids from wet and dried marine
   Chlorella sp. Integrated process approaches with different extraction
   and solvent recovery steps were developed for the evaluation of the
   lipid recovery and process energy consumption. The effects of other
   processing factors, such as the biomass-to-solvent ratio, solvent type,
   and solvent-to-solvent ratio were investigated. The biomass and lipids
   extracted were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and gas
   chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) analysis,
   respectively. With a single extraction and single-solvent recovery (1-1
   cycle) process, the LYs from fresh and stored paste were 11.7% and 6%,
   respectively, while freeze-dried biomass produced an 18.5% LY. The
   energy consumption was 6000 MJ/kg lipid for the wet route and 8200 MJ/kg
   lipid for the dry route in the 1-1-cycle process. Dried biomass was
   selected for further investigation due to its longer storage-period
   capability and higher LY. The LY of the 2-1-cycle process using
   methanol/hexane (2/1 v/v) with a biomass-to-solvent ratio of 1/20 g/mL
   was 31% and was considered as a base case scenario of this study, which
   is 40.3% and 9.7% greater than those of the 1-1 cycle and 2-2 cycle,
   respectively. The lipids obtained from the 2-1 cycle at the optimum
   condition were mainly saturated fatty acids which are suitable for a
   biodiesel feedstock.

AB Currently, the scientific community is keenly working on
   environmental-friendly processes for the production of clean energy and
   sustainable development. The study was conducted to cultivate microalgae
   in raw institutional wastewater for water treatment, enriched production
   of biomass and CO2sequestration. The strains which were used in this
   study areScenedesmussp. andChlorellasp. which were isolated from Kallar
   Kahar Lake, Pakistan. Both strains were cultivated in synthetic growth
   medium (Bold's Basal Medium) to enhance biomass production. Afterward,
   microalgae cultures were inoculated in wastewater sample in mixotrophic
   mode under ambient conditions. The impurities in wastewater were
   successfully removed from the original sample by the 7th day of
   operation. COD 95%, nitrate 99.7% and phosphate 80.5% were removed by
   applyingScenedesmussp. Meanwhile,Chlorellasp. reduced 84.86% COD, 98.2%
   nitrate and 70% phosphate, respectively. Interestingly, sulfates were
   removed from wastewater completely by both strains. Besides being useful
   in wastewater remediation, these microalgae strains were subsequently
   harvested for lipid extraction and potential biofuel production was
   determined. Therefore, the applied method is an environmentally safe,
   cost-effective and alternative technology for wastewater treatment.
   Furthermore, the achieved biomass through this process can be used for
   the production of biofuels.

AB The application of ultrasound in biodiesel production has recently
   emerged as a novel technology. Ultrasound treatment enhances the mass
   transfer characteristics leading to the increased reaction rate with
   short reaction time and potentially reduces the production cost. In this
   review, application of ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production using
   acid, base and enzyme catalysts is presented. A critical assessment of
   the current status of ultrasound in biodiesel production was discussed
   with the emphasis on using ultrasound for efficient microalgae biodiesel
   production. The ultrasound in the biodiesel production enhances the
   emulsification of immiscible liquid reactant by microturbulence
   generated by cavitation bubbles. The major benefit of the
   ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production is a reduction in reaction
   time. Several different methods have been discussed to improve the
   biodiesel production. Overall, this review focuses on the current
   understanding of the application of ultrasound in biodiesel production
   from microalgae and to provide insights into future developments.

AB Fossil-fuel processing and consumption contaminates air, soil, and water
   resources through the release of hazardous chemicals. The harnessing of
   renewable energy resources and development of sustainable technologies
   have become prime targets of research and increased investment to
   protect the environment. The use of bio-based feedstocks in energy
   production provides a valuable pollution-curbing pathway with
   sustainability credentials, especially when wastewater is used to
   provide the nutrient requirements. The filamentous
   cyanobacteriumTrichormus variabilishas attracted substantial attention
   from researchers due to its potential for dual industrial functions in
   bioenergy production and bioremediation. This species can use the power
   of sunlight energy efficiently to fix atmospheric CO2and to generate
   valuable chemical compounds, such as carbohydrates and fatty acids,
   which can be converted to biofuels. As it grows in nutrient-rich
   wastewater (industrial effluent) it can serve as a bio-absorbant and
   replace costly chemical catalysts and nano-materials traditionally used
   for the removal of nutrients and metals. However, no recent review has
   presented the potential for state-of-the-artT. variabilis-driven
   phycoremediation-bioenergy production systems. This review suggests
   possible routes from phycoremediation to energy production as a strategy
   for developing the industrial application ofT. variabilis. It brings
   important research results on this species together and highlights major
   related challenges and opportunities. It explores the current status of
   the use of algae in bioremediation and the production of liquid and
   gaseous fuels utilizing wild-type and mutants ofT. variabilis. Finally,
   key points underlying the potential for future research on optimization
   of robust technologies for supplying sustainable bioenergy using this
   organism are presented.

AB Continuous exploitation of natural resources especially in fossil fuels
   to fulfil the market demand has jeopardized the natural resources in the

   for energy security and ecological sustainability. Yet, to date only a
   modest review has been reported on the bioethanol production technology
   from microalgae by using various pretreatment methods, fermentative
   microorganisms, fermentation processes, commercialization techniques and
   its environmental perspectives. This review paper aims to provide a
   comprehensive information by comparing the recent pretreatment
   technologies by using different types of ethanologenic microorganisms in
   various fermentation processes to maximize the bioethanol production.
   Studies of the economic viability and environmental perspectives of
   bioethanol from microalgae have been carried out to investigate its

AB Microalgae can synthesize and accumulate high neutral lipids under
   abiotic stress such as nutrient starvation or limitation. In the present
   study, an indigenous microalgaeChlorellasp. T4 was cultivated under both
   nitrogen (N)- and phosphorus (P)-limiting and N- and P-replete
   conditions to produce lipid and biodiesel consequently. Highest biomass
   productivity of 36.48  0.64 and 37.52  0.53 mg L-1d-1was obtained under
   N- and P-replete media, respectively, and relative expression ofrbcLgene
   was noted (p< 0.05). However, high lipid productivity of 15.54  0.27 mg
   L-1d-1and expression ofaccDgene were observed under N-limiting medium
   which was significantly higher than the control (BG-11) and other
   treatments (p< 0.05). Nutrient-limiting conditions produced fatty acid
   methyl ester that is suitable for biodiesel production compared to the
   nutrient sufficient medium. The variation in the expression of
   desaturase gene (KAS-1,omega-6 FAD, andomega-3 FAD) was triggered by
   different N and P treatments. These results would provide an insight
   into the physiological response and gene expression level under
   different nutrient levels, which could be harnessed for future genetic
   engineering ofChlorellasp. T4 for improved lipid production.

AB Microalgae have great potential as a feedstock for the production of a
   wide range of end-products under the broad concept of biorefinery. In an
   earlier work, we proposed a superstructure based optimization model to
   find the optimal processing pathway for the production of biodiesel from
   microalgal biomass, and identified several challenges with the focus
   being on utilizing lipids extracted microalgal biomass for economic and
   environmentally friendly production of useful energy products. In this
   paper, we expand the previous optimization framework by considering the
   processing of microalgae residue previously treated as wastes. We
   develop an expanded biorefinery superstructure model, based on which a
   mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed to
   determine the optimal/promising biorefinery configurations with
   different choices of objective functions. The MINLP model is solved in
   GAMS using a database built in Excel. Economic sensitivity analysis is
   performed to elaborate the potential improvements in the overall
   economics, and set the targets that must be achieved in the future in
   order for microalgal biofuels to become economically viable.

   important microalgae,Haematococcus pluvialisis the richest source of
   natural astaxanthin which is considered as "super anti-oxidant." Natural
   astaxanthin produced byH. pluvialishas significantly greater antioxidant
   capacity than the synthetic one. Astaxanthin has important applications
   in the nutraceuticals, cosmetics, food, and aquaculture industries. It
   is now evident that, astaxanthin can significantly reduce free radicals
   and oxidative stress and help human body maintain a healthy state. With
   extraordinary potency and increase in demand, astaxanthin is one of the
   high-value microalgal products of the future. This comprehensive review
   summarizes the most important aspects of the biology, biochemical
   composition, biosynthesis, and astaxanthin accumulation in the cells
   ofH. pluvialisand its wide range of applications for humans and animals.
   In this paper, important and recent developments ranging from
   cultivation, harvest and postharvest bio-processing technologies to
   metabolic control and genetic engineering are reviewed in detail,
   focusing on biomass and astaxanthin production from this
   biotechnologically important microalga. Simultaneously, critical
   bottlenecks and major challenges in commercial scale production; current
   and prospective global market ofH. pluvialisderived astaxanthin are also
   presented in a critical manner. A new biorefinery concept forH.
   pluvialishas been also suggested to guide toward economically
   sustainable approach for microalgae cultivation and processing. This
   report could serve as a useful guide to present current status of

U1 1
U2 39
AB High volumes of lipid extracted microalgal biomass residues (LMBRs) are
   expected to be produced upon commencement of biodiesel production on a
   large scale, thus necessitating its value addition for sustainable
   development. LMBRs of Chlorella variabilis and Lyngbya majuscula were
   employed to substitute the nitrogen content of recommended rate of
   fertilizer (RRF) for Zea mays L. The pot experiment comprised of 10
   treatments, i.e., T1 (No fertilizer); T2 (RRF-120 N: 60 P2O5: 40 K2O kg
   ha-1); T3 to T6-100, 75, 50, and 25% N through LMBR of the Chlorella
   sp., respectively; T7 to T10-100, 75, 50, and 25% N through LMBR of
   Lyngbya sp., respectively. It was found that all LMBR substitution
   treatments were at par to RRF with respect to grain yield production.
   T10 gave the highest grain yield (65.16 g plant-1), which was closely
   followed by that (63.48 g plant-1) under T5. T10 also recorded the
   highest phosphorus and potassium contents in grains. T4 was markedly
   superior over control in terms of dry matter accumulation (DMA) as well
   as carbohydrate content, which was ascribed to higher pigment content
   and photosynthetic activity in leaves. Even though considerably lower
   DMA was obtained in Lyngbya treatments, which might have been due to the
   presence of some toxic factors, no reduction in grain yield was
   apparent. The length of the tassel was significantly higher in either of
   the LMBRs at any substitution rates over RRF, except T6 and T7. The
   ascorbate peroxidase activity decreased with decreasing dose of
   Chlorella LMBR, while all the Lyngbya LMBR treatments recorded lower
   activity, which were at par with each other. Among the Chlorella
   treatments, only T5 recorded significantly higher values of glutathione
   reductase activity over RRF, while the rest were at par. There were
   significant increases in carbohydrate and crude fat, respectively, only
   in T4 and T3 over RRF, while no change was observed in crude protein due
   to LMBR treatments. Apparently, there was no detrimental effect on soil
   properties, suggesting that both the LMBRs can be employed to reduce the
   usage of chemical fertilizers, thus promoting maize crop production in a
   sustainable manner.

AB The need for renewable energy sources makes microalgae an essential
   feedstock for biofuels production. The molecular aspects and the
   response to nitrogen (N)-limited conditions with a phytohormone stimulus
   in microalgae have been slightly explored. In this work, Scenedesmus
   obliquus was used as a study model to analyze the effect of benzyl amino
   purine (BAP) and gibberellic acid (GA) coupled to nitrogen limitation on
   cell growth, biomass and fatty acids. The selected 10-5 M BAP increased
   the biomass by 1.44-fold, and 10-6 M GA by 1.35-fold. The total lipids
   also increased by 2.8 and 1.11-fold, respectively. The 10-5 M BAP and
   10-6 M GA addition to S. obliquus cultures at different initial nitrogen
   percentages (N-0, N-25, and N-50) showed a significant increase in cell
   growth and biomass productivity compared to the unstimulated cultures.
   BAP N-0 and GA N-0 produced the highest lipid yields with 55% and 50%,
   respectively. The lipid profile analysis revealed an increase,
   particularly in C18:1 and C16:0 fatty acids. Gene expression analysis
   showed an over-expression of acyl carrying protein (ACP), stearoyl-ACP
   desaturase (SAD), fatty acid acyl-ACP thioesterase (FATA), and
   diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) genes, which were mainly induced
   by nitrogen limitation. Furthermore, BAP and GA produced a significant
   over-expression on these genes in the N-replete cultures. This study
   shows that BAP and GA, coupled to N limitation stress, can be used to
   increase the biomass and lipid production in S. obliquus for sustainable
   biofuels.

   nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater and producing microalgal biomass
   as bioresources for biofuel or high-value by-products. There are three
   main sources of wastewater, municipal (domestic), agricultural and

   components in the wastewater, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are
   useful ingredients for microalgal cultures. In this review, the effects
   on the biomass and lipid production of microalgal Chlorella cultures
   using different kinds of wastewater were summarized. The use of the
   nutrients resource in wastewater for microalgal cultures was also
   reviewed. The effect of ammonium in wastewater on microalgal Chlorella
   growth was intensively discussed. In the end, limitations of

AB In this study, the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus supply on
   biodiesel production from Scenedesmus obliquus with glucose as the
   carbon source were investigated. It was found that sufficient phosphorus
   could further improve biodiesel production under nitrogen starvation. S.
   obliquus was cultivated in soybean processing wastewater. The removal
   efficiencies of carbon oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and
   total phosphorus (TP) after 8-day cultivation were 72%, 95%, and 54%,
   respectively. Moreover, the fatty acid productivity after eight-day
   cultivation reached as high as 99.3 mg.L-1.d-1, which was 1.15 times
   higher than the highest efficiency using a glucose culture. This result
   was due to two naturally-formed stages occurring with sufficient
   phosphorus: nitrogen sufficiency stage for biomass and nitrogen
   starvation stage for lipid accumulation. It verified the conclusion of
   the roles of nitrogen and phosphorus obtained in the glucose culture and
   provided an economic and environmentally friendly choice for biodiesel
   production with efficient soybean wastewater treatment.

AB Malaysian economy relies on palm oil industries as a driver for rural
   development. However, palm oil mill effluent (POME) that is generated
   from palm oil processing stages causes major environmental challenges.
   Before being released to the environment, POME treatment is crucial to
   comply with standard discharge limit. Microalgae have demonstrated
   excellent potential for phycoremediating POME and capturing CO2. In this
   study, local microalgae isolate such asChlamydomonassp. UKM 6
   andChlorellaspp. UKM 8 were used for POME treatment in 21 days with
   different inoculum sizes (5%, 10% and 15%). In addition, an integrated
   treatment process was performed by taking the treated POME supernatant
   for cultivation ofChorellaspp. UKM 2,Chorella sorokinianaUKM 3
   andChlorella vulgarisfor CO2sequestration study. Different
   CO2concentrations (5%, 10% and 15%) were used and the experiments were
   carried out in 10 days under continuous illumination. The results showed
   that among two species involves in POME treatment,Chlamydomonassp. UKM 6
   showed a great potential to remove pollutant such as COD (56%), nitrogen
   (65%) and phosphorus (34%). The biomass after POME treatment and
   CO2biofixation content high lipid (90 mg lipid/g biomass) which can be
   the potential source for biodiesel production. In CO2sequestration
   study,C. sorokininanaUKM3 able to takes up to 15% CO2with CO2uptake rate
   of 273 mgL-1d-1. In this study, the integrated system of POME treatment
   and CO2sequestration were feasible using microalgae.

AB The green algaBotryococcus brauniiis widely recognized as a source of
   non-fossil oil. However, limitations inBotryococcusbiomass production
   hamper its commercial exploitation. This study examines the effects of
   nutrients (nitrogen and iron) and environmental conditions (temperature,
   light intensity and photoperiod) on biomass and oil production in twoB.
   brauniiRace B strains, Kossou-4 and Overjuyo-3. The highest biomass and
   oil production were obtained at a nitrogen concentration of 750 mg l-1,
   iron concentration of 6 mg l-1, at 25°C and at 135 mol photons
   m-2s-1with a photoperiod of 16 h light:8 h darkness. Culturing the
   strains in Blue-green (BG11) medium containing optimized nutrients under
   optimal conditions resulted in an up to 10.6-fold increase in biomass.
   In Kossou-4 and Overjuyo-3 strains, biomass increased from 1.647 g 10
   l-1and 3.137 g 10 l-1respectively in normal BG11 medium to 17.390 g 10
   l-1and 21.721 g 10 l-1in optimized BG11 media and growth conditions.
   This was accompanied by 8-10.5-fold increase in oil production compared
   with that in normal BG11 medium. Oil (0.324 g 10 l-1and 0.211 g 10 l-1)
   was produced in normal BG11 medium in Kossou-4 and Overjuyo-3 strains
   respectively, compared with 2.642 g 10 l-1(Kossou-4) and 2.206 g 10
   l-1(Overjuyo-3) in modified BG11 media under optimized conditions.
   Therefore, optimization of nutrients and environmental conditions can
   increase biomass and oil production in the two strains ofB. braunii.

AB Here we comparatively assessed eight different microalgae for possible
   recycling and bioconversion of residual nutrients from hydroponic
   effluent (HE) into biochemical-rich microalgal biomass. Among the tested
   strains,S. obliquussp. 1 could take up nitrate, phosphate and ammonia up
   to 75.9, 80.8, and 66.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the nitrate,
   phosphate and ammonia uptake for other tested microalgae was in the
   range of 30.6-73.8%, 72.4-72.7%, and 6.6-54.6%, respectively. Further,
   the highest biomass production,Bx(g L-1), specific growth rate, &mu;
   (d-1), and photosynthetic efficiency, PE (mmol per photon m2), were
   observed forS. obliquussp. 1 (Bx= 1.42, &mu; = 0.21, and PE = 22.17)
   followed byChlorellasp. (B= 1.35, &mu; = 0.16, and PE = 16.08)
   andChlorella sorokiniana(B= 1.25, &mu; = 0.15, and PE = 15.99).
   Moreover, all the tested strains were found to be rich in major
   biomolecules including carbohydrates (5.76-10.49% TS), lipids
   (17.78-36.67% TS), and proteins (36.13-50.13% TS). The multivariant
   correlation analyses revealed that the bioconversion of nutrient-rich HE
   into biomass was positively correlated with the growth rate,
   photosynthetic efficiency, and biomolecule accumulation (p< 0.01).
   Overall, we conclude thatS. obliquussp. 1 may serve as a potential
   microalga for HE recycling and resource recovery leading towards a
   wastewater-based circular bioeconomy.

U2 274
AB Derivation of biofuel from microalgae biomass has been widely researched
   in the past few decades. Microalgae is capable of producing 58,700
   litres oil per hectare that can generate 121,104 litres biodiesel per
   hectare, which seemingly a promising transition over conventional fossil
   fuels. Nevertheless, economic sustainability of commercial scale
   production of microalgae biomass is still in shadows of doubt,
   especially the cultivation and harvesting process. Apparently, the
   microalgae cultivation system has evolved from traditional open pond to
   various modern photobioreactor (PBR) designs. However, with regards to
   tubular and flat panel PBRs as the most ubiquitous systems for biofuel
   production at commercial level, extensive discussion on reactor
   configurations and design betterment was presented in this review, along
   with precise technical comparison on cost and energy requirements for
   the cultivation systems. This review intended to serve as guideline for
   long term adoption of these well-established cultivation technologies in
   biofuel plants given the numerous economic benefits. Besides that, in
   attempt to lower the harvesting cost, potential use of various waste
   biomass as bioflocculants to recover microalgae biomass was introduced
   in this review. This article also deliberates direction on potential
   policy interventions to produce microalgae biofuel in a more sustainable
   and cost-effective manners in near future.

AB Nowadays algal biofuels are considered one of the most promising
   solutions of global energy crisis and climate change for the years to
   come. By manipulation of the culture conditions, many algal species can
   be induced to accumulate high concentrations of particular biomolecules
   and can be directed to the desired output for each fuel. In this
   context, the present study involved the assessment of the effects of CO2
   availability and nitrogen starvation on growth and chemical composition
   of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus subsalsus, testing a fast-growing
   native strain. The control experiments were performed with Conway
   culture medium in 12-day batch cultures, in 6-liter flasks and 12 h
   photoperiod, with addition of 2 L min-1 filtered air to each flask.
   Other two experimental conditions were also tested: (i) the placement
   into the cultures of additional dissolved nutrients except nitrogen, one
   week after the start of growth (N-), and (ii) the input of pure CO2 into
   the flasks from the 5th day of growth (C+). In all cultures, daily cell
   counts were done throughout the cultivation, as well as measurements of
   pH and cell biovolumes. Maximum cell yield were found in N-experiments,
   while cell yields of C+ and control were similar. Dissolved nitrogen was
   exhausted before the end of the experiments, but dissolved phosphorus
   was not totally consumed. Protein and chlorophyll-a concentrations
   decreased from the exponential to the stationary growth phase of all
   experiments, except for protein in the control. In all experiments,
   carbohydrate, lipid and total carotenoid increased from the exponential
   to the stationary growth phase, as an effect of nitrogen limitation.
   Increments in carbohydrate concentrations were remarkable, achieving
   more than 42% of the dry weight (dw), but concentrations of lipid were
   always lower than 13% dw. The addition of pure CO2 did not cause a
   significant increase in biomass of S. subsalsus nor generated more lipid
   and carbohydrate than the other treatments. Nitrogen starvation caused
   an intense accumulation of carbohydrate, but the increments of lipid
   were small. Despite the fast growth, the cyanobacterium S. subsalsus has
   a virtually null potential for biodiesel production, given its low lipid
   concentrations. The high concentrations of carbohydrate combined with
   fast growth point to the potential use of this species as raw material
   for other possible biotechnological processes, after a demonstration of
   technical and economic viability.

AB Biological methods of hydrogen production are preferable to chemical
   methods because of the possibility to use sunlight, CO2 and organic
   wastes as substrates for environmentally benign conversions, under
   moderate conditions. By combining different microorganisms with
   different capabilities, the individual strengths of each may be
   exploited and their weaknesses overcome. Mechanisms of bio-hydrogen
   production are described and strategies for their integration are
   discussed. Dual systems can be divided broadly into wholly light-driven
   systems (with microalgae/cyanobacteria as the 1st stage) and partially
   light-driven systems (with a dark, fermentative initial reaction).
   Review and evaluation of published data suggests that the latter type of
   system holds greater promise for industrial application. This is because
   the calculated land area required for a wholly light-driven dual system
   would be too large for either centralised (macro-) or decentralised
   (micro-) energy generation. The potential contribution to the hydrogen
   economy of partially light-driven dual systems is overviewed alongside
   that of other bio-fuels such as bio-methane and bio-ethanol.

AB The use of organic matter such as vegetable oil to produce biodiesel
   fuel has been a practical technology for a number of years. However, the
   search for new technologies and raw materials for biodiesel fuel
   production has gained increased attention recently because of financial
   and environmental concerns. Of particular interest are raw materials
   that are not food-related. Microalgae have gained a great deal of
   attention as a potential biodiesel raw material because of their high
   growth rates and ability to accumulate oil, bind carbon dioxide, and
   remove contaminants from wastewater. This article is a literature review
   of technologies for biodiesel production from microalgae. The
   technologies relate to microalgal cultivation, microalgal growth
   enhancement to simultaneously increase biomass and reduce pollution, the
   preparation of microalgal biomass for biodiesel production, and
   biodiesel production itself.

TI A review on biodiesel production using various heterogeneous

AB Due to food shortages and increasing fuel prices, scientists are trying
   to find suitable feedstocks for biodiesel production that do not divert
   food products to bioenergy. Although many edible oils may be cheaper
   feedstocks for biodiesel production, they may not be a sustainable
   source to meet this growing demand. This justifies the need to use
   non-edible oils, which can be a reliable sustainable oil source for
   biodiesel production. In this review paper, the effect of several
   factors was studied on biodiesel production, including different types
   of nanocatalysts, reusability of nanocatalysts, type of feedstock, and
   oil content in the feedstock. Also, the reaction mechanism of biodiesel
   generation using heterogeneous catalysts was thoroughly studied.
   Moreover, the physical properties of biodiesel produced by various
   nanocatalysts and its process flow diagram were investigated. The
   findings reveal that the use of low-cost nanocatalysts such as CaO
   instead of homogeneous catalysts can reduce the cost of biodiesel
   generation because the washing step in the biodiesel production process
   is eliminated. Also, several nanocatalysts like Li/ZnO-Fe3O4, CaO/MgO,
   SO4/Mg-Al-Fe3O4, nanocrystalline CaO, Sr-Al double oxides,
   SO4/Mg-Al-Fe3O4, CaO/Al/Fe3O4and nano-sulfated zirconia have shown
   significant biodiesel yields (above 98%). Moreover, non-edible oils like
   jojoba andSchizochytriumsp. microalgae can be used as suitable
   feedstocks for biodiesel production because they have a high oil content
   and are not used by humans. In general, nano-catalysts can be suitable
   alternatives to homogeneous catalysts due to their unique features such
   as high specific surface area, high reusability, high reactivity, high
   biodiesel yield, and environmentally friendly.

AB Microalgal carbohydrate is one of the major macromolecule metabolites,
   which has recently gained great attention as an alternative feedstock
   for wide-range sustainable biobased products. These biopolymers can act
   as a chemical platform for the production of biofuels through a
   biochemical conversion process. However, low microalgal carbohydrate
   productivity at a large-scale production has become a major problem for
   economical biofuel production. Several strategies have been proposed and
   the approach only increased carbohydrate content but reduced the
   microalgal biomass production, resulting in low microalgal carbohydrate
   productivity. Besides, the inappropriate pretreatments and fermentation
   approaches specifically with high-energy techniques could cause an
   increase in the cost of biofuel production. This present review gives a
   comprehensive discussion on microalgal carbohydrate enhancement
   strategies via cultivation techniques including the influence of
   environmental stress on the microalgal biomass and carbohydrate
   productivity. This paper also reviews the state of art on downstream
   processing of microalgal biomass prior to the hydrolysis and
   fermentation process. The different fine chemicals such as bioethanol,
   biobutanol, and biohydrogen production from microalgal carbohydrate are
   also discussed. The information from this review provides a framework
   for bioconversion of microalgal carbohydrate for biofuel and fine
   chemicals. This production could be beneficial for potential industrial
   implementation.

AB At present, the demand for fossil fuels is the global threatening
   picture. The fossil fuel is now widely accepted as unsustainable due to
   depleting resources and the accumulation of toxic greenhouse gases in
   the atmosphere, which exceeded the threshold level. To meet the
   inevitabilities, an alternative renewable source would be breathtaking
   for the rising demand. Renewable energy plays a critical role in
   addressing issues of energy security and climate change at global and
   national scales. To reduce the uses and to replace fossil fuel, the
   suitable alternate is biofuel. Microalgae are an attractive option for
   biodiesel production due to its rapid growth rate, rich source of
   lipids, and cheaper cultivation methods. Microalgal systems have the
   advantage as potential oil feedstock for the production of next
   generation fuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol, and biohydrogen. This
   review highlights the advantages of microalgae as suitable feedstock for
   biodiesel production; improved biomass production, their growth
   strategies, improvement of oil production, and genetic improvement are
   discussed.

AB Depleting energy sources result in a growing interest in the conversion
   of microalgal biofuel to improve economic feasibility. Efficient and
   cost effective biomass conversion to biofuel demands an increase of
   carbohydrates and lipid accumulation in algal cells. In the present
   study, it is measured that concomitant nitrogen, phosphorous and, iron
   deficiency induces significant physiological and biochemical changes in
   microalgaeOedogoniumsp.,Ulothrixsp.,Cladophorasp. andSpirogyrasp. by
   using Response surface methodology as the optimization of growth medium
   tool. In each of the studied algae species, nutrient deficiency reduced
   the growth rate of algae as well as protein and chlorophyll of
   individual cells. On other hand, the biochemical compounds such as
   carbohydrates were increased up to 0.58 mg/g inOedogoniumsp., 0.56 mg/g
   inUlothrixsp., 0.61 mg/g inCladophorasp., and 0.65 mg/g inSpirogyrasp.
   as compared to controls. The lipid increased by 75% inOedogoniumsp., 83%
   inUlothrixsp., 78% inCladophorasp., and 73% inSpirogyrasp. lipid content
   and fatty acid fractions of C16:0, C18:1 and C18:0 of algal species
   improve under nitrogen, phosphorus and iron deficiency that keeps the
   fuel properties (EN 14214, ASTM 6751 standard) in the acceptable range
   important to increase biodiesel quality. The results indicate that
   nutrient deficiency in algal biomass cultivation can enhance oil and
   carbohydrates and their subsequent biodiesel production on commercial
   scale.

AB Algae biodiesel is undeniably very promising as an energy substitute for
   fossil fuel. It mass cultivation though requires huge capital
   investment. The aim of this study was to find a simple, inexpensive and
   tolerable media for algae growth. The optimal growth conditions for
   algae growth were studied.Botryococcussp. was isolated from Sembrong Dam
   in Johor, Malaysia. In this study, two media were used, namely bold's
   basal medium (BBM) and synthetic media from nitrogen and phosphorus
   compound. The synthetic media consisted of ammonium chloride and
   monopotassium phosphate that were blended together and modified into
   desired ratios. The N: P ratio of 1.5:1 yielded the highest
   chlorophyll-a concentration and the optimal growth conditions of algae
   for both media were at 6000 Lux, pH 7 and 30 rpm. The BMM had the
   highest algae growth, 3.25*107cell/ml while the synthetic media yielded
   a maximum cell concentration of up to 1.025*107cell/ml which is 68.5%
   lower compared with BBM. The findings of this study point to the
   importance of large scale production of algae useful for industrial
   production of biodiesel.

AB A constant shift of society's dependence from petroleum-based energy
   resources towards renewable biomass-based has been the key to tackle the
   greenhouse gas emissions. Effective use of biomass feedstock,
   particularly lignocellulosic, has gained worldwide attention lately.
   Lignocellulosic biomass as a potent bioresource, however, cannot be a
   sustainable alternative if the production cost is too high and/or the
   availability is limited. Recycling the lignocellulosic biomass from
   various sources into value added products such as bio-oil, biochar or
   other biobased chemicals in a bio-refinery model is a sensible idea.
   Combination of integrated conversion techniques along with process
   integration is suggested as a sustainable approach. Introducing 'series
   concept' accompanying intermittent dark/photo fermentation with
   co-cultivation of microalgae is conceptualised. While the cost of
   downstream processing for a single type of feedstock would be high,
   combining different feedstocks and integrating them in a bio-refinery
   model would lessen the production cost and reduce CO2emission.

AB The goal of this study was to develop a self-settling microalgal
   consortium in raceway pond reactor (RPR). Experiments were carried out
   with cultures that developed without additional seeding, but naturally
   promoted by process conditions in a raceway pond reactor. The changes in
   microalgal communities and total biomass under nitrogen and phosphorous
   limitations were studied in both batch and continuous systems. At the
   steady state batch had the population of 46% Euglena sp., 16% Closterium
   sp., 14% Chlorella sp., 14% Scenedesmus sp. and 10% Ankistrodesmus sp.
   with a maximum biomass of 900 mg/L. In order to get self-settling
   microalgal consortium, the operation was changed to continuous mode with
   the aid of a specially designed settler for daily harvest and recycling
   of the biomass. Grazing fauna could be controlled by managing reduced
   liquid and solid retention time. At steady-state condition, an
   autoflocculating and self-settling consortium was developed which had
   mainly Fragilaria sp., Scenedesmus sp., and filamentous Ulothrix sp. The
   maximum biomass concentration obtained was 140 mg/L. The presence of
   neutral lipid droplets in the consortium was identified by staining with
   Nile Red. Development of the lipid rich consortium could be a suitable
   method for producing biofuel.

AB Microalgae feedstock production can be integrated with wastewater and
   industrial sources of carbon dioxide. This study reviews the literature
   on algae grown on wastewater and includes a preliminary analysis of
   algal production based on anaerobic digestion sludge centrate from the
   Howard F. Curren Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (HFC AWTP) in
   Tampa, Florida and secondary effluent from the City of Lakeland
   wastewater treatment facilities in Lakeland, Florida. It was
   demonstrated that a mixed culture of wild algae species could
   successfully be grown on wastewater nutrients and potentially scaled to
   commercial production. Algae have demonstrated the ability to naturally
   colonize low-nutrient effluent water in a wetland treatment system
   utilized by the City of Lakeland. The results from these experiments
   show that the algae grown in high strength wastewater from the HFC AWTP
   are light-limited when cultivated indoor since more than 50% of the
   outdoor illumination is attenuated in the greenhouse. An analysis was
   performed to determine the mass of algae that can be supported by the
   wastewater nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorous) available from
   the two Florida cities. The study was guided by the growth and
   productivity data obtained for algal growth in the photobioreactors in
   operation at the University of South Florida. In the analysis, nutrients
   and light are assumed to be limited, while CO2is abundantly available.
   There is some limitation on land, especially since the HFC AWTP is
   located at the Port of Tampa. The temperature range in Tampa is assumed
   to be suitable for algal growth year round. Assuming that the numerous
   technical challenges to achieving commercial-scale algal production can
   be met, the results presented suggest that an excess of 71 metric tons
   per hectare per year of algal biomass can be produced. Two energy
   production options were considered; liquid biofuels from feedstock with
   high lipid content, and biogas generation from anaerobic digestion of
   algae biomass. The total potential oil volume was determined to be
   approximately 337,500 gallons per year, which may result in the annual
   production of 270,000 gallons of biodiesel when 80% conversion
   efficiency is assumed. This production level would be able to sustain
   approximately 450 cars per year on average. Potential biogas production
   was estimated to be above 415,000 kg/yr, the equivalent of powering
   close to 500 homes for a year.

AB Phosphorus (P), in the form of phosphate derived from either inorganic
   (Pi) or organic (Po) forms is an essential macronutrient for all life. P
   undergoes a biogeochemical cycle within the environment, but
   anthropogenic redistribution through inefficient agricultural practice
   and inadequate nutrient recovery at wastewater treatment works have
   resulted in a sustained transfer of P from rock deposits to land and
   aquatic environments. Our present and near future supply of P is
   primarily mined from rock P reserves in a limited number of geographical
   regions. To help ensure that this resource is adequate for humanity's
   food security, an energy-efficient means of recovering P from waste and
   recycling it for agriculture is required. This will also help to address
   excess discharge to water bodies and the resulting eutrophication.
   Microalgae possess the advantage of polymeric inorganic polyphosphate
   (PolyP) storage which can potentially operate simultaneously with
   remediation of waste nitrogen and phosphorus streams and flue gases
   (CO2, SOx, and NOx). Having high productivity in photoautotrophic,
   mixotrophic or heterotrophic growth modes, they can be harnessed in
   wastewater remediation strategies for biofuel production either directly
   (biodiesel) or in conjunction with anaerobic digestion (biogas) or dark
   fermentation (biohydrogen). Regulation of algal P uptake, storage, and
   mobilization is intertwined with the cellular status of other
   macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen and sulphur) in addition to the
   manufacture of other storage products (e.g., carbohydrate and lipids) or
   macromolecules (e.g., cell wall). A greater understanding of controlling
   factors in this complex interaction is required to facilitate and
   improve P control, recovery, and reuse from waste streams. The best
   understood algal genetic model is Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in terms of
   utility and shared resources. It also displays mixotrophic growth and
   advantageously, species of this genus are often found growing in
   wastewater treatment plants. In this review, we focus primarily on the
   molecular and genetic aspects of PolyP production or turnover and place
   this knowledge in the context of wastewater remediation and highlight
   developments and challenges in this field.

AB Phosphorus stress was applied to enhance the lipid production
   inScenedesmussp. The highest lipid production (350 mg L-1) and lipid
   content (approximately 41.0% of dry weight) were obtained by addition of
   2 mg L-1NaH2PO4.2H2O every 2 days, which were higher than those in
   replete phosphorus. Correspondingly, carbohydrate content decreased
   significantly. We speculated that phosphorus limitation could block
   starch biosynthesis, and photosynthate flow tended to fatty acid
   biosynthesis to cope with stress. To investigate the mechanism that
   phosphorus stress triggers the carbon fixation to lipid biosynthesis,
   the transcriptome analysis was carried out by the Illumina RNA-seq
   platform. A total of 2897 genes were identified as differentially
   expressed genes. The observed overexpression of lipid production under
   phosphorus stress was bolstered by up-regulation of genes encoding for
   DGAT and pyruvate kinase, activation of carbohydrate metabolism pathway
   and fatty acid biosynthesis, and repression of carbohydrate
   synthesis-presumably to shunt the carbon flux toward TAG biosynthesis.
   The transcriptome will be useful to understand the lipid metabolism
   pathway and obtain the engineering economic algae species aimed at
   biodiesel production.

AB We report the cultivation ofChlorella sorokinianastr. SLA-04 in media
   containing trace amounts of Ca and Mg. The differences in productivities
   of biomass, lipids and carbohydrates were assessed relative to cultures
   grown in standard media (BG-11) that contain approximately 8* higher
   concentration of Ca and 30* higher concentration of Mg. Culture
   performance in N-limited standard media was also investigated. In
   addition to growth and accumulation of storage products (lipid and
   carbohydrate), we measured the utilization of N, Ca and Mg and monitored
   changes in cell size and photosynthetic activity. Our results showed
   that limitation of Ca or Mg did not inhibit cell replication and culture
   growth. On the contrary, Ca-limited (CaL) cultures had 30% higher
   biomass productivity relative to the control with excessive nutrients
   possibly due to improvement in cell wall flexibility and cell division.
   We also observed that CaLand Mg-limited (MgL) cultures had nearly 3-fold
   higher lipid concentration (measured as fatty acid methyl ester) and 50%
   higher carbohydrate concentration than the nutrient excess control
   cultures. Simultaneous culture growth and lipid accumulation in CaLand
   MgLcultures suggest thatde novosynthesis was the primary mechanism for
   lipid accumulation in Ca/Mg-limited media. Overall, our study
   demonstrates thatmicronutrient optimization, in addition to optimization
   of macronutrients, could significantly improve microalgal biorefinery
   yields.

AB Microalgae are promising candidate for biofuels as well as precursors
   for many high value products like polyunsaturated fatty acids, pigments
   or polysaccharides. Major cultivation of microalgae is carried out in
   open raceway ponds. Conventional raceway pond designs with paddle wheels
   have limitations such as high capital investment, inefficient mixing,
   lower depth (approximately 0.3 m) and lower productivity. In the present
   work, a modified high depth (1 m) raceway pond design with side entry
   axial flow impeller has been studied. The higher depth decreases the
   land requirement as well as capital cost. The pilot scale (4.5 m3)
   studies for cultivation ofSpirullinaplatensisin nutrient rich Zarrouk's
   culture media have shown productivity of 21.22 gm/m2/day compared to
   11.05 gm/m2/day in convectional raceway ponds. The specific power
   consumption was found to be 4 W/gm in modified design compared to 6 W/gm
   in conventional design. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis
   shows that modified design minimized the excessive turbulence generation
   and provided higher convective currents keeping biomass in suspension.
   The simulation results have been validated with ultrasonic velocity
   profiler (UVP) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements.

   essential topics such as carbon source selection, cultivation
   techniques, and accumulation enhancement strategies. Recently, various
   hosts including archaea, bacteria, cyanobacteria, yeast, and plants have
   been explored, stretching the limit of microbial PHA production. This
   review provides a comprehensive overview of current advancements in PHA
   bioproduction, spanning from the native to diversified cell factories.
   Recovery and purification techniques are discussed, and the current
   status of industrial applications is assessed as a critical milestone
   for startups. Ultimately, it concludes by addressing contemporary

AB In recent years, researchers have turned their attention to the
   co-cultivation of microalgae and plants as a means to enhance the growth
   of hydroponically cultivated plants while concurrently producing
   microalgal biomass. However, the techniques used require precise
   calibration based on plant growth responses and their interactions with
   the environment and cultivation conditions. This study initially focused
   on examining the impact of hydroponic nutrient concentrations on the
   growth of the microalgaChlorellasp. AARL G049. The findings revealed
   that hydroponic nutrient solutions with electrical conductivities (EC)
   of 450 S/cm and 900 S/cm elicited a positive response in microalgae
   growth, resulting in high-quality biomass characterized by an elevated
   lipid content and favorable properties for renewable biodiesel. The
   biomass also exhibited high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids
   (PUFAs), indicating excellent nutritional indices. The microalgae
   culture and microalgae-free culture, along with inoculation-free lettuce
   (Lactuca sativaL. var.longifolia) and lettuce that was inoculated with
   plant growth actinobacteria, specifically the actinomyceteStreptomyces
   thermocarboxydusS3, were subsequently integrated into a hydroponic
   deep-water culture system. The results indicated that several growth
   parameters of lettuce cultivated in treatments incorporating microalgae
   experienced a reduction of approximately 50% compared to treatments
   without microalgae, and lowering EC levels in the nutrient solution from
   900 S/cm to 450 S/cm resulted in a similar approximately 50% reduction
   in lettuce growth. Nevertheless, the adverse impacts of microalgae and
   nutrient stress were alleviated through the inoculation with
   actinomycetes. Even though the co-cultivation system leads to reduced
   lettuce growth, the system enables the production of high-value
   microalgal biomass with exceptional biodiesel fuel properties, including
   superior oxidative stability (>13 h), a commendable cetane number (>62),
   and a high heating value (>40 MJ/kg). This biomass, with its potential
   as a renewable biodiesel feedstock, has the capacity to augment the
   overall profitability of the process. Hence, the co-cultivation of
   microalgae and actinomycete-inoculated lettuce appears to be a viable
   approach not only for hydroponic lettuce cultivation but also for the
   generation of microalgal biomass with potential applications in
   renewable energy.

AB Biodiesel production from microalgae is a novel green technology
   designed to cope with fossil fuel depletion and climate change.
   Photobioreactors (PBRs) have been used to maintain optimum culture
   conditions for microalgae, including light, temperature, CO2, and
   nutrients, to produce a stable year-round biomass yield. To design a
   good PBR, the techniques of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been
   actively used to overcome limitations related to measurements and field
   experiments. In this study, a biomass production prediction grafting
   mixing and growth (BPMG) model was developed and used for quantitative
   comparison of the biomass productivity between different PBR designs by
   combining statistical analysis of hydrological particle movement using
   CFD and a microalgal growth model related to light intensity. A CFD
   model of a 20 L PBR was designed and validated using particle image
   velocimetry (PIV) under the same operating conditions. The vector fields
   showed applicable similarities between the measured PIV and the
   CFD-computed flow pattern, with 0.044 m s-1average error. The biomass
   productivity was calculated using the BPMG model with various PBR
   designs to consider practical improvements, such as bubble injection and
   internal baffles to guide fluid circulation. In the CFD computation, the
   maximum improvement was 88.0% for a plate PBR with eight uniform bubble
   injections and an internal baffle. Culture experiments withChlorella
   vulgariswere conducted to compare the performance of four cylinder and
   plate type PBRs before and after improvements. After modifying the PBR
   design, the cell concentration was improved by a maximum of 88.7% (59.4%
   to 144% during five successive culture experiments) using a modified
   plate PBR in comparison to a basic cylindrical PBR.

AB Background: Recent understanding that specific algae have high
   hydrocarbon production potential has attracted considerable
   attention.Botryococcus brauniiis a microalga with an extracellular
   hydrocarbon matrix, which makes it an appropriate green energy source.
   Results: This study focuses on extracting oil from the microalgae matrix
   rather than the cells, eliminating the need for an excessive electric
   field to create electro-permeabilization. In such a way, technical
   limitations due to high extraction energy and cost can be overcome.
   Here, nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) with 80 ns duration and
   20-65 kV/cm electric fields were applied. To understand the extraction
   mechanism, the structure of the algae was accurately studied under
   fluorescence microscope; extraction was quantified using image analysis;
   quality of extraction was examined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC);
   and the cell/matrix separation was observed real-time under a microscope
   during nsPEF application. Furthermore, optimization was carried out by
   screening values of electric fields, pulse repetition frequencies, and
   energy spent. Conclusions: The results offer a novel method applicable
   for fast and continues hydrocarbon extraction process at low energy
   cost.

AB The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of the new GreenDune
   photobioreactors for tertiary wastewater treatment, treated wastewater
   reuse and biomass application, using naturally occurring microalgae
   consortia. The study was conducted on a pilot installation in a
   wastewater treatment plant in Portugal and different operational
   conditions were tested. The system was capable to remove up to 95% of
   NH4+, the main pollutant in wastewater after secondary treatment using
   hydraulic retention times as low as 24 h. The application of a
   non-conservative scenario allowed the reuse of treated wastewater for
   seed production, and irrigation of naturally restricted use areas. The
   produced biomass was rich in proteins and carbohydrates with potential
   for biofuel production such as biogas or use as biofertilizers, closing
   the energy and nutrients cycle. Finally, the life cycle assessment of
   both the GreenDune and existing nitrification/denitrification systems
   were compared revealing that the operation of the GreenDune are more
   environmentally favourable than the existing system.

AB Microalgae is one the promising source of energy for the production of
   biofuel and other value-added products to replace the existing
   conventional fossil fuels. However, low lipid content and poor cell
   harvesting are the key challenges. Based on the growth conditions the
   lipid productivity will be affected. The current study examines the
   mixtures of both wastewater and NaCl on the microalgae growth was
   studied. The microalgae used for conducting the tests were Chlorella
   vulgaris microalgae. Mixtures of the wastewater was prepared under the
   different concentrations of the seawater, classified as S0%, S20%, and
   S40%. The growth of microalgae was studied in the presence of these
   mixtures, and the addition of Fe2O3 nanoparticles was included to
   stimulate the growth. The results showed that increasing the salinity in
   the wastewater resulted in decreased biomass production, but
   significantly increased lipid content compared to S0%. The highest lipid
   content was recorded at S40%N with 21.2%. The Highest lipid productivity
   was also witnessed for S40% with 45.6 mg/Ld. The cell diameter was also
   found to increase with increasing salinity content in the wastewater.
   The addition of Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the seawater was found to enhance
   the productivity of the microalgae extensively, resulting in 9.2% and
   6.15% increased lipid content and lipid productivity respectively
   compared to conventional cases. However, the inclusion of the
   nanoparticles slightly increased the zeta potential of microalgal
   colloids, with no noticeable effects on the cell diameter or bio-oil
   yields. Based on these findings, Chlorella vulgaris was identified as a
   suitable candidate for treating wastewater with high salinity exposure.

AB The use of microalgal biomass (MAB) for biofuel production has been
   recognized since long. Despite distinct advantages of algal biofuels,
   however, their sustainability and economic viability is still doubtful.
   Overall process cost and low energy recovery need to be significantly
   improved. The use of MAB, after extracting primary fuels in the form of
   hydrogen, methane, biodiesel and bioethanol, can be one promising route.
   This algal biomass, collectively termed as spent microalgal biomass
   (SMAB), contains even up to 70% of its initial energy level and also
   retains nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.
   Potential application routes include diet for animals and fish, the
   removal of heavy metals and dyes from wastewater, and the production of
   bioenergy (e.g., biofuels and electricity). Unlike whole algae biomass
   whose applications are relatively well documented, SMAB has been studied
   only to limited degree. Therefore, this work gives a brief overview of
   various ways of SMAB applications. An insight into current status,
   barriers and future prospects on SMAB research is provided. The
   feasibility of each application is evaluated on the basis of its energy
   recovery, economic viability, and future perspectives are provided.

AB In this review, we compare works from the current decade that address
   the CO2-removal from biogas by means of microalgae. The microalgae
   culture process acts as a biochemical absorption process; it is
   potentially competitive with respect to classical and commercial
   absorption methods due to its additional benefits such as availing CO2
   for the production of valuable microalgae biomass and being an
   environmentally friendly technique. Nevertheless, the low yield of
   biogas purification translates into the need to use optimal operation
   strategies that render the whole biogas production process economically
   feasible. A class of these strategies requires models capable of
   reproducing key traits of the dynamical behavior of microalgae growth.
   Thus, without overlooking the classical physico-chemical methods for
   biogas purification, our literature review addresses: (i) biogas
   purification via microalgae and different microalgae growth conditions,
   (ii) approaches that maximize microalgae growth, in order to increase
   CO2-consumption, and (iii) different models that describe the
   representative characteristics of microalgae growth. This investigation
   traces a pathway to future considerations on optimal biogas purification
   alternatives by microalgae culture processes.

   unique feature like high productivity, short duration and higher fatty
   acids content. However algal culturing for large-scale production is
   limited due to many technical and engineering challenges. One of the
   main constraints for large-scale biomass production is the
   non-availability of cost effective and affordable growth medium for open
   pond condition. In order to overcome this lacuna, the present study was
   carried out to find out the suitable cost effective growth medium using
   locally available resources. Farm Yard Manure an easily available
   organic waste yet, rich in nutrients and used for agriculture over the
   generations. FYM coupled with inorganic nitrogen source like urea was
   found to be better alternative to the synthetic growth medium, which may
   make wider acceptability at farmers' field for large-scale algal mass
   production. The present study reveals that FYM extract of 50%
   supplemented with 0.1% Urea was performing better for algal biomass
   growth in outdoor open pond condition.

AB Cultures under nitrogen limitation for Chlorella vulgaris were kept
   under different light quality (white, blue, yellow and violet) at 70 and
   140 E m-2 s-1; to evaluate the effect on fatty acids profiles and
   biodiesel quality. The results showed a maximum biomass and cell density
   at 140 E m-2 s-1 of: white light (0.69 g L-1 and 6.5*106 cells mL-1,
   respectively) and blue light (0.65 g L-1 and 8.0*106 cells mL-1,
   respectively); compared to violet and yellow light. The chlorophyll
   concentration (g mg-1 biomass dry weight) at 70 E m-2 s-1 were in the
   order of light: white (25.61) > violet (17.10) > yellow (11.68) > blue
   (11.40) and, at 140 E m-2 s-1 were: violet (23.64) > white (10.20) >
   yellow (9.66) > blue (7.99), suggesting the violet light stimulates the
   increase of chlorophyll a at higher intensity. The maximum lipid content
   (% w/w) were present under blue light (43.11), yellow (70.92) and violet
   (83.87) at 140 E m-2 s-1. The different wavelengths did not have a
   negative effect on the quality of the biodiesel, however; violet light
   presented greater productivity and the indicators such as CFPP were
   related to the oxidative stability value and low PUFA content, leading
   biodiesel to good oxidative stability.

U1 3
U2 70
AB Reasonable creation of renewable energy is being fervently debated. The
   biofuels, produced from food crops are restricted in their capacity to
   accomplish biofuel generation targets, mitigation of climate change and
   socio-economic development. These issues have exaggerated the curiosity
   in flourishing biofuels generated from non-food feedstocks like
   agricultural wastes, forest wastes, municipal wastes, and microalgae,
   which substantially offer golden opportunities in the longer run. The
   anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residues is the potential
   alternate of energy production (357.85 bcm biomethane) and has the
   capability of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) (979 Mt CO2eq. per
   year). This makes it a potential contributor to attain climate
   neutrality by 2050. However, the various physical, structural and
   compositional factors impeding the hydrolysis of agricultural residues
   in AD are to be eliminated. Conjoint application of biological
   pretreatment with other pretreatment approaches has proven to be more
   efficacious than applying individually. Furthermore, the well-planned
   policies are vital in making the AD technology adoption viable and
   successful. The policies regarding bioenergy production must make sure
   to supply food and feed items sustainably by the agricultural sector.
   This paper reviews the utilization of lignocellulosic agricultural
   wastes for biogas production, various aspects of biomethanation process
   like inhibitions and possible solutions for their alleviation,
   enhancement of biogas production, its environmental and techno-economic
   and policy aspects. Value addition of biodigested slurry by the
   production of industrial enzymes, vermicompost, fertilizer and mushroom
   cultivation, are also included in the paper.

U1 6
U2 87
AB Biogas is the gaseous by product generated from anaerobic digestion
   (AD), which is mainly composed of methane and CO2. Numerous independent
   studies have suggested that microalgae cultivation could achieve high
   efficiency for nutrient uptake or CO2 capture from AD, respectively.
   However, there is no comprehensive review on the purifying slurry from
   AD and simultaneously upgrading biogas via microalgal cultivation
   technology. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting and
   discussing an information integration system based on microalgal
   technology. Furthermore, the review elaborates the mechanisms,
   configurations, and influencing factors of integrated system and
   analyzes the possible challenges for practical engineering applications
   and provides some feasibility suggestions eventually. There is hope that
   this review will offer a worthwhile and practical guideline to
   researchers, authorities and potential stakeholders, to promote this
   industry for sustainable development.

AB With the rapid development of economy, the demand for petroleum in
   various countries is still on the rise, but as non-renewable energy, it
   is not good for sustainable development. In contrast, biodiesel emerges
   at the right moment and has developed to the third generation.
   Microalgae served as a leading role in the third generation of biodiesel
   has gradually become the energy raw materials with great development
   potential because of its advantages such as fast growth and
   non-occupation of arable land, etc. Therefore, it has become a research
   focus to utilize microalgae to product biodiesel in recent years. Since
   microalgae could be genetically modified easily, this paper reviewed the
   current situation and research advances of microalgae lipid metabolic
   pathway at home and abroad. The effect of gene modification methods at
   present on key enzyme in the pathway were discussed in order to find the
   effective and stable method for enhancing microalgae lipid metabolic
   pathway and to lay a theoretical foundation for further researches.

AB The rising energy demand of the world due to rapidly expanding
   population and accelerated industrialization is primarily satisfied by
   non-renewable fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are depleting at a faster rate
   and their overexploitation has raised serious environmental concerns
   which necessitate switching to alternative sustainable energy resources.
   Biodiesel has caught substantial interest as a viable and adaptable fuel
   substitute to the currently employed nonrenewable fuels due to its
   renewability, biodegradability and environmentally benign nature.
   Biodiesel can be derived from multiple sources by different production
   processes among which transesterification is the most widely exploited
   process. This article reviews different feedstocks for biodiesel
   production and strategies to improve lipid content in microalgae for
   enhanced biodiesel production. This review further describes biodiesel
   production methods, types of catalyst used in transesterification
   process, and assesses the recent critical challenges along with
   technical solutions for sustainable biodiesel production.

U2 95
AB Microalgae are regarded as a promising source of biodiesel. In contrast
   with conventional crops currently used to produce commercial biodiesel,
   microalgae can be cultivated on non-arable land, besides having a higher
   growth rate and productivity. However, microalgal biodiesel is not yet
   regarded as economically competitive, compared to fossil fuels and
   crop-based biodiesel; therefore, it is not commercially produced. This
   review provides an overall perspective on technologies with the
   potential to increase efficiency and reduce the general costs of
   biodiesel production from microalgae. Opportunities and challenges for
   large-scale production are discussed. We present the current scenario of
   Brazilian research in the field and show a successful case in the
   research and development of microalgal biodiesel in open ponds by
   Petrobras. This publicly held Brazilian corporation has been investing
   in research in this sector for over a decade.

AB The Brazilian environmental, economic, and social conditions for the
   long-term establishment of mass culture of microalgae for either biofuel
   production or greenhouse gases (GHG) abatement are described in detail.
   A brief historical introduction of the microalgal biotechnology is
   presented followed by a compilation of Brazilian published research
   works on microalgae, with special emphasis on microalgal Brazilian
   biodiversity and applied phycology. Several case studies on Brazilian
   microalgal biorefineries are presented with special emphasis on
   wastewater (WW) treatment. The manuscript also adds valuable new
   information about which regions of the country offer better growing
   conditions for dozens of endemic species. Favorable climatic and
   environmental conditions for the cultivation of several microalgae
   (green) and cyanobacteria species in specific regions of the country are
   suggested. Finally, based on realistic biomass productivities and
   product yields for the Brazilian context, several scenarios for biofuel
   production and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) abatement have been designed, and
   results are presented and critically discussed. Brazilian
   self-sufficiency on either fuels for transportation or GHG abatement
   using exclusively microalgae is quite challenging but achievable
   accordingly with the present state of the art.

AB Over the past decade, the number of original articles and reviews
   presenting microalgae as a promising feedstock for biodiesel has
   increased tremendously. Many improvements of microalgae have been
   achieved through selection and strain development for industrial
   applications. However, the large-scale production of lipids for
   commercialization is not yet realistic because the production is still
   much more expensive than that of agricultural products. This review
   summarizes recent research on the induction of lipid biosynthesis in
   microalgae and the various strategies of genetic and metabolic
   engineering for enhancing lipid production. Strain engineering targets
   are proposed based on these strategies. To address current limitations
   of strain engineering for lipid production, this review provides
   insights on recent engineering strategies based on molecular tools and
   methods, and also discusses further perspectives.

SO Energy Conversion and Management

U2 184
AB Biodiesel is considered as a potential substitute for petroleum-based
   diesel fuel owing to its comparable properties to diesel. Biodiesel is
   generally produced from renewable sources such as agricultural products
   and microalgae in the presence of a suitable catalyst. Recently ionic
   liquid (IL) catalyzed synthesis of biodiesel has become a promising
   pathway to an eco-friendly production route for biodiesel. This review
   focuses on the use of ILs both as solvents as well as catalysts for
   sustainable biodiesel production from agricultural feedstocks and
   microalgae with high free fatty acid content. Reactions catalyzed by ILs
   are known to render high reactivity under the mild condition and high
   selectivity of ester product with simple separation steps. The article
   first discusses the state of the art of biodiesel production using ILs
   along with the physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel.
   Then, current IL technologies were elucidated in terms of the categories
   such as acidic and basic ILs. The use of more advanced ILs such as
   supported ionic liquids and ionic liquid-enzyme catalysts on different
   biodiesel feedstocks were also discussed. Furthermore, the role of IL
   catalyst in intensified biodiesel production methods such as microwave
   and ultrasound technologies were also discussed. Finally, the prospects
   and challenges of IL catalyzed biodiesel production are discussed in
   this article. The review shows that ILs with bronsted acidity or
   basicity not only pose a low risk to the environment but also result in
   high biodiesel yields with mild reaction conditions in a short time.
   Bronsted acidic ILs can convert free fatty acids as well as
   triglycerides to biodiesel without the need for pretreatment, which
   facilitates in reducing the production cost of biodiesel. From the
   review, it can be concluded that ILs present great potential as
   catalysts for biodiesel production.

AB Recently, the increase in energy demand motivated the researchers to
   study renewable energy sources. A significant portion of energy is
   consumed in transportation. Biofuels such as biodiesel are significant
   renewable sources of energy that can be utilized in this sector. In
   Asian countries such as Iran, with widespread use of diesel engines,
   biodiesel engines are likely to be combined in the system without
   modifications, since they share similar functionalities with diesel
   engines. Biodiesels can be extracted from different feedstocks such as
   microalgae that can grow in Iran. To perform a thorough analysis of the
   development of biodiesel in Iran, this paper applied
   strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) structure to obtain suitable
   strategies. These strategies are ranked using a group decision-making
   method in fuzzy linguistic environment. Step-wise weight assessment
   ratio analysis (SWARA) is employed to weight the criteria, while fuzzy
   cognitive map (FCM) is utilized to consider casual relationships.
   Finally, weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) is utilized
   to rank the strategies. As indicated in the results, a necessity in
   third-generation biodiesel production from microalgae is support by
   government with subsidy and financial policies. Additionally, developing
   technologies and encouraging private sectors to invest in this area are
   important strategies as well.

AB Microalgae are sunlight-driven miniature factories that convert
   atmospheric CO2 to polar and neutral lipids which after esterification
   can be utilized as an alternative source of petroleum. Further, other
   metabolic products such as bioethanol and biohydrogen produced by algal
   cells are also being considered for the same purpose. Microalgae are
   more efficient than the conventional oleaginous plants in capturing
   solar energy as they have simpler cellular organization and high
   capacity to produce lipids even under nutritionally challenged and high
   salt concentrations. Commercially, microalgae are cultivated either in
   open pond systems or in closed photobioreactors. The photobioreactor
   systems including tubular bioreactors, plate reactors and bubble column
   reactors have their own advantages as they provide sterile conditions
   for growing algal biomass. Besides, other culture conditions such as
   light intensity, CO2 concentration, nutritional balance, etc, in closed
   reactors remain controlled. On the other hand, though the open ponds
   provide a cost-effective option to utilize natural light facility for
   algal cells, the tough maintenance of optimal and stable growth
   conditions makes it difficult to manage the economy of the process.
   Further, these systems are much more susceptible to contamination with
   unwanted microalgae and fungi, bacteria and protozoa that feed on algae.
   Recently, some work has been done to improve lipid production from algal
   biomass by implementing in silico and in vitro biochemical, genetic and
   metabolic engineering approaches. This article represents a
   comprehensive discussion about the potential of microalgae for the
   production of valuable lipid compounds that can be further used for
   biodiesel production.

AB Marine fouling caused major economic losses and has been a global
   challenge on environment protection. Currently, photocatalytic played an
   important role in dealing with sea pollution, enhancing the ability of
   resisting the bacteria and algae effectively. Rice straw biogas residue
   biochar with the natural in-situ nitrogen functional group has been
   widely utilized in the field of photocatalytic. The nitrogen functional
   group could effectively improve the photogenerated carrier transport
   rate. In addition, Cu2O as a typical photocatalyst could boost the
   photocatalytic ability, improving the performance of photocatalytic
   antifouling. In this work, the rice straw biogas residue biochar and
   Cu2O composited material (BRC) was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment
   and utilized in the field of photocatalytic and pollution removal. The
   natural nitrogen-containing lignocellulosic biochar was carbonized from
   rice straw biogas residue after anaerobic digestion and hydrothermal
   treatments. The BRC could impede the electron-hole complexation and
   continuously and efficiently generate reactive oxygen species (ROS),
   possessing an efficient photo-utilization rate. The BRC could exhibit
   excellent photocatalytic antifouling performance, with an antimicrobial
   rate of more than 95%, and Chlorella adhesion density reduced by 94%. In
   addition, BRC not only realized the resourceful utilization of
   agricultural waste, but also had a good prospect for the practical
   application of marine antifouling.

AB Aim: Effect of physiological stress, namely, nitrogen depletion,
   salinity and temperature on the biomass productivity and lipid
   productivity in Dunaliella sp. was investigated. Methodology: Culture
   conditions of Dunaliella sp. was optimized to maximise biomass
   productivity. Under this condition, it was subjected to two specific
   pattern of physiological stress, namely nitrogen depletion with
   increased salinity and increased salinity with temperature shock. The
   biomass and lipid productivities under these stress conditions were
   monitored. The extracted lipids were further characterized using gas
   chromatography-mass spectroscopy method. Results: Laboratory culture
   conditions for Dunaliella sp. were optimized to yield maximized biomass
   productivity. It exhibited doubling of lipid content under nitrogen
   limitation with high salinity, though overall biomass yield under this
   stress pattern had significantly decreased. Characterization of the
   accumulated lipids showed a significant increase in the unsaturated
   fatty acid production. However, a noticeable decrease in saturated fatty
   acid was observed under the stress pattern of high salinity followed by
   temperature shock. Interpretation: Algae biomass yield for Dunaliella
   sp. was maximum under laboratory conditions to which physiological
   stress was applied. It results in modulation of biomass and lipid
   productivity with a decrease in biomass and increase in lipid
   accumulation per unit dry biomass. Interestingly, it was found that such
   physiological perturbation in Dunaliella sp. result in modulation of
   lipid profile leading to increased accumulation of Omega 3 fatty acid.

U2 368
AB Microalgae as an environmentally friendly renewable feedstock can be
   processed into an array of products via conversion technologies such as
   algal lipid upgrading, liquefaction, pyrolysis, gasification, and
   bioethanol technology. As a unique chemical reaction, pyrolysis of
   microalgae yields useful chemicals like light olefins, alkanes, syngas,
   and biochar, as well as the bio-oils with less oxygen, more
   hydrocarbons, and higher gross heating values than the bio-oils derived
   from cellulosic biomass. The article reviews direct pyrolysis and
   catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae, pyrolytic products, reaction
   mechanisms, and upgrading of microalgal bio-oils. Based on critical
   analyses of the state-of-the-art developments in this field, the article
   provides the following perspectives. The current major bottleneck of
   microalgal technologies is still the productivity, which makes
   microalgae less abundant than cellulosic biomass at this stage.
   Biorefinery of microalgae shall be further developed to produce multiple
   products from various microalgal species. Determination of high
   value-added chemicals that can be produced from microalgae, especially
   from microalgal proteins, might significantly promote the development of
   the conversion technologies and related catalytic science. Designing
   novel catalysts for the selective conversion of microalgae into fine
   chemicals may increase the effective use of microalgae and the economics
   of the process. With the advancement of science and technology,
   catalytic pyrolysis technology has the potential to process microalgae
   into biofuels and fine chemicals.

AB The aim of this review is to discuss the use of microalgae as a feed
   ingredient in poultry nutrition. Microalgae are unicellular,
   photosynthetic aquatic plants. They are introduced to poultry diets
   mainly as a rich source of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   including docohexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid, but they can also
   serve as a protein, microelement, vitamin and antioxidants source, as
   well as a pigmentation agent for skin and egg yolks. The majority of
   experiments have shown that microalgae,
   mainlySpirulinaandChlorellasourced as a defatted biomass from biofuel
   production, can be successfully used as a feed ingredient in poultry
   nutrition. They can have beneficial effects on meat and egg
   quality,i.e.via an increased concentration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
   acids and carotenoids, and in regards to performance indices and immune
   function. Positive results were obtained when fresh microalgae biomass
   was used to replace antibiotic growth promoters in poultry diets. In
   conclusion, because of their chemical composition, microalgae can be
   efficiently used in poultry nutrition to enhance the pigmentation and
   nutritional value of meat and eggs, as well as partial replacement of
   conventional dietary protein sources.

AB Single Arthrospira strain was successfully used for synergistic
   bio-fixation of tail gas CO2 and digestate utilization generated from
   anaerobic fermentation project of dairy manure, establishing a new model
   of circular carbon bioeconomy. Digestate addition ratios (0.96-9.6 vol%)
   and frequency (once initially/in batches for 4 days) were investigated
   to improve Arthrospira growth rate, which maximizes at (0.58 g/L/d).
   Daily addition of digestate resulted in a higher biomass yield than
   addition once initially. Arthrospira biomass growth cultivated with 7.6
   vol% ozone-pretreated digestate and 92.4% zarrouk culture medium first
   increased to a peak at 0.90 g-O3/g-COD, and then decreased with further
   enhanced ozone concentration. The digestate is confirmed and designed be
   used for microalgae cultivation without pretreatment based on actual
   engineering cases. As far as heavy metals and protein content are
   concerned, it is safe to cultivate Arthrospira biomass in zarrouk
   culture medium with appropriate digestate addition for animal feed
   production.

AB Microalgae have reported to be one of the most promising feedstock for
   biofuel production. To obtain a comprehensive and systematic overview of
   the current state of microalgal research, particularly microalgal
   biofuel research, we retrieved and analyzed manuscripts and patents
   related to this topic and published between 1900 and mid-2015. We found
   that there was a burst in microalgal biofuel research from 2006 to 2011
   that significantly stimulated the development of microalgal
   biotechnology for the production of high value-added commodities and for
   environmental applications and microalgal mass culturing, in an attempt
   to make the entire process of biofuel production economically viable for
   industrialization. However, a lag in basic microalgal research has kept
   production costs high, resulting in a decline in investments, funding,
   and research efforts in the fields of microalgal biofuel production,
   microalgal biotechnology, and mass culturing since 2012. Based on a
   review of the challenges/problems of microalgae biofuel production and
   recent advances of their solution, the perspective view of the future
   R&D needs and trends were proposed. To bypass the price bottleneck of
   microalgae-based biofuel production, it has been proposed that
   energy-producing microalgal biotechnological applications be
   synergistically combined with microalgal biofuel production. Future
   investments and funding will most likely be directed toward basic
   studies that aim to elucidate the microorganisms' characteristics and
   toward the development of microalgal biotechnology and its environmental
   applications, which have potential economic and social benefits. This
   review represents a theoretical reference for both algal researchers and
   decision makers regarding the future directions of microalgal research,
   particularly that involving microalgal-based biofuel production.

AB Biomass is a plentiful renewable source of energy, food, feed and
   chemicals. It fixes about 1-2% of the solar energy received by the Earth
   through photosynthesis in both terrestrial and aquatic plants like
   macro- and microalgae. As fossil resources deplete, biomass appears a
   good complement and eventually a good substitute feedstock, but still
   needs the development of relatively new catalytic processes. For this
   purpose, catalytic transformations, whether alone or combined with
   thermal ones and separation operations, have been under study in recent
   years. Catalytic biorefineries are based on dehydration-hydrations,
   hydrogenations, oxidations, epimerizations, isomerizations, aldol
   condensations and other reactions to obtain a plethora of chemicals,
   including alcohols, ketones, furans and acids, as well as materials such
   as polycarbonates. Nevertheless, there is still a need for higher
   selectivity, stability, and regenerability of catalysts and of process
   intensification by a wise combination of operations, either in-series or
   combined (one-pot), to reach economic feasibility. Here we present a
   literature survey of the latest developments for obtaining value-added
   products using hexoses and pentoses derived from lignocellulosic
   material, as well as algae as a source of carbohydrates for subsequent
   transformations.

AB The commercial reality of bioactive compounds and oil production from
   microalgal species is constrained by the high cost of production.
   Downstream processing, which includes harvesting and extraction, can
   account for 70-80% of the total cost of production. Consequently, from
   an economic perspective extraction technologies need to be improved.
   Microalgal cells are difficult to disrupt due to polymers within their
   cell wall such as algaenan and sporopollenin. Consequently, solvents and
   disruption devices are required to obtain products of interest from
   within the cells. Conventional techniques used for cell disruption and
   extraction are expensive and are often hindered by low efficiencies.
   Microwave-assisted extraction offers a possibility for extraction of
   biochemical components including lipids, pigments, carbohydrates,
   vitamins and proteins, individually and as part of a biorefinery.
   Microwave technology has advanced since its use in the 1970s. It can cut
   down working times and result in higher yields and purity of products.
   In this review, the ability and challenges in using microwave technology
   are discussed for the extraction of bioactive products individually and
   as part of a biorefinery approach.

   this study, to achieve economical biodiesel production along with
   effective wastewater treatment at the same time, anaerobically treated
   brewery wastewater (ABWW) was utilized as a low-cost nutrient source, in
   the cultivation of Chlorella protothecoides. About 96 and 90% of total
   nitrogen and phosphorus in ABWW were removed, respectively, while C.
   protothecoides was accumulating 1.88 g L-1 of biomass. The C.
   protothecoides grown in ABWW showed increases in cell size and cell
   aggregation, resulting in a near 80% enhanced harvesting efficiency
   within 20 min, as compared with only 4% in BG-11. In addition, the total
   fatty acid content of the C. protothecoides grown in ABWW increased by
   1.84-fold (35.941.54% of its dry cell weight), relative to that of

AB Photosynthetic organisms rely on antenna systems to harvest and deliver
   energy from light to reaction centers. In fluctuating photic
   environments, regulation of light harvesting is critical for a
   photosynthetic organism's survival. Here, we describe the use of a suite
   of phycobilisome mutants to probe the consequences of antenna truncation
   in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Studies using
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), hyperspectral confocal
   fluorescence microscopy (HCFM), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS),
   and an optimized photobioreactor system have unraveled the adaptive
   strategies that cells employ to compensate for antenna reduction. As the
   phycobilisome antenna size decreased, changes in thylakoid morphology
   were more severe and physical segregation of the two photosystems
   increased. Repeating distances between thylakoid membranes measured by
   SANS were correlated with TEM data, and corresponded to the degree of
   phycobilisome truncation. Thylakoid membranes were found to have a high
   degree of structural flexibility, and changes in the membrane system
   upon illumination were rapid and reversible. Phycobilisome truncation in
   Synechocystis 6803 reduced the growth rate and lowered biomass
   accumulation. Together, these results lend a dynamic perspective to the
   intracellular membrane organization in cyanobacteria cells and suggest
   an adaptive mechanism that allows cells to adjust to altered light
   absorption capabilities, while highlighting the cell-wide implications
   of antenna truncation.

AB Microalgae are regarded as a potential biomass source for biofuel
   purposes. With regard to bioethanol production, microalgae seem to
   overcome traditional substrate drawbacks. Enzymatic activities are
   responsible for carbon allocation and hence for carbohydrate profiles.
   Enzyme activities may be manipulated by metabolic engineering; however,
   this goal may also be achieved by controlling environmental conditions
   of the culture system. We outline the key-enzymes as well as the main
   operational conditions applied to microalgae growth (inorganic nutrient
   supplementation, irradiance and temperature) that affect carbohydrate
   synthesis on microalgae and cyanobacteria. Normally, harsh conditions
   are needed for such a goal and thus, arrested microalgae growth may
   occur. Potential strategies to avoid arrested growth, while enhancing
   carbohydrate accumulation, were also pointed out in this review.

AB Microalgae is considered as a renewable and sustainable biomass to
   produce bioenergy and other high-value products. Besides, the
   cultivation of microalgae does not need any fertile land and it provides
   opportunities for climate change mitigation by sequestering atmospheric
   carbon-dioxide (CO2), facilitating nutrient recovery from wastewater and
   regulating industrial pollutions/emissions. Algal biomass harvested from
   different technologies are unique in their physio-chemical properties
   that require critical understanding prior to value-addition or bioenergy
   recovery. In this review, we elaborate the importance of cell wall
   weakening followed by pretreatment as a key process step and strategy to
   reduce the energy cost of converting algal biomass into bioenergy. From
   the energy-calculations, it was measured that the cell wall weakening
   significantly improves the net-energy ratio from 0.68 to 1.02. This
   approach could be integrated with any pre-treatment options, while it
   reduces the time of pre-treatment and costs of energy/chemicals required
   for hydrolysis of algal biomass.

AB Nannochloropsis species are esteemed for their capacity to produce
   lipids rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), crucial for various
   industrial applications. However, elucidating the precise influence of
   critical nutrient factors on Nannochloropsis tropism poses challenges
   due to species-specific variations. This study aims to unravel the
   kinetic behavior of Nannochloropsis sp. CCAP 211/78 under varied
   critical nutrient concentrations and their combinatorial effects in both
   phototrophic and mixotrophic cultivation modes to enhance EPA-rich lipid
   production. The kinetic parameters for lipid production were maximized
   under optimal cultivation conditions of 45 g/L salinity, an N/P ratio of
   25:1, and a nitrate concentration of 75 mg/L. Mixotrophic cultivation at
   20 g/L glucose induced maximum lipid accumulation due to oxidative
   stress, achieving lipid contents of 20.76  0.26% and 51.92  0.36% dry
   biomass in the early and late stationary phases, respectively.
   Combinatorial analysis of the optimized nutrients in phototrophic (OP)
   and mixotrophic (OM) modes of cultivation demonstrated synergy in
   enhancing overall lipid productivity. OP mode exhibited biomass
   productivity, lipid and EPA content of 166.71  4.82 mg L-1 d-1, 28.36 
   0.89% and 60.32  6.35 mg g-1 dry biomass, respectively, compared to
   116.69  2.24 mg L-1 d-1, 39.23  1.45% and 81.73  8.38 mg g-1 dry
   biomass, respectively, in OM mode. This research contributes to a
   comprehensive understanding of the interplay between critical nutrients
   and Nannochloropsis tropism, providing valuable insights for optimizing
   EPA-rich lipid production at different biorefinery scenarios.

AB Hydrolysis of lipids from microalgae under high water content was

   indicated that the hydrolysis process reduced the inhibition by water in
   FAME production; in addition, FAME obtained by esterification of
   hydrolysates was increased by 181.7% compared to FAME obtained by direct
   transesterification under the same amount of water content (80%). This
   method has great potential in terms of biodiesel production from
   microalgae since it uses no organic solvent, reduces the drying cost and
   lowers the operating cost compared to any other traditional method.

AB Sustainable and renewable energy resources are highly essential to
   replace the vanishing petroleum fossil fuels. Biofuels play a vital role
   in mitigating CO2emission, reducing global warming and bringing down the
   hike in oil prices. Biodiesel has become a recent attraction since it is
   biodegradable, renewable and non toxic. The objective of the paper is to
   study the potential of microalgae as an alternative raw material for
   biodiesel generation. Microalga has been chosen as a biodiesel producer
   due to high mass productivity and faster lipid production. Production of
   biodiesel from microalgae could be a greater alternative to oil crops
   due to economical instability, jeopardizing agricultural lands and
   insufficient oil crops. This review article focusses on the technical
   improvements in cultivation of different microalgal species, lipid
   content in various algal species, modes and efficiency of harvesting and
   transesterification methods. This paper thus serves the researchers to
   further enhance the production and commercialization of biodiesel.

AB Algal biofuels are far from a commercial reality due to the technical

   In this study, we investigated the effect of 4 different media and 5
   different nitrogen sources at 5 levels on the growth, biomass and lipid
   productivity of Scenedesmus sp. and Chlorella sp. The hypothesis was
   that a nitrogen source can be identified that provides enough stress to
   accumulate lipids without compromising significantly on biomass and
   lipid productivity. A maximum specific growth rate and doubling per day
   have been observed with algal species using modified BG-11 medium. Among
   the tested nitrogen sources, 2.5 mM potassium nitrate as a nitrogen
   constituent of modified BG-11 medium resulted in higher lipid content
   and productivity in the case of S. dimorphus (29.15%, 15.449 mg
   L-1day-1). Another noteworthy outcome of the present study lies in the
   usage of a smaller amount of the nitrogen source, i.e., 2.5 mM, which is
   found to be 7 times less than the standard BG11 media (17.60 mM sodium
   nitrate).

AB Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms like fish, crustaceans,
   mollusks, and aquatic plants, which has become a crucial source of
   protein and income. However, bacterial infections pose a significant
   challenge to the aquaculture industry and traditional treatments, such
   as antibiotics and chemicals, have limitations and environmental
   concerns. Disease prevention and control measures, such as the use of
   probiotics, vaccines, and biosecurity measures, are essential for the
   sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. Further research is
   also needed to develop more effective and sustainable strategies for the
   prevention and control of bacterial fish pathogens in aquaculture, where
   alternative treatments such as herbal extracts, essential oils, and
   probiotics require further investigation for efficacy and safety.
   Microalgae, particularly Chlorella, have potential applications in
   various industries such as biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and wastewater
   treatment. However, their large-scale production and commercialization
   face challenges. Safety of Chlorella to fish is a crucial issue that
   requires careful evaluation, with hematology being an essential tool to
   assess its effects on fish health and physiology. Studies show that
   Chlorella is safe for fish and does not have adverse effects on growth,
   survival, or immune system function. Chlorella is a safe and sustainable
   option for aquaculture, free from harmful chemicals and antibiotics. The
   Green Water System utilizes Chlorella as a natural filter and nutrient
   recycler, improving water quality and providing a well-balanced diet for
   aquatic animals. This eco-friendly approach also enhances fish immune
   systems, growth rates, and survival rates. The scientometric review
   shows significant research activity, with Chang JS being a prominent
   author and People's R China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences leading
   in contributions. The use of Chlorella shows promise as an alternative
   treatment for bacterial fish pathogens in aquaculture due to its
   antibacterial properties, safety, and sustainability. However,
   challenges such as cost-effectiveness and standardization need to be
   addressed for successful implementation in the aquaculture industry.

AB There is a pressing need to develop efficient and sustainable separation
   technologies to harvest algae for biofuel production. In this work, two
   bacterial species (Escherichia coli and Rhodococus sp.) were used as
   biocoagulants to harvest Chlorella zofingiensis and Scenedesmus
   dimorphus. The influences of UV irradiation and polyethylenimine
   (PEI)-coating on the algal harvesting efficiency were investigated.
   Results showed that the UV irradiation could slightly enhance
   bacteria-algae biocoagulation and algal harvesting efficiency. In
   contrast, the PEI-coated E. coli cells noticeably increased the
   harvesting efficiencies from 23% to 83% for S. dimorphus when compared
   to uncoated E. coli cells. Based on the soft-particle
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, an energy barrier
   existed between uncoated E. coli cells and algal cells, whereas the PEI
   coating on E. coli cells eliminated the energy barrier, thereby the
   biocoagulation was significantly improved. Overall, this work presented
   groundwork toward the potential use of bacterial biomass for algal
   harvesting from water.

AB Massive industrialization all over the globe is the main cause for the
   generation of huge quantity of wastes such as flue gas and wastewaters.
   Mindless release of these hazardous wastes into the environment is
   threatening the health and survival of the mankind. Judicious use of
   these wastes for microalgal biomass cultivation is recognized as a
   plausible approach for the creation of a renewable and sustainable
   process chain for biofuel production. This study was designed to
   cultivate microalgae utilizing the organic and inorganic nutrients from
   the industrial wastewater (IWW) and coal-fired flue gas (FG) for
   simultaneous waste bio-remediation and biomass production for
   biorefinery application in closed photobioreactors. The two microalgae,
   Chlorella sp. and Chlorococcum sp. were cultivated in industrial
   wastewater where varying concentrations of coal-fired FG from 1 to 10%
   CO2, volume/volume percent (v/v) was supplied to stimulate the
   mixotrophic growth. Performance of the two microalgae was evaluated in
   terms of nutrient removal (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and COD), CO2
   fixation, total lipid and carbohydrate content obtained in the
   integrated mode of process development. The IWW with flue gas (5% CO2
   (v/v)) resulted in maximum growth and CO2 fixation. The highest biomass
   growth (1.52 g L-1) and CO2 fixation (187.65 mg L-1 d-1) of Chlorella
   sp. with nutrient removal of >70% was observed by 5th day of batch
   cultivation. Nearly 90% removal of nitrogen resulted in nutrient
   limitation condition that steered the accumulation of lipid (17-34%) and
   carbohydrate (21.5-23.1%) in Chlorella and Chlorococcum sp. An overall
   1.7 fold improvement in biomass was observed in this process integration
   compared with control culture. The present study presents a green
   process for waste remediation, CO2 fixation and production of biomass
   rich in lipid & carbohydrate content for the development of a green
   microalgal biorefinery.

AB The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive study on algal
   biomass as feedstock for biogas production. Algae-derived biofuels are
   seen as one of the most promising solutions to mitigate climate change
   and as alternative to fast depleting of fossil fuels and oil reserves.
   Microalgae and macroalgae underwent an intense academic and industrial
   research, thanks to their capability to overcome the drawbacks related
   to the first and second generations of biomass resources. Major
   advantages of algae are: no competition with food crops for arable land,
   high growth rates, low fractions of lignin which reduces the need for
   energy-intensive pretreatment and compatibility with biorefinery
   approach implementation. However, some disadvantages such as the
   presence of high water content, seasonal chemical composition and the
   occurrence of inhibitory phenomena during anaerobic digestion, make
   algal biofuels not yet economically feasible although they are more
   environment friendly than fossil fuels.

AB The continued burning of fossil fuels since the beginning of the last
   century led to higher emissions of greenhouse gases and thus leads to
   global warming. Microalgae are one of the most important sources of
   green hydrocarbons because this type of algae has a high percentage of
   lipids and has rapid growth, consumes the carbon dioxide in large
   quantities. Besides, the cultivation of these types of algae does not
   require arable land. This review aims to explain the suitability of
   microalgae as a biofuel source depending on the fat content, morphology,
   and other parameters and their effect on the conversion processes of
   microalgae oil into biofuels by different zeolite catalytic reactions.
   It also discusses in detail the major chemical processes that convert
   microalgae oil to chemical products. This review sheds light on one of
   the most important groups of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris microalgae).
   This review includes a historical overview and a comprehensive
   description of the structure needed to develop this type of algae. The
   most important methods of production, their advantages and disadvantages
   are also deliberated in this work.

AB Economic and technological assessments have identified difficulties with
   the commercialization of bulk products from microalgae, like biofuels.
   To overcome these problems, a multi-product algal-based biorefinery has
   been proposed. This paper performs a techno-economic assessment of such
   a biorefinery. Four production pathways, ranging from a base case with
   commercial technologies to an improved case with innovative
   technologies, are analyzed. All region-specific parameters were adapted
   to Belgian conditions. Three scenarios result in techno-economically
   viable production plants. The most profitable scenario is the scenario
   which uses a specialized membrane for medium recycling and an open pond
   algae cultivation. Although the inclusion of a photobioreactor decreases
   the culture medium costs, the higher investment costs result in lower
   economic profits. The carotenoid content and price are identified as
   critical parameters. Furthermore, the economies of scale assumption for
   the photobioreactor is critical for the feasibility of this cultivation
   technology. The techno-economic assessment is an important methodology
   to guide and evaluate further improvements in research and shorten the
   time-to-market for innovative technologies in this field.

PS 629-636

U1 8
U2 254
AB Microalgal growth requires a substantial amount of chemical fertilizers.
   An alternative to the utilization of fertilizer is to apply biogas
   slurry produced through anaerobic digestion to cultivate microalgae for
   the production of biofuels. Plenty of studies have suggested that
   anaerobic digestate containing high nutrient contents is a potentially
   feasible nutrient source to culture microalgae. However, current
   literature indicates a lack of review available regarding microalgal
   cultivation with biogas slurry for the production of biofuels. To help
   fill this gap, this review highlights the integration of digestate
   nutrient management with microalgal production. It first unveils the
   current status of microalgal production, providing basic background to
   the topic. Subsequently, microalgal cultivation technologies using
   biogas slurry are discussed in detail. A scale-up scheme for
   simultaneous biogas upgrade and digestate application through microalgal
   cultivation is then proposed. Afterwards, several uncertainties that
   might affect this practice are explored. Finally, concluding remarks are
   put forward.

U1 2
U2 55
AB Microalgae are a potential source of biomass for the production of
   energy, which is why the amount of research on this topic has increased
   in recent years. This work describes the state of the art of microalgae
   production from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), its potential to
   generate electricity and the scale in which it is possible. The
   methodology used was a systematic review of the gasification of
   microalgae from 49 articles selected. Based on the review, a conceptual
   scenario for microgeneration in WWTP using as feedstock microalgae for
   thermal gasification was developed. The most consistent assumptions for
   a real scale microgeneration are microalgae production in open ponds
   using domestic sewage as a nutritional medium; the use of the
   flocculation process in process of harvesting; microalgae to energy
   through thermal gasification process using a downdraft gasifier.
   Considering a WWTP with a 3000 m3/d flux capacity, 860 kg/d of dry
   microalgae biomass might be produced. For which, gasification has a
   production potential of 0.167 kWh/m3 of treated sewage, but the energy
   balance is compromised by the drying process. However, when the biogas
   produced in anaerobic treatment enter in the model, it is possible to
   add a surplus of electricity of 0.14 kWh/m3 of treated sewage. Finally,
   a cost estimate is made for the acquisition of drying and
   gasification-electricity generation systems. For this scenario, the
   results suggest that the investments may be financially returned after
   five years, with additional potential for further optimization.

AB This study investigates the environmental improvements associated to the
   integration of a microalgae unit as a side-stream process within an
   existing municipal wastewater treatment facility in northern Italy.
   Microalgae are fed on the centrate from sludge dewatering, rich in
   nutrients, and on the CO2 in the flue-gas of the combined heat and power
   unit. The produced biomass is recirculated upflow the water line where
   it settles and undergoes anaerobic digestion generating extra biogas. A
   life cycle assessment was performed collecting primary data from an
   algal pilot-scale plant installed at the facility. Fifteen environmental
   indicators were evaluated. Compared to the baseline wastewater
   treatment, the new algal configuration allows an improvement for 7 out
   of 15 indicators mainly thanks to the electricity savings in the
   facility. Some recommendations are provided to improve the performance
   of the algal system in the scaling up.

   treatment. Among wastewaters tested, MFC fed with anaerobic digester
   effluent from rubber industry gave the maximum power density (55.43 
   1.08 W/m3) and simultaneously removed COD, nitrogen and phosphorus (by
   72.4  0.9%, 40.5  0.8% and 24.4  1.5%, respectively). 16S rRNA gene
   analysis revealed that dominant microbial communities were: Firmicutes
   (43.68%), Bacteroidetes (25.41%) and Chloroflexi (15.02%), which mostly
   contributed to bioelectricity generation. After optimizing organic
   loading rate, photosynthetic oleaginous microalgae were applied in
   cathodic chamber in order to increase oxygen availability, secondarily
   treat anodic chamber effluent and produce lipids as biodiesel
   feedstocks. Four MFCs with photosynthetic-cathodic chamber connected in
   vertical cascade could improve power density up to 116.9  15.5 W/m3,
   sequentially treat wastewater, and also produce microalgal biomass (465 
   10 g/m3) with high lipid content (38.17  0.01%). These strategies may
   greatly contribute to sustainable development of integrated bioenergy
   generation and environment.

AB Nutrient supply is important for maintaining a methanotroph and
   microalgae (MOB-MG) system for biogas valorization. However, there is a
   lack of understanding regarding how key elements regulate the growth of
   a MOB-MG coculture. In this study, a MOB-MG coculture with high protein
   content (0.47 g/g biomass) was established from waste activated sludge
   using synthetic biogas. An increase in iron availability substantially
   stimulated the specific growth rate (from 0.18 to 0.62 day-1) and biogas
   conversion rate (from 26.81 to 106.57 mg-C L-1day-1) of the coculture.
   Moreover, the protein content remained high (0.51 g/g biomass), and the
   total lipid content increased (from 0.09 to 0.14 g/g biomass). Nitrogen
   limitation apparently constrained the specific growth rate (from 0.64 to
   0.28 day-1) and largely reduced the protein content (from 0.51 to 0.31
   g/g biomass) of the coculture. Intriguingly, the lipid content remained
   unchanged after nitrogen was depleted. The eukaryotic community was
   consistently dominated by MG belonging toChlorella, while the
   populations of MOB shifted
   fromMethylococcus/MethylosinustoMethylocystisdue to iron and nitrogen
   amendment. In addition, diverse non-methanotrophic heterotrophs were
   present in the community. Their presence neither compromised the
   performance of the coculture system nor affected the protein content of
   the biomass. However, these heterotrophs may contribute to high carbon
   conversion efficiency by utilizing the dissolved organic carbon released
   by MOB and MG. Overall, the findings highlight the vital roles of iron
   and nitrogen in achieving efficient conversion of biogas, fast growth of
   cells, and optimal biomass composition in a MOB-MG coculture system.

U1 4
U2 56
AB A basic criterion in the selection of microalgae suitable as source of
   oil for biodiesel should be their actual capacity to produce lipids or,
   more properly, the fatty acid yield. Performance assessment of 10
   preselected microalgae under both batch and continuous culture points to
   the latter approach as the most adequate for evaluating fatty acid
   productivity. Differences were patent in continuous culture among
   strains that otherwise had analogous oil accumulation potential under
   batch culture. Some promising strains under batch culture (likeMuriella
   aurantiacaandMonoraphidium braunii) exhibited, however, values for
   actual fatty acid productivity lower than 40 mg L-1d-1in continuous
   regime. The analysis performed in photochemostat under continuous
   culture regime revealed the great potential ofChlorococcum
   olefaciens,Pseudokirchneriella subcapitataandScenedesmus almeriensisas
   oil producing microalgae. Fatty acid productivity levels over 90 mg
   L-1d-1were recorded for the latter strains under moderate nitrogen
   limitation, conditions which led to an enrichment in saturated and
   monounsaturated fatty acids, a more suitable profile as raw material for
   biodiesel. The continuous culture methodology employed represents a
   sound procedure for screening microalgae for biofuel production,
   providing a reliable evaluation of their fatty acid production capacity,
   under conditions close to those of outdoor production systems.

AB The aim of this review was to study why, despite large investments in
   research and development, algae biodiesel is still not price competitive
   with fossil fuels. Microalgal production was confirmed to be a critical
   cost item (84 up to 93%) for biodiesel regardless of the production
   technology. Techno-economic assessment revealed the main cost drivers
   during mass cultivation. It is argued that a breakthrough in the
   cultivation efficiency of microalgae is identified as a necessary
   condition for achieving price-competitive microalgal biodiesel. The key
   bottlenecks were identified as follows: (1) light and O2concentration
   management; (2) overnight respiratory loss of oil. It is concluded that
   most of the research on microalgae biodiesel yields economically
   over-optimistic presumptions because it has been based on laboratory
   scale experiments with a low level of interdisciplinary overlap.

AB Anaerobic digestion is a well-established technology for the sustainable
   production of biogas. However, to be used as a substitute for natural
   gas or as vehicle fuel, it is necessary to remove carbon dioxide (CO2)
   and other contaminants from biogas that can compromise the useful life
   of combustion engines. Upgraded biogas is known as biomethane (>95%
   methane content). This work reviews the different technologies used for
   upgrading biogas, emphasizing microalgae-nanoparticle systems,
   representing a more sustainable and environmentally friendly system.
   Parameters affecting these systems performance are discussed, and the
   trends and areas of opportunity for subsequent work are evaluated
   through a bibliometric analysis.

AB The adverse effects of fossil fuels on the environment and the rapid
   exhaustion of oil reserves are major concerns in the current global
   energy demand scenario. As a result, biofuels have emerged as promising
   alternate fuel due to their renewability, clean emissions and economic
   advantages over petroleum diesel. Biofuels are obtained from renewable
   sources such as vegetable oils, animal fat, microalgae, etc. Amongst
   these, waste cooking oil is considered to be an economical feedstock.
   This review focuses on different pretreatment methods for waste cooking
   oil and its lab-scale catalytic transesterification to biodiesel.
   Homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysts are compared based on
   reaction conditions, method employed and product yield. The purification
   steps, biodiesel properties and engine emissions profile are also

   study were illumination conditions between 50 and 200 mol m-2s-1,
   temperatures between 22 and 30°C, pH varying from 7 to 9, and with and
   without the use of buffers. Among the variables, growth temperature and
   buffering with TRICINE had a pronounced effect on the enhanced biomass
   production. With an illumination intensity of 150 mol m-2s-1at 24°C in
   the TRICINE-buffered Bold's Basal medium (pH 8.5) the maximum biomass
   concentration achieved was 1.76 gL-1. The specific growth rate of the
   microalga was found to be 1.28 d-1. Under these optimized conditions,
   the maximum lipid accumulation inScenedesmus obliquuswas found to be 33%
   (w/w). The compositional analysis of the neutral lipids indicated the
   predominance of palmitic acid and linoleic acid, accounting for 28% and

AB Although biodiesel has been extensively explored as an important
   renewable energy source, the raw materials-associated cost poses a
   serious challenge on its large-scale commercial production. The first
   and second generations of biodiesel are mainly produced from usable raw
   materials, e.g. edible oils, crops etc. Such a situation inevitably
   imposes higher demands on land and water usage, which in turn compromise
   future food and water supply. Obviously, there is an urgent need to
   explore alternative feedstock, e.g. microbial oils which can be produced
   by many types of microorganisms including microalgae, fungi and bacteria
   with the advantages of small footprint, high lipid content and efficient
   uptake of carbon dioxide. Therefore, this review offers a comprehensive
   picture of microbial oil-based technology for biodiesel production. The
   perspectives and directions forward are also outlined for future
   biodiesel production and commercialization.

AB It is estimated that by 2011, 20% of bioenergy needs of India should be
   met by biodiesel. To meet these expectations it would require 12 to 13
   million hectares of biodiesel feed stock plantations. Currently
   biodiesel is produced using non-edible oil from trees like Jatropha.
   This strategy of propagating jatropha as primary biodiesel feedstock has
   certain drawbacks. This paper addresses the shortcomings in the present
   strategy and suggests few alternatives. Farmers can be encouraged to
   grow short duration annual crops like castor, sweet sorghum which can be
   used to produce biodiesel and ethanol. Alternate plantation in wasteland
   with more oil yielding trees like Calophyllum inophyllum (undi) with
   50-73% oil, Diploknema (Aisandra) with 60% oil and Simarouba glauca
   [Quassia simarouba] (Lakshmi tharu) with 60-75% oil. In addition,
   Microalgae have much faster growth-rates than terrestrial crops. The per
   unit area yield of oil from algae is estimated to be from between 4.6 to
   18.4 l/m2 per year. There is a need to develop a holistic view of
   encouraging alternate multipurpose crop plantation strategies and
   methods of producing biofuels with out affecting the local ecology and
   farmer's needs of food, fodder and fuel wood for cooking.

AB Microalgae are a promising feedstock for biodiesel and other liquid
   fuels due to their fast growth rate, high lipid yields, and ability to
   grow in a broad range of environments. However, many microalgae achieve
   maximal lipid yields only under stress conditions hindering growth and
   providing compositions not ideal for biofuel applications. Metabolic
   engineering of algal fatty acid biosynthesis promises to create strains
   capable of economically producing fungible and sustainable biofuels. The
   algal fatty acid biosynthetic pathway has been deduced by homology to
   bacterial and plant systems, and much of our understanding is gleaned
   from basic studies in these systems. However, successful engineering of
   lipid metabolism in algae will necessitate a thorough characterization
   of the algal fatty acid synthase (FAS) including protein-protein
   interactions and regulation. This review describes recent efforts to
   engineer fatty acid biosynthesis toward optimizing microalgae as a
   biodiesel feedstock.

AB Marine microalgae offer a promising feedstock for biofuels and other
   valuable compounds for biorefining and carry immense potential to
   contribute to a clean energy and environment future. However, it is
   currently not economically feasible to use marine algae to produce
   biofuels, and the potential bioactive chemicals account for only a small
   market share. The production of algal biomass with multiple valuable
   chemicals is closely related to the algal species, cultivation
   conditions, culture systems, and production modes. Thus, higher
   requirements for screening of dominant algal strains, developing
   integrated technologies with the optimum culture conditions, efficient
   cultivation systems, and production modes to exploit algal biomass for
   biorefinery applications, are all needed. This review summarizes the
   screening of dominant microalgae, discusses the environmental conditions
   that may affect the growth, as well as the culture systems and
   production modes, and further emphasizes the valorization options of the
   algal biomass, which should help to offer a sustainable approach to run
   a profitable marine algae production system.

AB Microalgae are sunlight-driven green cell factories for the production
   of potential bioactive products and biofuels. Nannochloropsis represents
   a genus of marine microalgae with high photosynthetic efficiency and can
   convert carbon dioxide to storage lipids mainly in the form of
   triacylglycerols and to the omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
   acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Recently, Nannochloropsis has received
   ever-increasing interests of both research and public communities. This
   review aims to provide an overview of biology and biotechnological
   potential of Nannochloropsis, with the emphasis on lipid production. The
   path forward for the further exploration of Nannochloropsis for lipid
   production with respect to both challenges and opportunities is also
   discussed.

AB Microalgal biodiesel has emerged as an environment friendly alternative
   to the existing fossil fuels. The commercial production of this
   biodiesel is still challenging due to several technical and economic
   issues, which span from mass cultivation of microalgae to the biodiesel
   production. Mass cultivation is the most critical step in terms of water
   and nutrient requirement. Industrial wastewater such as textile
   wastewater (TWW) is a cheap source for water, which additionally
   contains necessary nutrients (phosphate, nitrates, micronutrients etc.)
   and organic dyes (potential carbon source) for algae cultivation. The
   application of microalgae for biodiesel production employing single
   objective strategy is not sustainable. Microalgae can be effectively
   employed to bioremediate TWW (dyes and nutrients removal) and to produce
   biodiesel from grown microalgae. This process integration
   (bioremediation-biodiesel production) can potentially improve biodiesel
   production and wastewater treatment. However, this process coupling
   needs to be thoroughly investigated to identify and optimize critical
   process factors (algal species, cultivation and harvesting methods,
   bioremediation mechanism etc.). This study has reviewed the status of
   TWW as potential source of water and nutrients, role of different algal
   species in the bioremediation of TWW, different cultivation systems,
   harvesting and biodiesel production methods. This review also suggests
   future research and development challenges for coupled textile
   wastewater treatment and microalgal biodiesel production.

AB Biodiesel from microalgae is a promising technology. Nutrient limitation
   and the addition of CO2are two strategies to increase lipid content in
   microalgae. There are two different types of nitrogen limitation,
   progressive and abrupt limitation. In this work, the simultaneous effect
   of initial nitrate concentration, addition of CO2, and nitrogen
   limitation on biomass, lipid, protein and carbohydrates accumulation
   were analyzed. An experimental design was established in which initial
   nitrogen concentration, culture time and CO2aeration as independent
   numerical variables with three levels were considered. Nitrogen
   limitation was taken into account as a categorical independent variable.
   For the experimental design, all the experiments were performed with
   progressive nitrogen limitation. The dependent response variables were
   biomass, lipid production, carbohydrates and proteins. Subsequently,
   comparison of both types of limitation i.e. progressive and abrupt
   limitation, was performed. Nitrogen limitation in a progressive mode
   exerted a greater effect on lipid accumulation. Culture time, nitrogen
   limitation and the interaction of initial nitrate concentration with
   nitrogen limitation had higher influences on lipids and biomass
   production. The highest lipid production and productivity were at 582 mg
   L-1(49.7% lipid, dry weight basis) and 41.5 mg L-1d-1, respectively;
   under the following conditions: 250 mg L-1of initial nitrate
   concentration, CO2supply of 4% (v/v), 12 d of culturing and 2 d in state
   of nitrogen starvation induced by progressive limitation. This work
   presents a novel way to perform simultaneous analysis of the effect of
   the initial concentration of nitrate, nitrogen limitation, and CO2supply
   on growth and lipid production ofNannochloropsis oculata, with the aim
   to produce potential biofuels feedstock.

AB Research findings of the past few decades on the cultivation of
   microalgae for biodiesel production from laboratory to pilot scale
   microalgal cultivation have translated into empirical hope of developing
   an eco-friendly biofuel from algae. As far as economic sustainability is
   concerned, harvesting of microalgae is one of the most energy extensive
   processes and thus a major challenge, being faced by this industry. In
   our study, we designed and developed a quaternary ammonium salt based
   cationic polymer and evaluated its effectiveness for freshwater
   microalgae harvesting. An
   epichlorohydrin-n,n-diisopropylamine-dimethylamine polymer with high
   viscosity (1040 cps) was synthesized. The flocculation performance of
   this polyamine polymer was evaluated in terms of biomass recovery
   efficiency of microalgae (Scenedesmus sp.), its effect on lipid yield
   and composition. The results revealed that due to high molecular weight,
   the biomass recovery efficiency of the polymer was achieved >90% at a
   very small dose of 8 mg/L whereas similar biomass recovery efficiency of
   chitosan and alum were achieved at 80 and 250 mg/L respectively. The
   presence of functional quaternary amine and hydroxyl groups played an
   important role in electric charge neutralization of microalgal cells,
   hence the improved microalgal flocculation performance in comparison to
   the natural flocculants but not affecting the lipid yield and its
   composition. The approximate cost of harvesting 1 kg of Scenedesmus
   biomass is approximately 0.5 USD for the polyamine polymer whereas 50
   USD for chitosan. Therefore, polymer based harvesting of microalgae for
   low valued products such as biodiesel, polyamine based polymers would be
   preferred over the natural polymer.

   obtained for Scenedesmus obliquus at 1.5 A, initial pH 9 and 6 g L-1
   NaCl with power consumption of 3.84 kWh kg-1. Recovery efficiency of ECH
   process was comparable to literature reported centrifugation, filtration
   and chemical flocculation techniques but with a much lower power
   consumption. The ECH process with addition of electrolyte enhanced the
   lipid extraction by 22% without any adverse effects. The ECH process
   with non sacrificial carbon electrodes could be a possible harvesting
   step at commercial scale microalgal biomass production.

AB This article evaluates the sustainability and economic potential of
   microalgae grown in brewery wastewater for biodiesel and biomass
   production. Three sustainability and two economic indicators were
   considered in the evaluation within a life cycle perspective. For the
   production system the most efficient process units were selected.
   Results show that harvesting and oil separation are the main process
   bottlenecks. Microalgae with higher lipid content and productivity are
   desirable for biodiesel production, although comparable to other
   biofuel's feedstock concerning sustainability. However, improvements are
   still needed to reach the performance level of fossil diesel.
   Profitability reaches a limit for larger cultivation areas, being higher
   when extracted biomass is sold together with microalgae oil, in which
   case the influence of lipid content and areal productivity is smaller.
   The values of oil and/or biomass prices calculated to ensure that the
   process is economically sound are still very high compared with other
   fuel options, especially biodiesel.

AB In the present economy, difficulties to access energy sources are real
   drawbacks to maintain our current lifestyle. In fact, increasing
   interests have been gathered around efficient strategies to use energy
   sources that do not generate high CO2titers. Thus, science-funding
   agencies have invested more resources into research on hydrogen among
   other biofuels as interesting energy vectors. This article reviews
   present energy challenges and frames it into the present fuel usage
   landscape. Different strategies for hydrogen production are explained
   and evaluated. Focus is on biological hydrogen production; fermentation
   and photon-fuelled hydrogen production are compared. Mathematical models
   in biology can be used to assess, explore and design production
   strategies for industrially relevant metabolites, such as biofuels. We
   assess the diverse construction and uses of genome-scale metabolic
   models of cyanobacteriumSynechocystissp. PCC6803 to efficiently obtain
   biofuels. This organism has been studied as a potential photon-fuelled
   production platform for its ability to grow from carbon dioxide, water
   and photons, on simple culture media. Finally, we review studies that
   propose production strategies to weigh this organism's viability as a
   biofuel production platform. Overall, the work presented in this review
   unveils the industrial capabilities of cyanobacteriumSynechocystissp.
   PCC6803 to evolve interesting metabolites as a clean biofuel production

AB The detailed knowledge already available about cellulose synthases and
   their regulation, plus emerging insights into the process of cellulose
   secretion in cyanobacteria make cellulose an attractive polymer for the
   application of the photanol concept in an economically viable production
   process. By varying the total complement of antenna pigments, the
   penetration depth of sunlight into a photo-bioreactor, and thereby the
   relative fraction of photosynthetically productive cells in it, can be
   increased. One way to circumvent downstream processing problems is to
   synthesize a volatile or insoluble product, allowing phase separation.
   Another way out of the high costs of product recovery from dilute
   solutions may be found in the coupling of processes, so that the dilute
   solar biofuel product is converted by a high-affinity biological process
   into a secondary product in a (photo) chemical conversion in which
   product separation can be based on phase separation.

TI Advanced nanomaterials and metal-organic frameworks for catalytic
   bio-diesel production from microalgal lipids - a review.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 349
PY 2024
U1 3
U2 25
AB Increasing energy demands require exploring renewable, eco-friendly
   (green), and cost-effective energy resources. Among various sources of
   biodiesel, microalgal lipids are an excellent resource, owing to their
   high abundance in microalgal biomass. Transesterification catalyzed by
   advanced materials, especially nanomaterials and metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs), is a revolutionary process for overcoming the energy
   crisis. This review elaborates on the conversion of microalgal lipids
   (including genetically modified algae) into biodiesel while primarily
   focusing on the transesterification of lipids into biodiesel by
   employing catalysts based on above mentioned advanced materials.
   Furthermore, current challenges faced by this process for industrial
   scale upgradation are presented with future perspectives and concluding
   remarks. These materials offer higher conversion (>90%) of microalgae
   into biodiesel. Nanocatalytic processes, lack the need for higher
   pressure and temperature, which simplifies the overall process for
   industrial-scale application. Green biodiesel production from microalgae
   offers better fuel than fossil fuels in terms of performance, quality,
   and less environmental harm. The chemical and thermal stability of
   advanced materials (particularly MOFs) is the main benefit of the blue
   recycling of catalysts. Advanced materials-based catalysts are reported
   to reduce the risk of biodiesel contamination. While purity of glycerin
   as side product makes it useful skin-related product. However, these
   aspects should still be controlled in future studies. Further studies
   should relate to additional aspects of green production, including waste
   management strategies and quality control of obtained products. Finally,
   catalysts stability and recycling aspects should be explored.

AB BACKGROUND: Microalgae biodiesel has attracted considerable attention,
   however, low lipid content has significantly restricted its development.
   Many research studies have demonstrated that nutrient deficiency is an
   important factor stimulating lipid accumulation in algal cells. This
   present study investigated the combined effects of nitrogen, phosphorus,
   and carbon on algal lipid accumulation by Chlorella vulgaris in
   mixotrophic culture. RESULTS: Phosphorus at 0.2 g L-1 concentration
   inhibited Chlorella vulgaris growth but did not influence lipid
   accumulation. High concentration of NaNO3 (3.75 g L-1) inhibited both
   algal growth and lipid accumulation. Nitrogen sufficiency can stimulate
   lipid accumulation. Glucose limitation restricted both biomass
   production and lipid accumulation, resulting in lipid content decrease
   even under nitrogen sufficiency. CO2 was unable to satisfy the carbon
   demand for lipid accumulation when glucose was exhausted in mixotrophic
   culture. The initial C:N ratio of culture medium played an important
   role in algal lipid accumulation. Lipid content was maintained at
   7.6-11.3% when the initial C:N of culture was less than 50, while it
   increased significantly to 23.9% with initial C:N of culture increased
   to 92.7. CONCLUSION: Superior lipid accumulation requires limiting
   nitrogen concentration in the medium solution. High initial C:N ratio
   greater than 86 was found to be beneficial for algal lipid accumulation.

AB Most developing countries are making strenuous efforts to bridge the
   growing food gap resulting from the population explosion The algae
   cultivation and production project is considered one of the investment
   projects of great importance because of the production of algae biomass
   and the biomaterials extracted from it, as it contains effective
   compounds used as food additives and in the work of tablets or capsules
   that are of vital importance to the public health of humans, and were
   used for animals as feed in addition to their use Agricultural
   fertilizers, biofuel production and many other uses, which calls for the
   importance of the financial evaluation of this project and its
   profitability The research dealt with the undiscounted financial
   evaluation criteria and it was found that the break-even point is
   located at the production of 622 kg, which represents about 9.4% of the
   actual production capacity of spirulina algae, and this point achieves
   total revenues equal to the total costs of this production and is
   estimated at 2.026 thousand pounds, and thus the break-even point is It
   has been achieved at an economically acceptable level of operation. The
   payback period amounted to about 1.1 years and a month, meaning that the
   invested capital can be recovered within one year and a month from the
   start of production, which is a shorter and more acceptable period,
   which reflects the positive effects on liquidity, profitability and the
   degree of risk. It was also found that the rate of return on investment
   has reached about 57% This indicates the economic feasibility of this
   project. It also dealt with the discounted financial evaluation
   criteria, and it was found that the net present value amounted to about
   4,634 thousand pounds at a discount rate of 13%, which indicates the
   feasibility of investing in the cultivation of spirulina algae, and the
   ratio of benefits to costs about 1.4, which is greater than the correct
   one, which indicates the feasibility of investing in this project.,
   while the internal rate of return reached about 89%, which is more than
   the prevailing interest rate on borrowing, which confirms the
   feasibility of investing in the spirulina algae cultivation and
   production project. It gives a return of 3.7 pounds. By conducting a
   sensitivity analysis for the project, the project's ability to withstand
   unfavorable changes in case of increased costs, decreased revenues,
   increased costs and decreased revenues together, where the internal rate
   of return reached about 70%, 58%, and 44%, respectively.

AB Cyanobacteria, as photosynthetic bacteria, can generate energy and
   carbon sources directly from sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide.
   With the aid of genetic engineering, heterologous enzymes and/or
   pathways have been introduced into cyanobacteria, enabling the
   production of various biofuels and biochemicals. By utilizing
   cyanobacteria as production hosts, biofuels and biochemicals can be
   produced directly from carbon dioxide, and ultimately carbon dioxide
   fixation by cyanobacteria can help reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide
   concentration, alleviating global warming and air pollution. In this
   review, we introduce various biofuels and biochemicals produced,
   particularly from acetyl-CoA by cyanobacteria, and summarize research
   strategies that have been made to improve their production. This review
   will provide comprehensive information and valuable insights into
   strategies for enhancing cyanobacterial biofuels/chemicals production.

AB Direct landspreading of anaerobic digestates is the most common
   digestate management strategy. Nevertheless, digestate post-treatment
   can be unavoidable, especially for environmental services providers
   operating large-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) facilities. This review
   aims to assess the technical feasibility of achieving value-added
   products from digestates from urban and/or centralized AD plants
   (UC-AD). An exhaustive effort was dedicated to identifying and
   clarifying the available processing technologies and specific issues
   that can be related to UC-AD digestates. The valorization options were
   classified according to the final product destination. The result is a
   useful information source for assessing digestate valorization pathway
   given a local market and context. Agriculture was the first destination
   to be considered, as it allows a more direct closing of nutrient and
   carbon cycles. Several processes exist either for concentrating
   desirable characteristics of digestates, enhancing organic matter
   stability or producing pure and reformulated fertilizers. Thermal
   conversion processes are either under development or full-scale
   demonstration. They allow to valorize the solids through the production
   of biofuels and/or biochar and in the coming future, to start a whole
   biorefinery system. Similarly, biomass harvesting processes such as
   microalgae are under upscaling, enabling to valorize the nutrients of
   the digestate liquid phase while producing renewable biomass from
   sunlight. Several value-added products were already obtained in
   laboratory to pilot conditions from UC-AD digestates, for example,
   biopesticides, biosurfactants and composite materials. Adding to
   technical challenges, the quality variation of digestates, regulation
   barriers, public acceptance and the difficult access to new markets are
   among the main obstacles to UC-AD digestates valorization into
   value-added products.

AB Biofuels from algae are considered as promising alternatives of
   conventional fossil fuels, as they can eliminate most of the
   environmental problems. The present study focuses on all the possible
   avenues of biofuels production through biochemical and thermochemical
   conversion methods in one place, bringing together both microalgae and
   macroalgae on the same platform. It provides a brief overview on the
   mechanism of different biofuel production from algae. Factors affecting
   the biofuel process and the associated challenges have been highlighted
   alongwith analysis of techno-economic study available in literature.
   Undoubtly, biodiesel is the center of attraction among other biofuels.
   However, their routes and process need to be optimized in order to bring
   the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of biodiesel competitive.
   Technological challenges have not been overcome to make biofuel
   production process energetically and commercially viable. Macroalgae are
   low in lipid content. Therefore, the use of macroalgae is restricted for
   gaseous fuels or fermentative methods of liquid biofuels production.
   Anaerobic digestion of algal biomass is easy and seems promising as the
   process is simple in terms of engineering and infrastructure
   requirement. Hydrogen production by microalgae through biophotolysis
   seems interesting as it directly converts the solar energy into
   hydrogen. However, the process has not been scaled-up till today.
   Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is more promising due to handling of wet
   biomass at moderate temperature and pressure and conversion of whole
   biomass into high quality oil. However, HTL process is energy intensive.

AB Microalgae are considered the most suitable feedstock for biodiesel
   production due to their higher areal productivity and lipid content. The
   economical production of biofuels from microalgae is important. This
   paper is a review of different techniques used for flocculating
   microalgae such as use of inorganic salts, organic salts,
   bioflocculants, autoflocculation and electrolytic flocculation for
   harvesting microalgae for biodiesel production. It was found that the
   usage of natural flocculants for harvesting microalgae eliminates the
   toxicity of biomass harvested but the cost of flocculant makes it
   uneconomical for large scale applications. The economic method of
   harvesting large quantity of microalgae still requires further research
   and development.

AB Microbial oils have been considered a renewable feedstock for bioenergy
   not competing with food crops for arable land, freshwater and biodiverse
   natural landscapes. Microalgal oils may also have other purposes (niche
   markets) besides biofuels production such as pharmaceutical,
   nutraceutical, cosmetic and food industries. The polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (PUFAs) obtained from oleaginous microalgae show benefits over
   other PUFAs sources such as fish oils, being odorless, and non-dependent
   on fish stocks. Heterotrophic microalgae can use low-cost substrates
   such as organic wastes/residues containing carbon, simultaneously
   producing PUFAs together with other lipids that can be further converted
   into bioenergy, for combined heat and power (CHP), or liquid biofuels,
   to be integrated in the transportation system. This review analyses the
   different strategies that have been recently used to cultivate and
   further process heterotrophic microalgae for lipids, with emphasis on
   omega-3 rich compounds. It also highlights the importance of studying an
   integrated process approach based on the use of low-cost substrates
   associated to the microalgal biomass biorefinery, identifying the best
   sustainability methodology to be applied to the whole integrated system.

AB The rise in energy consumption and non-renewable fossil fuel depletion
   has sparked interest in finding more sustainable fuel alternatives.
   Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) is a prime candidate to replace
   conventional hydrocarbon (HC) fuels as it is renewable and has a high
   calorific value. However, the existing processes to convert vegetable
   oil to HVO involve extreme operating conditions and expensive metal
   catalysts. Recently, photodecarboxylase derived from Chlorella
   variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) has demonstrated great potential to convert
   fatty acid (FA) to renewable HC fuel in the presence of blue light. This
   is a simple one-step process that does not form any intermediates. This
   review summarized the findings related toCvFAP-catalyzed renewable HC
   fuel production, including the catalytic mechanism and challenges in
   scale-up and commercialization. Current studies have demonstrated great
   potential to produce renewable HC fuel from FA usingCvFAP.

U2 68
AB Microalgae biomass production with starch wastewater (SW) is a promising
   approach to realize waste recovery and cost reduction due to the
   inherent copious nutrients and nontoxic compounds in SW. However, the
   application of this technique is significantly hindered by low biomass
   production on account of the poor photosynthetic efficiency of
   microalgae. In this regard, we proposed a photo-regulation strategy
   characterized by the adjusting of numbers of light/dark (L/D) cycles,
   and compositions of light wavelength, which was proved to be an
   effective method for stimulating intracellular photo electron transfer
   and enhancing photosynthetic efficiency, to boost microalgae biomass
   accumulation. Additionally, responses of the microalgae
   photo-biochemical conversion, and the wastewater treatment performance
   at various number of L/D cycles and light wavelengths were discussed.
   The experimental results indicated that the biomass production increased
   when the L/D period was increased from 2 h:2 h-12 h:12 h. When the L/D
   period was 2 h:2 h, the biomass production reached a maximum value of
   1.28 g L-1, which was 19.6% higher than that of the control group when
   the L/D period was 12 h:12 h. Furthermore, with respect to microalgae
   growth under monochromatic light, the maximum biomass concentration
   (1.25 g L-1) and lipid content (32.2%) ofChlorellawere achieved under
   blue light; whereas, the minimum values were attained under red light
   (1.05 g L-1and 19.3%, respectively). When the red light and blue light
   were mixed and supplied, the microalgae biomass productivity was higher
   than that under white light, and the highest lipid productivity was
   109.0 mg-1L-1d under a blue: red ratio of 2:1. Moreover, gas
   chromatography analysis demonstrated that the methyl in the range of
   C16-C18 in the system was higher than 70%. Fatty acid methyl esters
   (FAMEs) containing palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) are
   beneficial for production of biodiesel, and the quality of fatty acid
   methyl ester used in biodiesel production can be improved using
   microalgae cultured under the mixed wavelengths of blue and red.
   Finally,Chlorellawas cultured in PBR and reached the peak concentration
   of 2.45 g L-1by semi-continuous process with the HRT regulation.

AB The quest for renewable and alternative sources of energy is a pressing
   demand of the 21st century considering the rapid escalation in demand
   owing to the rising population. Biodiesel is one of the favorite
   candidates that many scientists, investors, policymakers, etc. are
   banking upon for fulfilling it's demand. Production of biodiesel from
   plant sources has long been researched, but with the rising population
   there is an added issue of the food vs. fuel controversy, which
   jeopardizes this source as an option. Considering this background,
   microbial sources for biodiesel production, viz. oleaginous yeasts,
   fungi and microalgae, are perfect candidates, which can serve the
   purpose of fulfilling the energy demand while avoiding the food vs. fuel
   controversy. In this review article, a comprehensive viewpoint of lipid
   production from various microbial sources is discussed, with major
   emphasis on understanding the biochemistry of lipid accumulation, along
   with the biosynthesis of fatty acids and triacylglycerides, which
   comprise the majority of the lipids. Emphasis is placed on highlighting
   the different biochemical and metabolic strategies adopted to improve
   lipid yields. Finally, a comparison is drawn between the biodiesel
   produced from algal and yeast sources.

AB Fremyella diplosiphon is a freshwater cyanobacterium that has great
   potential as a biofuel agent due to its ability to grow in low light
   intensity and acclimation to different wavelengths. To enhance its
   halotolerance for growth in 35 g L-1 sodium chloride (NaCl), plasmids
   harboring hemolysin B (hlyB) and malate dehydrogenase (mdh) genes were
   transformed into wild type F. diplosiphon (WT-Fd33).
   Electroporation-mediated overexpression of the genes resulted in two
   transformants, HSF33-1 and HSF33-2, with 9- and 20-fold increases in
   hlyB and mdh transcript levels. In addition, up-regulation of proteins
   at the expected size ranges of 50-60 kDa for HlyB and 40-50 kDa for MDH
   was observed. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed a protein spot
   corresponding to HlyB in HSF33-1 with a significant MOWSE score of 164
   and 3% sequence coverage, and a spot corresponding to MDH in HSF33-2
   gave a significant MOWSE score of 124 with 10% sequence coverage.
   Physiological evaluation in BG11/HEPES medium and seawater adjusted to
   35 g L-1 NaCl confirmed that the transformants could thrive in high
   salinity with no loss of photosynthetic pigments. Results of the study
   indicate that overexpression of hlyB and mdh genes confer halotolerance
   in F. diplosiphon, thus maximizing its potential as a large-scale
   biofuel agent.

AB Botryococcus braunii, a colonial green microalga which is well-known for
   its capacity to synthesize hydrocarbons, has significant promise as a
   long-term source of feedstock for the generation of biofuels. However,
   cultivating and scaling up B. braunii using conventional aqua-suspended
   cultivation systems remains a challenge. In this study, we optimized
   medium components and light intensity to enhance lipid and hydrocarbon
   production in a multi-cultivator airlift photobioreactor. BBM 3N medium
   with 200 mumol/m2/s light intensity and a 16 h light-8 h dark regimen
   yielded the highest biomass productivity (110.00  2.88 mg/L/day), as
   well as the highest lipid and hydrocarbon content. Cultivation in a
   flat-panel bioreactor resulted in significantly higher biomass
   productivity (129.11  2.74 mg/L/day), lipid productivity (32.21  1.31
   mg/L/day), and hydrocarbon productivity (28.98  2.08 mg/L/day) compared
   to cultivation in Erlenmeyer flasks and open 20-L raceway pond. It also
   exhibited 20.15  1.03% of protein content including elevated levels of
   chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids. This work is noteworthy
   since it is the first to describe fatty acid and hydrocarbon profiles of
   B. braunii during cobalt treatment. The study demonstrated that high
   cobalt concentrations (up to 5 mg/L of cobalt nitrate) during
   Botryococcus culture affected hydrocarbon synthesis, resulting in high
   amounts of n-alkadienes and trienes as well as lipids with elevated
   monounsaturated fatty acids concentration. Furthermore, pyrolysis
   experiments on microalgal green biomass and de-oiled biomass revealed
   the lipid and hydrocarbon compounds generated by the thermal degradation
   of B. braunii that facilitate extra economical value to this system.

   stress environment, the improvement of cell separation efficiency and
   processing time from culture broth, the multiple reuse of magnetic

   Higher total volatile fatty acids (VFA) production (mg L-1) is observed
   in EF/AV (2866), depicting 31% and 57% increments than EF/CC (1984) and
   EF/C (1224), respectively. The VFA profiles (C2-C4) in EF/AV are higher
   with acetic/butyric/propionic acids (1922/704/240 mg L-1) and biogas
   co-generation [H2 (22%) and CH4 (3%)] than EF/CC and EF/C. The applied
   voltage (EF/AV) helps in electron flux regulation for increasing
   substrates conversion and VFA generation. Residual VFA-rich effluents
   from EF process is utilized as substrate to mixotrophic microalgae
   cultivation (nutrient- and stress-phase) that resulted in biomass
   production with simultaneous wastewater treatment. EF/AV depicts higher
   biomass growth (0.72 g L-1; 4th day) and substrate removal (63%) than

AB Microalgae have the potential to be an excellent source of sustainable
   and renewable biofuel. However, different issues surrounding their
   economic viability and upscale application need to be resolved.
   Microalgal dewatering requires substantial energy to concentrate the
   highly dilute microalgal culture and is considered a major bottleneck
   that limits industrial mass production. Compared to traditional
   microalgal dewatering processes, membrane technology offers many
   advantages such as lower energy consumption, simple operation, reduced
   chemical usage, and scaling-up capability. Membranes can also be used in
   biodiesel separation and purification, which is a very important step to
   achieve a finished biodiesel product that complies with the
   international standards and specifications (e.g., free glycerol limit of
   0.02 mass%). The use of membrane filtration in the biodiesel refining
   process is a promising technology to reduce the water usage and
   wastewater disposal required in the conventional water-washing process
   and to avoid non-recyclable solvents used in the dry-washing process.
   However, the main challenge in membrane application is fouling, which
   has adverse effects such as flux reduction and increased cleaning
   frequency. Hence, the development of environment-friendly, low-cost and
   anti-fouling membranes is paramount to reduce the costs and energy
   consumption to feasible levels for both microalgal dewatering and
   biodiesel refining processes. This review discusses the challenges that
   hinder the economical production of microalgal biofuels at
   commercial-scale and identifies strategies for mitigating
   membrane-fouling in order to optimize the economics of algal biomass
   production and downstream processing.

   still a need to research algae production systems, downstream processing
   (e.g., biofuel production) needs to be researched in parallel. As there
   are several methods to produce biofuel from algae, different possible
   production processes are reviewed. By investigating the different steps
   of each of the processes and highlighting the challenges and risks that
   can occur, it is possible to make a decision regarding which pathway
   might be feasible for algal resources in the future.

AB Disposal of metal contaminated biomass after bioremediation poses
   challenges due to non-availability of suitable techniques. In the
   present study, an attached algal biofilm reactor (ABR) of 3 L capacity
   was used for remediating six heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Cd)
   from a metal mix and subsequently the biomass after bioremediation was
   hydrothermally liquefied to see the fate of the heavy metals. The algal
   biofilm was a consortium ofPhormidiumandChlorellawhich was able to
   remove between 50-90% of the heavy metals after 6 d. The metal removal
   trend followed the order Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cd. Hydrothermal
   liquefaction of the metal contaminated biomass was done at 230°C of
   temperature, 27 bar of pressure, water to biomass ratio of 4, K2CO3as
   catalyst and holding time of 20 min under N2environment in a high
   temperature pressure reactor. The biocrude obtained in presence of
   metals had a HHV of 20 MJ kg-1compared with 19.32 MJ kg-1in control
   (without metal). The heavy metal analysis of the solid and aqueous
   fraction showed that >70% of the metals had partitioned into the solid
   fraction whereas <1% were in the aqueous fraction. The aqueous fraction
   was also rich in nitrate and phosphate which could be reused for algal
   cultivation. Hence, hydrothermal liquefaction could be a very useful
   technique for valorisation of metal contaminated biomass for a
   sustainable biorefinery.

   biorefinery perspectives of the process.

AB It is imperative to search for appropriate processes to convert wastes
   into energy, chemicals, and materials to establish a circular
   bio-economy toward sustainable development. Concerning waste biomass
   valorization, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a promising route
   given its advantages over other thermochemical processes. From that
   perspective, this article reviewed the HTC of potential biomass wastes,
   the characterization and environmental utilization of hydrochar, and the
   biorefinery potential of this process. Crop and forestry residues and
   sewage sludge are two categories of biomass wastes (lignocellulosic and
   non-lignocellulosic, respectively) readily available for HTC or even
   co-hydrothermal carbonization (Co-HTC). The temperature, reaction time,
   and solid-to-liquid ratio utilized in HTC/Co-HTC of those biomass wastes
   were reported to range from 140 to 370°C, 0.05 to 48 h, and 1/47 to 1/1,
   respectively, providing hydrochar yields of up to 94% according to the
   process conditions. Hydrochar characterization by different techniques
   to determine its physicochemical properties is crucial to defining the
   best applications for this material. In the environmental field,
   hydrochar might be suitable for removing pollutants from aqueous
   systems, ameliorating soils, adsorbing atmospheric pollutants, working
   as an energy carrier, and performing carbon sequestration. But this
   material could also be employed in other areas (e.g., catalysis).
   Regarding the effluent from HTC/Co-HTC, this byproduct has the potential
   for serving as feedstock in other processes, such as anaerobic digestion
   and microalgae cultivation. These opportunities have aroused the
   industry interest in HTC since 2010, and the number of industrial-scale
   HTC plants and patent document applications has increased. The hydrochar
   patents are concentrated in China (77.6%), the United States (10.6%),
   the Republic of Korea (3.5%), and Germany (3.5%). Therefore, considering
   the possibilities of converting their product (hydrochar) and byproduct
   (effluent) into energy, chemicals, and materials, HTC or Co-HTC could
   work as the first step of a biorefinery. And this approach would
   completely agree with circular bioeconomy principles.

AB Bio-hydrogen from microalgae including cyanobacteria has attracted
   commercial awareness due to its potential as an alternative, reliable
   and renewable energy source. Photosynthetic hydrogen production from
   microalgae can be interesting and promising options for clean energy.
   Advances in hydrogen-fuel-cell technology may attest an eco-friendly way
   of biofuel production, since, the use of H2 to generate electricity
   releases only water as a by-product. Progress in genetic/metabolic
   engineering may significantly enhance the photobiological hydrogen
   production from microalgae. Manipulation of competing metabolic pathways
   by modulating the certain key enzymes such as hydrogenase and
   nitrogenase may enhance the evolution of H2 from photoautotrophic cells.
   Moreover, biological H2 production at low operating costs is requisite
   for economic viability. Several photobioreactors have been developed for
   large-scale biomass and hydrogen production. This review highlights the
   recent technological progress, enzymes involved and genetic as well as
   metabolic engineering approaches towards sustainable hydrogen production
   from microalgae.

AB Microalgae-based biorefinery processes are gaining particular importance
   as a biotechnological tool for direct carbon dioxide fixation and
   production of high-quality biomass and energy feedstock for different
   industrial markets. However, despite the many technological advances in
   photobioreactor designs and operations, microalgae cultivation is still
   limited due to the low yields achieved in open systems and to the high
   investment and operation costs of closed photobioreactors. In this work,
   a new alveolar flat panel photobioreactor was designed and characterized
   with the aim of achieving high microalgae productivities and CO2
   bio-fixation rates. Moreover, the energy efficiency of the employed
   pump-assisted hydraulic circuit was evaluated. The 1.3 cm thick alveolar
   flat-panels enhance the light utilization, whereas the hydraulic design
   of the photobioreactor aims to improve the global CO2 gas-liquid mass
   transfer coefficient (kLaCO2). The mixing time, liquid flow velocity,
   and kLaCO2 as well as the uniformity matrix of the artificial lighting
   source were experimentally calculated. The performance of the system was
   tested by cultivating the green microalga Acutodesmus obliquus. A
   volumetric biomass concentration equal to 1.9 g L-1 was achieved after 7
   days under controlled indoor cultivation conditions with a CO2
   bio-fixation efficiency of 64% of total injected CO2. The (gross) energy
   consumption related to substrate handling was estimated to be between 27
   and 46 Wh m-3, without any cost associated to CO2 injection and O2
   degassing. The data suggest that this pilot-scale cultivation system may
   constitute a relevant technology in the development of microalgae-based
   industrial scenario for CO2 mitigation and biomass production.

AB Microalgae are explored as the sustainable source of biodiesel
   production considering their multi restorative effects on water and air.
   In spite of rapid growth and high lipid content, production of
   microalgal biodiesel is energy intensive and costly affair. Efficient
   oil extraction is one of the major hurdles; which needs special
   attention for making the microalgae biodiesel production process
   economical. Current review paper discusses various types of extraction
   methods starting from conventional organic solvent extraction method to
   advance methods like microwave irradiation, ultrasound, supercritical
   fluids and ionic liquids for oil extraction and also the direct
   transesterification. Modern methods give better yield in comparison to
   conventional methods. The variation of properties of microalgae
   biodiesel with respect to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition is
   also highlighted and the properties are compared against established
   standards. Also, the previous studies on performance and emission
   characteristics using microalgae have been reviewed and it is found that
   microalgae biodiesel is on comparable scale to that of first and second
   generation biofuel. Lots of research scope and further developments in
   harvesting, drying, oil extraction and direct transesterification stages
   can potentially establish microalgae as next generation source for
   transport fuel production.

   includes a brief description of the transesterification process and the
   point source of biodiesel wastewater, from which it is mainly generated.
   Biodiesel wastewater is characterized by high contents of chemical
   oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), oil, methanol,
   soap and glycerol. The treatments developed so far for biodiesel
   wastewater are also described. The authors also investigate the
   significance, ability and possibility of biological aerated filter (BAF)
   to treat biodiesel wastewater discharged from a biodiesel fuel
   production plant. The whole treatment; coagulation-biological aerated
   filter (CoBAF); involves the pre-treatment of biodiesel wastewater using
   coagulation followed by the treatment using BAF.

AB Fossil fuel is one of the most important sources of energy that have

   these fossil fuels is the primary cause of emissions of greenhouse
   gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which contributes to the warming of
   the planet and enhances greenhouse effect. In order to mitigate the
   negative effects of fossil fuels, biofuel is promoted as the most
   effective and environment friendly alternative to fossil fuels. Among
   the existing feedstocks diatoms and other microalgae have proved to be
   the most abundant source of existing crude oil from the previous studies
   and existing literatures. However, an important alternative for fuel
   from microalgae biomass, is its conversion into bioethanol which is
   currently the most demanding alternatives to fossil fuels replacing
   gasolines and aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the scale-up production of
   bioethanol using microalgae is challenging due to low yields, and high
   cost. It is crucial to discuss economic aspects, and innovations needed
   to overcome these shortcomings. Chemical free technologies such as
   pulsed electric fields (PEF), or induction of biosynthesized
   nanoparticles as pretreatment methods and economic cultivations like
   bubble farming and microalgae in microbial fuel cells could enhance the
   yields, and lower the cost. Wet biomass processing also plays a critical
   role in cost-effective bioethanol production from microalgae. The
   present study will channel the research in bioethanol production using
   microalgae through sustainable approaches such as PEF and biosynthesized
   nanoparticles that can be improved and used for up scaling the
   bioethanol production.

AB The salt-tolerant green microalga Dunaliella salina can survive both
   hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock. Upon osmotic shock, the cells transiently
   and rapidly decreased or increased in size within minutes and slowly
   over hours acquired their original cell size and volume. Cell size
   distribution differs significantly in the cultures grown in the salinity
   range from 1.5 to 15% NaCl. By using Nile Red fluorescence to detect
   neutral lipids, it became clear that only hyper-osmotic shock on cells
   induced transient neutral lipid appearance in D. salina, while those
   transferred from 9 to 15% NaCl stimulated the most neutral lipid
   accumulation. These cells grew well in 9% NaCl, but they cannot recover
   a shift to 15% NaCl and cell division is accordingly slowed down. The
   transient appearance of neutral lipid could be dependent on the
   inhibition of cell division experiencing the NaCl shift. Moreover, the
   effect of nutrient limitation slows down cell division and
   photosynthesis as a secondary result, which triggers the cells to
   accumulate neutral storage lipids when they entered the stationary
   phase, which is seen in all the batch cultures of D. salina grown in the
   salinity range of 3-15%. The changes in salt concentration did not
   significantly influence the overall fatty acid composition in D. salina
   cells. Although there shows both increased amounts of total lipids and
   neutral lipids in the cells grown in salinity higher than 9% NaCl, lipid
   productivity is however compromised by the slower cell growth rate and
   lower cell density under this condition.

AB Biodiesel is an attractive renewable energy in Iran. However, the
   concerns for food security, emissions, and water requirement move us
   towards developing the analytical framework to study emission-water
   nexus of biodiesel via the multi objective sustainable planning of
   biodiesel supply chain. Here, the literature of biodiesel in Iran is
   comprehensively reviewed and main issues are discussed. Then, a supply
   chain planning model is applied to depict the optimal path ways to
   minimize costs, net emission, and water use in Iran during 25 years. The
   microalgae via open ponds and jatropha cultivation reduce the total
   costs and improve negative emissions. The jatropha optimizes the water
   use and increases negative emissions. The results indicate that the
   integrated management of water must be carefully considered to select
   optimal pathway of the environmental friendly biofuel strategies. This
   paper provides the optimal frame work for the policy makers to consider
   different aspects for the future of the biodiesel supply chain of the
   country.

AB Photosynthetic microbial fuel cells (pMFCs) are a developing technology
   for sustainable energy production, harnessing the combined effects of
   biological and electrochemical processes. In a typical pMFC,
   microorganisms form a biofilm on the anode and oxidize organic
   substrates to produce electrons, which are transported through an
   external circuit to the cathode, generating electricity. In the cathode
   compartment there are photosynthetic organisms, which make the
   difference comparing to typical microbial fuel cell (MFC). In this case
   these organisms are Chlorella vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis.
   Photosynthetic microbial fuel cells can be used for applications such as
   renewable energy generation and wastewater treatment. This study
   explores the influence of electric stimulation on biofilm growth and the
   overall functionality of pMFCs. Various stimulation voltages were
   applied to determine their effect on biofilm formation and microbial
   activity, with the most effective voltage identified as 1 V. Different
   stimulation periods were also tested, and the best results were obtained
   with constant 4-day stimulation at the start of the experiment.
   Additionally, the effect of electric stimulation was examined in the
   presence of Chlorella vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis in the cathode
   chamber, yielding some interesting results. These findings contribute to
   the optimization of pMFCs through bioelectrical regulation, offering
   potential advancements in renewable energy technologies and wastewater
   treatment applications.

AB Global warming is induced partly by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide

   review carbon capture, usage, and storage with microalgae, with focus on
   methods to improve carbon dioxide uptake, systems combining wastewater
   and flue gases, machine learning for strain identification, artificial
   intelligence and automation, and the circular bioeconomy. Carbon dioxide
   uptake by microalgae can be improved by using modified photobioreactors,
   membranes, chemical methods, solvents, adapted strains, genetically
   engineered strains, omics, and nanotechnology. We also discuss the
   economic viability of microalgae-based carbon capture and bioenergy
   generation. On an average, microalgal farming on 13 million acres area
   can sequester approximately 0.5 gigatons of CO2to generate more than 300
   tons of biomass.

AB Carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) are common among microalgae, but
   their regulation and even existence in some of the most promising
   biofuel production strains is poorly understood. This is partly because
   screening for new strains does not commonly include assessment of CCM
   function or regulation despite its fundamental role in primary carbon
   metabolism. In addition, the inducible nature of many microalgal CCMs
   means that environmental conditions should be considered when assessing
   CCM function and its potential impact on biofuels. In this study, we
   address the effect of environmental conditions by combining novel, high
   frequency, on-line 13CO2 gas exchange screen with microscope-based lipid
   characterization to assess CCM function in Nannochloropsis salina and
   its interaction with lipid production. Regulation of CCM function was
   explored by changing the concentration of CO2 provided to continuous
   cultures in airlift bioreactors where cell density was kept constant
   across conditions by controlling the rate of media supply. Our isotopic
   gas exchange results were consistent with N. salina having an inducible
   "pump-leak" style CCM similar to that of Nannochloropsis gaditana.
   Though cells grew faster at high CO2 and had higher rates of net CO2
   uptake, we did not observe significant differences in lipid content
   between conditions. Since the rate of CO2 supply was much higher for the
   high CO2 conditions, we calculated that growing cells bubbled with low
   CO2 is about 40% more efficient for carbon capture than bubbling with
   high CO2. We attribute this higher efficiency to the activity of a CCM
   under low CO2 conditions.

AB Much emphasis has been given to algal biomass growth in dairy farm
   wastewater. Most of the systems examined require productive land to be
   converted and/or freshwater use to dilute high concentrations of
   nutrients found in dairy effluent. A rotating algal biofilm (RABR)
   provides the capacity to grow algae without sacrificing productive land
   or freshwater. In theory, this system would overcome some of the
   economic and environmental challenges that other systems have. A
   combination of theoretical information, nutrient uptake formulas, and
   economic formulas were used to calculate the potential of biogas
   production from algae grown in an RABR with dairy effluents. The average
   nutrient uptake was 0.8 mgN/m2 per day and 0.1 mgP/m2 per day. The
   maximum methane production from the anaerobic digestion of algae was 112
   m3/RABR.year. The minimum and maximum economic scenarios resulted in
   gross profits of NZD -2101 and -1922. After evaluating this system for
   the first time in the New Zealand dairy farming context, it was found
   that biogas production from an RABR is not a feasible option for New
   Zealand dairy farmers.

AB Anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) can utilise spare digestion capacity at
   existing wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) to generate surplus biogas
   beyond the plant's internal energy requirement. Data from industry
   reports and the peer-reviewed literature show that through AcoD,
   numerous examples of WWTPs have become net energy producers,
   necessitating other high-value applications for surplus biogas. A
   globally emerging trend is to upgrade biogas to biomethane, which can
   then be used as town gas or transport fuel. Water, organic solvent and
   chemical scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption, membrane separation, and
   cryogenic technology are commercially available CO2 removal technologies
   for biogas upgrade. Although water scrubbing is currently the most
   widely applied technology due to low capital and operation cost,
   significant market growth in membrane separation has been seen over the
   2015-2019 period. Further progress in materials engineering and sciences
   is expected and will further enhance the membrane separation
   competitiveness for biogas upgrading. Several emerging biotechnologies
   to (i) improve biogas quality from AcoD; (ii) accelerate the absorption
   rate, and (iii) captures CO2 in microalgal culture have also been
   examined and discussed in this review. Through a combination of AcoD and
   biogas upgrade, more WWTPs are expected to become net energy producers.

AB Microalgal biomass is currently considered as a sustainable and
   renewable feedstock for biofuel production (biohydrogen, biomethane,
   biodiesel) characterized by lower emissions of hazardous air pollutants
   than fossil fuels. Photobioreactors for microalgae growth can be
   exploited using many industrial and domestic wastes. It allows locating
   the commercial microalgal systems in areas that cannot be employed for
   agricultural purposes, i.e., near heating or wastewater treatment plants
   and other industrial facilities producing carbon dioxide and organic and
   nutrient compounds. Despite their high potential, the large-scale algal
   biomass production technologies are not popular because the systems for
   biomass production, separation, drainage, and conversion into energy
   carriers are difficult to explicitly assess and balance, considering the
   ecological and economical concerns. Most of the studies presented in the
   literature have been carried out on a small, laboratory scale. This
   significantly limits the possibility of obtaining reliable data for a
   comprehensive assessment of the efficiency of such solutions. Therefore,
   there is a need to verify the results in pilot-scale and the full
   technical-scale studies. This study summarizes the strengths and
   weaknesses of microalgal biomass production technologies for
   bioenergetic applications.

AB Due to negative environmental influence and limited availability,
   petroleum-derived fuels need to be replaced by renewable biofuels.
   Biodiesel has attracted intensive attention as an important biofuel.
   Microalgae have numerous advantages for biodiesel production over many
   terrestrial plants. There are a series of consecutive processes for
   biodiesel production with microalgae as feedstock, including selection
   of adequate microalgal strains, mass culture, cell harvesting, oil
   extraction and transesterification. To reduce the overall production
   cost, technology development and process optimization are necessary.
   Genetic engineering also plays an important role in manipulating lipid
   biosynthesis in microalgae. Many approaches, such as sequestering carbon
   dioxide from industrial plants for the carbon source, using wastewater
   for the nutrient supply, and maximizing the values of by-products, have
   shown a potential for cost reduction. This review provides a brief
   overview of the process of biodiesel production with microalgae as
   feedstock. The methods associated with this process (e.g. lipid
   determination, mass culture, oil extraction) are also compared and
   discussed.

AB North East India is rich in natural resources including various
   plant-based biomasses. The plant biomass includes forests, energy crops,
   crop and agroprocessing residues, animal manures and algal biomass.
   Organic debris can be recycled and reused and have many possible uses
   depending upon size, quality, species and volume of the material.
   Biomass as an alternative energy source has received much importance in
   terms of future energy security. Biomass based energy technologies may
   be a viable option considering the availability of rich bioresources in
   North East India. The production of biodiesel from the seeds of oil
   bearing plants and microalgae is also one form of biomass utilization.
   Several species of microalgae are present in the wetlands of this region
   which however have hitherto remained untapped. Many microalgal strains
   have been collected and research has been undertaken to screen the
   biodiesel potential of isolated and identified strains of microalgae
   native to this region. The abundant biomass of this region also offers
   suitable substrates for production of mushroom. Moreover, several
   varieties of edible mushrooms grow wild in this region, which are being
   domesticated and cultivated for large-scale production. Availability of
   large amount of crop and other plant residues offers ample scope for
   conversion of these biomasses into useful products such as vermicompost
   and other biofertilizers. The rationale behind this type of approach is
   to focus on judicious utilization of natural resources towards
   sustainable development of the country in general and the North East
   India in particular. This review highlight the potential biomass
   resources of Northeast Indian region, the challenges and opportunities
   arising from increasing demands for biomass as well the current
   technologies available for exploring these biomass resources towards
   sustainable utilization.

SO Science of the Total Environment

U1 8
U2 146
AB Intensive and extensive use of pesticides has contributed to their wide
   distribution in soil, air, and water. Due to their detrimental effects
   on non-target organisms, different technologies have been considered for
   their removal. In this work, three hydrophobic pesticide active
   compounds, namely, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, and oxadiazon, were
   selected to study the potential for their removal from aqueous media by
   a microalgae consortium. An abiotic and a killed control (thermally
   inactivated dead microalgae biomass) were employed to clarify their
   removal pathways, and pesticide content was quantified in liquid and
   biomass phases for 7 days. At the final time, total degradation
   (biodegradation plus photodegradation) contributed to the removal of 55%
   of oxadiazon, 35% of chlorpyrifos, and 14% of cypermethrin. Furthermore,
   more than 60% of chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were removed by sorption
   onto microalgae biomass. Overall, the three pesticides showed high
   removal from the liquid phase. O, O-diethyl thiophosphate was identified
   in the liquid phase as a transformation product of chlorpyrifos formed
   by microalgae degradation. Phycoremediation was coupled with anaerobic
   degradation of the microalgae biomass containing the retained pesticides
   by sorption through biochemical methane potential tests. Anaerobic
   digestion was not inhibited by the pesticides as verified by methane
   production yields. The removal efficiency of the pesticides in the
   digestate was as follows: chlorpyrifos > cypermethrin > oxadiazon. These
   results highlight the potential of low-cost algal-based systems for the
   treatment of wastewater or effluents from agrochemical industries. The
   integration of wastewater treatment with biogas production through
   anaerobic digestion is a biorefinery approach that facilitates the
   economic feasibility of the process.

AB The lipid productivity controlled by both of biomass and lipid content
   was really crucial for economic-feasibility of microalgae-based biofuels
   production. This study attempted at augmenting lipid productivity in an
   emerging oleaginous model alga Coccomyxa subellipsoidea by different
   nitrogen manipulation including one-stage continuous N-sufficiency
   (OCNS), N-deprivation (OCND), N-limitation (OCNL), and also two-stage
   batch N-starvation (TBNS). Amongst four tested nitrogen manipulation
   strategies, OCNS performed remarkable promoting effect on cell metabolic
   growth and the maximum biomass was achieved by 7.39 g/L. Whereas TBNS
   regime induced the highest lipid content (over 50.5%). Only OCNL
   treatment augmented the lipid productivity by 232.37 mg/L/day,
   representing 1.25-fold more than TBNS and even as much as 5.06-fold more
   than that of OCND strategy. OCNL also strengthened the proportions of
   saturated (C16:0 and C18:0) and monounsaturated fatty acid (C18:1) which
   were inclined to high-quality biofuels-making. This might be due to that
   most part of energy and metabolic flux (e.g. acetyl-CoA) derived from
   TCA cycle and glycolysis flowed into fatty acids biosynthesis pathway
   (especially C18:1) response to OCNL manipulation. This study represented
   a pioneering work of utilizing OCNL for lipids production by C.
   subellipsoidea and clearly implied that OCNL might be a feasible way for
   algal lipid production on a commercial scale and also promoted the
   potential of C. subellipsoidea as an ideal biodiesel feedstock.

AB A current concern is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, mainly
   CO2, with anthropogenic sources being the main contributors. Microalgae
   have greater capacity than terrestrial plants to capture CO2, with this
   being an attraction for using them as capture systems. This study aims
   at the techno-economic evaluation of microalgae biomass production,
   while only considering technologies with industrial scaling potential.
   Energy consumption and operating costs are considered as parameters for
   the evaluation. In addition, the capture of CO2 from a thermoelectric
   plant is analyzed, as a carbon source for the cultivation of microalgae.
   24 scenarios were evaluated while using process simulation tools
   (SuperPro Designer), being generated by the combination of cultivations
   in raceway pond, primary harvest with three types of flocculants,
   secondary harvest with centrifugation and three filtering technologies,
   and finally the drying evaluated with Spray and Drum Dryer. Low biomass
   productivity, 12.7 g/m2/day, was considered, achieving a capture of
   102.13 tons of CO2/year in 1 ha for the cultivation area. The scenarios
   that included centrifugation and vacuum filtration are the ones with the
   highest energy consumption. The operating costs range from US $
   4.75-6.55/kg of dry biomass. The choice of the best scenario depends on
   the final use of biomass.

AB Mass production of microalgae is currently limited by existing
   cultivation strategies, which rely heavily on open cultivation systems.
   Increasing lipid production in these systems while minimizing the
   invasion of non-target algae (competitors) and grazers (predators) will
   improve the economic viability of algal biofuel. In this study, we
   manipulate a basic environmental parameter, salinity, to promote algal
   growth and limit invading organisms. We monitor the growth of marine
   microalga Nannochloropsis salina and invasion of algal competitors and
   predators in open cultures grown at different salinities ranging from
   brackish to hypersaline. Algal growth and biomass was greatest at
   salinities of 22 and 34 PSU, whereas the density of invading organisms
   was lowest at 22 PSU. To determine if lipid accumulation could be
   maximized by salinity stress, we grew N. salina at 22 PSU until the
   populations were at stationary phase and then increased salinity to 34,
   46, and 58 PSU. Gravimetrically determined lipid content increased
   significantly at these higher salinities, and was highest at 34 PSU (36%
   dry tissue mass). Analysis of Folch extracts by FT-ICR mass spectrometry
   showed a monotonic increase in triglyceride content and decreased
   membrane lipid content with increased salinity. Together, this work
   demonstrates an ecological approach to overcome the current limitations
   of cultivation strategies.

AB Background: Microalgae as a viable biodiesel feedstock show great
   potential to approach the challenges of energy shortage and environment
   pollution, but their economic feasibility was seriously hampered by high
   production cost. Thus, it is in urgent need to reduce the cost of
   cultivation and improve the biomass and lipid production of microalgae.
   In this work, anaerobic digestion effluent from cattle manure combined
   with municipal wastewater was used as a cost-effective medium for
   cultivating microalgae and expected to obtain high biomass. The
   pretreatment of anaerobic digested effluent containing dilution rate,
   sterilization and nutrient optimization was investigated. Then, initial
   pH and light intensity for algal growth, lipid production and wastewater
   purification were optimized in this study. Results:Scenedesmussp. could
   grow rapidly in 10% anaerobic digestion effluent from cattle manure
   combined with secondary sedimentation tank effluent without
   sterilization. Optimum nutrient additives for higher biomass were as
   follows: glucose 10 g/L, NaNO30.3 g/L, K2HPO4.3H2O 0.01 g/L, MgSO4.7H2O
   0.075 g/L and trace element A5 solution 1 mL/L. Biomass of 4.65 g/L and
   lipid productivity of 81.90 mg/L/day were achieved during 7-day
   cultivation accompanying over 90% of COD, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and 79-88% of
   PO43--P removal with optimized initial pH of 7.0 and light intensity of
   5000 l*. The FAME profile in ADEC growth medium consisted in saturated
   (39.48%) and monounsaturated (60.52%) fatty acids with the 16- to
   18-chain-length fatty acids constituting over 98% of total FAME.
   Conclusions: This study proves the potential of anaerobic digested
   effluent combined with municipal wastewater for microalgae culture, and
   provides an effective avenue for simultaneous microalgal lipid
   production and treatment of two kinds of wastewater.

AB The depletion of fossil fuel reserves has resulted from their
   application in the industrial and energy sectors. As a result,
   substantial efforts have been dedicated to fostering the shift from
   fossil fuels to renewable energy sources via technological advancements
   in industrial processes. Microalgae can be used to produce biofuels such
   as biodiesel, hydrogen, and bioethanol. Microalgae are particularly
   suitable for hydrogen production due to their rapid growth rate, ability
   to thrive in diverse habitats, ability to resolve conflicts between fuel
   and food production, and capacity to capture and utilize atmospheric
   carbon dioxide. Therefore, microalgae-based biohydrogen production has
   attracted significant attention as a clean and sustainable fuel to
   achieve carbon neutrality and sustainability in nature. To this end, the
   review paper emphasizes recent information related to microalgae-based
   biohydrogen production, mechanisms of sustainable hydrogen production,
   factors affecting biohydrogen production by microalgae, bioreactor
   design and hydrogen production, advanced strategies to improve
   efficiency of biohydrogen production by microalgae, along with
   bottlenecks and perspectives to overcome the challenges. This review
   aims to collate advances and new knowledge emerged in recent years for
   microalgae-based biohydrogen production and promote the adoption of
   biohydrogen as an alternative to conventional hydrocarbon biofuels,
   thereby expediting the carbon neutrality target that is most
   advantageous to the environment.

AB Background: Microalgal starch is regarded as a promising alternative to
   crop-based starch for biorefinery such as the production of biofuels and
   bio-based chemicals. The single or separate use of inorganic carbon
   source, e.g., CO2and NaHCO3, caused aberrant pH, which restricts the
   biomass and starch production. The present study applied an in situ
   CO2-NaHCO3system to regulate photosynthetic biomass and starch
   production along with starch quality in a marine green
   microalgaTetraselmis subcordiformisunder nitrogen-depletion (-N) and
   nitrogen-limitation (N) conditions. Results: The CO2(2%)-NaHCO3(1 g L-1)
   system stabilized the pH at 7.7 in the -N cultivation, under which the
   optimal biomass and starch accumulation were achieved. The biomass and
   starch productivity under -N were improved by 2.1-fold and 1.7-fold,
   respectively, with 1 g L-1NaHCO3addition compared with the one without
   NaHCO3addition. NaHCO3addition alleviated the high-dCO2inhibition caused
   by the single CO2aeration, and provided sufficient effective carbon
   source HCO3-for the maintenance of adequate photosynthetic efficiency
   and increase in photoprotection to facilitate the biomass and starch
   production. The amylose content was also increased by 44% under this
   CO2-bicarbonate system compared to the single use of CO2. The highest
   starch productivity of 0.73 g L-1day-1under -N cultivation and highest
   starch concentration of 4.14 g L-1under N cultivation were both achieved
   with the addition of 1 g L-1NaHCO3. These levels were comparable to or
   exceeded the current achievements reported in studies. The addition of 5
   g L-1NaHCO3under N cultivation led to a production of high-amylose
   starch (59.3% of total starch), which could be used as a source of
   functional food. Conclusions: The in situ CO2-NaHCO3system significantly
   improved the biomass and starch production inT. subcordiformis. It could
   also regulate the starch quality with varied relative amylose content
   under different cultivation modes for diverse downstream applications
   that could promote the economic feasibility of microalgal starch-based
   biofuel production. Adoption of this system inT. subcordiformiswould
   facilitate the CO2mitigation couple with its starch-based biorefinery.

AB Algal culturing in photobioreactors for biofuel and other value-added
   products is a challenge globally specifically due to expensive closed or
   open photobioreactors associated with the high cost, problems of water
   loss and contamination. Among the wide varieties of microalgae, diatoms
   have come out as potential source for crude oil in the form of Diafuel
   (biofuel from diatoms). However, culturing diatoms at large scale
   hypothesized as diatom solar panels for biofuel production is still
   facing a need for facile and economical production of value-added
   products. The aim of this work was to culture diatom (microalgae) in a
   closed system by sealing the reactor rim tightly with very cheap priced
   and used plastic bubble wrap material which is generally discarded in a
   lodging and transportation of goods. To optimize it, different plastic
   wraps discarded from a plastic industry were tested first for their
   permeability to gases and impermeability to water loss. It was found
   that among different varieties of plastic bubble wraps, low density
   polyethylene (LDPE) bubble wrap material which was used to seal glass
   containers as photobioreactors allowed harvest of maximum Diafuel (37%),
   lipid (35 mugmL-1), highest cell count (1152 * 102cells mL-1), maximum
   CO2absorbance (0.084) with almost no water loss and nutrient uptake for
   40 days of experiments. This was due to its permeability to gases and
   impermeability to water. To check usability of such LDPE bubble wrap on
   other microalgae it was therefore tested on the red-green
   microalgaeHaematococcus pluvialis, which showed scope to be scaled up
   for astaxanthin production using discarded bubble wrap packing material.
   This study thus would open up a new way for decreasing plastic disposal
   and with reuse for sustainable development and application of diatom in

AB The paramount challenge in economically workable microalgal biodiesel
   production is the selection of a competent catalyst to improve the fatty
   acid methyl ester yield with desirable fatty acid composition. Though
   countless researchers have explored different homogeneous and
   heterogeneous catalysts to improve the transesterification efficacy,
   achieving greater biodiesel production from the neutral lipids of the
   microalgal consortium using a statistical tool, response surface
   methodology is scarce. Thus, the present study applied Response surface
   methodology to statistically analyze the biodiesel production from the
   neutral lipids of the indigenousCoelastrella-Nannochloropsisconsortium
   (CNC) on the way to commercial feasibility. Onset of the study, the
   neutral lipids and acid value of the CNC were determined to be 18.74%
   and 2.73%, respectively. The transesterification of the neutral lipids
   of CNC was optimized through the coded factors in the RSM for various
   reaction parameters as combined influence viz., (i) Catalyst dose:
   methanol volume, (ii) Catalyst dose: reaction time; (iii) Catalyst dose:
   reaction temperature, (iv) Time: temperature, (v) time: methanol volume,
   (vi) temperature: methanol volume. Based on the ANOVA, coefficient
   determination, 2% KOH, 2 h time, 70°C temperature, and 9 mL methanol
   volume were ascertained to be optimal values to accomplish 92% biodiesel
   production. Further, the biodiesel has desirable palmitic, palmitoleic,
   stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids, with palmitic acid as the
   prevalent fatty acid contributing 16-18%. In addition, the tested fuel
   properties of CNC biodiesel satisfy international biodiesel standards.

U1 26
U2 254
AB Energy is a major driving force for the economic development. Due to the
   scarcity of fossil fuels and negative impact on the environment, it is
   important to develop renewable and sustainable energy sources for
   humankind. Microalgae as the primary feedstock for biodiesel has shown
   great application potential. However, lipid yield from microalgae is
   limited by the upstream cost, which restrain the realization of
   large-scale biofuel production. The modification of lipid-rich
   microalgae cell has become the focus over the last few decades to
   improve the lipid content and productivity of microalgae. Carbon is a
   vital nutrient that regulates the growth and metabolism of microalgae.
   Different carbon sources are assimilated by microalgae cells via
   different pathways. Inorganic carbon sources are mainly used through the
   CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), while organic carbon sources are
   absorbed by microalgae mainly through the Pentose Phosphate (PPP)
   Pathway and the Embden-Meyerhof-Pranas (EMP) pathway. Therefore, the
   addition of carbon source has a significant impact on the production of
   microalgae biomass and lipid accumulation. In this paper, mechanisms of
   lipid synthesis and carbon uptake of microalgae were introduced, and the
   effects of different carbon conditions (types, concentrations, and
   addition methods) on lipid accumulation in microalgal biomass production
   and biodiesel production were comprehensively discussed. This review
   also highlights the recent advances in microalgae lipid cultivation with
   large-scale commercialization and the development prospects of biodiesel
   production. Current challenges and constructive suggestions are proposed
   on cost-benefit concerns in large-scale production of microalgae
   biodiesel.

AB Concerted efforts in the field of bioenergy are driving dynamic studies
   for the production of microalgae-based biogas systems. Its ability to
   recycle residual nutrients and carbon dioxide (CO2) products of the
   anaerobic effluent reflected anaerobic digestion as the most sustainable
   means for renewable energy generation in microalgae. These measures will
   aid to lessen the effect of greenhouse gas emissions and increase the
   prospects for the application of microalgae biomass in the field of food
   and agricultural technology, medicine, and bioengineering, contributing
   to the sustainability of the industries. To begin with, the experimental
   limitations associated with the cultivation of microalgae biomass need
   to be resolved. In spite of the extensive studies conducted in the field
   of bioengineering, problems related to culture optimization, high
   building and operation costs remained persistent. This review
   highlighted vital points of microalgae-based bioprocesses that require
   several advancements in order to improve the prospects of anaerobic
   digestion and discover novel renewable energy products. Coupled
   anaerobic digestion with microalgae cultivation systems requires
   intensive research as a distinct bioenergy generation process to uphold

AB Microalgae are considered a promising feedstock for biorefineries given
   that their chemical composition - rich in carbohydrate and lipid - can
   be directed towards the co-production of various value-added fuels and
   chemicals. Production of microalgal biomass for biorefinery purposes
   requires the identification and establishment of optimal cultivation
   systems, a crucial yet complicated task due to the numerous factors
   (e.g. media composition, light, temperature) that simultaneously
   regulate biomass growth and intracellular composition. Modelling these
   biological processes, taking into account a single or multiple
   growth-limiting factors, offers a valuable tool to simulate, design and
   optimise the dynamics of microalgae cultivation. This review provides an
   overview of existing models developed to describe microalgal growth
   processes at the macroscopic scale (also termed black-box models) and
   discusses their formulation in detail. The black-box kinetic modelling
   frameworks are compiled into single-factor (6 formulations) and
   multiple-factor (32 formulations - further divided into non-interactive,
   additive, and interactive) growth kinetic models, as reported in more
   than 80 studies, for the prediction of biomass growth as a function of
   major operational factors such as media composition (e.g. nutrient
   concentration) and environmental factors (e.g. transient light and
   temperature). In addition, the review focuses on those models that
   further account for the production dynamics of two microalgal
   intracellular products with renowned potential as biorefinery
   substrates: carbohydrate and lipid molecules. Models of microalgal
   cultivation dynamics offer a robust engineering tool to understand the
   natural yet complex responses of microalgae to their growing environment
   and can help - if used appropriately - to optimise microalgae
   cultivation and increase the economic viability and sustainability of
   microalgal systems.

AB Energy is the mainstay of modern industry and the motivity of
   sustainable development for national economy. The bioenergy, as one form
   of renewable energy with wide resource, its application could not only
   relax the energy crises but also restrain the environmental pollution.
   Many species of microalgae are known for their high content of lipids in
   the cells, and can be used for production of biodiesel; some microalgae
   are able to accumulate a lot of hydrocarbon, which can be made into
   gasoline or diesel, and some of them can produce hydrogen in some case.
   With the advantages of easy cultivation, fast growth, high biomass
   production and richness in lipids and hydrocarbon, microalgae is an
   important resource of bioenergy. Consequently, governments of many
   countries, scientists and enterprisers have paid much attention to the
   research and development of algal renewable energy. This paper
   summarized the present progress of using microalgae to produce hydrogen,
   hydrocarbon and lipids. The main problems and strategies for renewable
   energy production by microalgae were discussed, and the prospect of
   research and development of renewable energy production by microalgae in

   technological advancement of renewable energy resources, algae are
   presently believed as most adaptable feedstock materials for bioenergy
   production. Algae has a high fixation rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide
   which supports to fast growth rate with high productivity per unit area
   in the form of renewable algal biomass. The present article aims to

AB An interest in biodiesel as an alternative fuel for diesel engines has
   been increasing because of the issue of petroleum depletion and
   environmental concerns related to massive carbon dioxide emissions.
   Researchers are strongly driven to pursue the next generation of
   vegetable oil-based biodiesel. Oleaginous microalgae are considered to
   be a promising alternative oil source. To commercialize microalgal
   biodiesel, cost reductions in oil extraction and downstream biodiesel
   conversion are stressed. Herein, starting from an investigation of oil
   extraction from wet microalgae, a review is conducted of
   transesterification using enzymes, homogeneous and heterogeneous
   catalysts, and yield enhancement by ultrasound, microwave, and
   supercritical process. In particular, there is a focus on direct
   transesterification as a simple and energy efficient process that omits
   a separate oil extraction step and utilizes wet microalgal biomass;
   however, it is still necessary to consider issues such as the
   purification of microalgal oils and upgrading of biodiesel properties.

AB Exploiting microalgae as feedstock for biofuel production is a growing
   field of research and application, but there remain challenges related
   to industrial viability and economic sustainability. A solution to the
   water requirements of industrial-scale production is the use of
   wastewater as a growth medium. Considering the variable quality and
   contaminant loads of wastewater, algal feedstock would need to have
   broad tolerance and resilience to fluctuating wastewater conditions
   during growth. As a first step in targeting strains for growth in
   wastewater, our study isolated microalgae from wastewater habitats,
   including urban stormwater-ponds and a municipal wastewater-treatment
   system, to assess growth, fatty acids and metal tolerance under
   standardized conditions. Stormwater ponds in particular have widely
   fluctuating conditions and metal loads, so microalgae from this type of
   environment may have desirable traits for growth in wastewater.
   Forty-three algal strains were isolated in total, including several
   strains from natural habitats. All strains, with the exception of one
   cyanobacterial strain, are members of the Chlorophyta, including several
   taxa commonly targeted for biofuel production. Isolates were identified
   using taxonomic and 18S rRNA sequence methods, and the fastest growing
   strains with ideal fatty acid profiles for biodiesel production
   includedScenedesmusandDesmodesmusspecies (Growth rate (d-1) >1). All
   isolates in a small, but diverse taxonomic group of test-strains were
   tolerant of copper at wastewater-relevant concentrations. Overall, more
   than half of the isolated strains, particularly those from stormwater
   ponds, show promise as candidates for biofuel feedstock.

AB The search for a balance between the energy-related challenges of the
   future and providing nutritional security has resulted in the
   development of a market for biofuels of successive generations. The
   larger their portion in biofuel production, the less the prices of
   agricultural products will increase. The use of algae, cyanobacteria and
   aquatic plants in the production of liquid fuels is an alternative. The
   aim of this study was to determine the effect of thermal hydrolysis on
   degradation of polysaccharides contained in biomass of
   cyanobacteriaArthrospira platensisand to assess the effectiveness of
   ethanol production from preconditioned biomass. The study is aimed at
   the selection of the most advantageous parameters of thermochemical
   hydrolysis to reach the experiment variant with the best effects, degree
   of polysaccharide degradation and effectiveness of alcohol fermentation.
   The experiment was divided into two stages; in stage I, the possibility
   of obtaining fermentable sugars by hydrothermal and chemical treatment
   of the substrate was tested. Stage II involved an assessment of the
   effectiveness of the pretreatment methods to produce bioethanol in
   alcohol fermentation. Yeast used in industrial ethanol production
   -Saccharomyces cerevisiaeAs4 - was used in the alcohol fermentation. The
   results have shown that the temperature of 150°C was the most beneficial
   for the process of thermohydrolysis, and the mash in the
   microwave-heated sample contained the highest concentration of alcohol
   (0.97 g/l), which is 98% more than in the control mash and 37% more than
   in the conventionally heated sample.

AB Background: Microalgae have shown clear advantages for the production of
   biofuels compared with energy crops. Apart from their high growth rates
   and substantial lipid/triacylglycerol yields, microalgae can grow in
   wastewaters (animal, municipal and mining wastewaters) efficiently
   removing their primary nutrients (C, N, and P), heavy metals and
   micropollutants, and they do not compete with crops for arable lands.
   However, fundamental barriers to the industrial application of
   microalgae for biofuel production still include high costs of removing
   the algae from the water and the water from the algae which can account
   for up to 30-40% of the total cost of biodiesel production. Algal
   biofilms are becoming increasingly popular as a strategy for the
   concentration of microalgae, making harvesting/dewatering easier and
   cheaper. Results: We have isolated and characterized a number of natural
   microalgal biofilms from freshwater, saline lakes and marine habitats.
   Structurally, these biofilms represent complex consortia of unicellular
   and multicellular, photosynthetic and heterotrophic inhabitants, such as
   cyanobacteria, microalgae, diatoms, bacteria, and fungi. Biofilm #52 was
   used as feedstock for bioenergy production. Dark fermentation of its
   biomass byEnterobacter cloacaeDT-1 led to the production of 2.4 mol of
   H2/mol of reduced sugar. The levels and compositions of saturated,
   monosaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in Biofilm #52 were
   target-wise modified through the promotion of the growth of selected
   individual photosynthetic inhabitants. Photosynthetic components
   isolated from different biofilms were used for tailoring of novel
   biofilms designed for (i) treatment of specific types of wastewaters,
   such as reverse osmosis concentrate, (ii) compositions of total fatty
   acids with a new degree of unsaturation and (iii) bio-flocculation and
   concentration of commercial microalgal cells. Treatment of different
   types of wastewaters with biofilms showed a reduction in the
   concentrations of key nutrients, such as phosphates, ammonia, nitrates,
   selenium and heavy metals. Conclusions: This multidisciplinary study
   showed the new potential of natural biofilms, their individual
   photosynthetic inhabitants and assembled new algal/cyanobacterial
   biofilms as the next generation of bioenergy feedstocks which can grow
   using wastewaters as a cheap source of key nutrients.

AB This review proposes a new bioremediation method based on the diverse
   functionalities of algae. A greenway for cleansing wastewater is more
   ecologically friendly and environmentally sustainable than prior methods
   with other bacteria. New bioremediation technology employing algae and
   cyanobacteria for the removal of a wide range of organic contaminants is
   reasonable and has great potential. The prevalence of organic
   contaminants in aquatic habitats may endanger the health and well-being
   of several marine creatures. Agriculture, industry, and household trash
   are just a few of the human-caused sources of organic pollutants that
   contaminate waterways around the world. Before wastewater can be
   released into waterways, it must be cleaned. Algae-based wastewater
   treatment systems are becoming increasingly popular because of their
   environmental sustainability and lack of secondary pollutants. According
   to the kind of pollutant, the physicochemical properties of wastewater,
   and the algal species, algae and cyanobacteria can absorb and accumulate
   a wide spectrum of organic pollutants at different rates. In addition,
   phytoremediation is a cost-effective alternative to conventional
   treatments for degrading organic contaminants. Phycoremediationally
   produced algal biomass may also be an important part of the bioenergy
   value chain. This article focuses on microalgae and cyanobacteria
   species, which may remove many organic contaminants from water systems.

AB Fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas, remain the main
   source of global energy supply. Not only the storage capacity is
   limited, but also the use of the ecological environment causes great
   damage, a serious threat to human life safety. Microalgae biodiesel
   receives extensive attention due to its biodegradable and carbon-neutral
   green energy characteristics, which is used to reduce or replace the use
   of these fossil fuels. Because of the slow growth of microalgae, low
   lipid content and low biodiesel production, people begin to study ways
   to improve the growth and lipid production of microalgae and catalytic
   conversion of biodiesel. In this paper, the research progress of the
   whole process from microalgae culture to microalgae oil production to
   microalgae catalytic conversion of biodiesel in recent years is
   reviewed. The efficient growth and oil production of microalgae, the
   catalytic conversion methods of microalgae biodiesel and the application
   prospects of microalgae biodiesel are discussed and summarized.
   Specifically, this review critically discusses: (i) The current
   development status of microalgae culture and microalgae biodiesel; (ii)
   Cultivation methods for efficient growth and oil production of
   microalgae under different stress conditions; (iii) The effects of
   different types of catalysts and catalytic methods on the yield of
   biodiesel; (iv) Environmental problems and economic value of the whole
   process of microalgae biodiesel production; (v) Current limitations and
   future research directions in the field of microalgae biodiesel. Studies
   show that regulating light, temperature, pH, nutrients, etc. can improve
   the growth and oil production of microalgae, in which the addition of
   anions and cations can change the physiological, biochemical and
   metabolic mechanisms of microalgae. At present, a large number of
   genetic modification and metabolic regulation engineering technologies
   are applied to microalgae oil production. They have precise control of
   the targeting mechanism in cells to induce increased lipid accumulation.
   The two-stage culture model can simultaneously increase biomass and
   lipid content. The addition of homogeneous, heterogeneous, biological
   enzymes and nano-catalysts accelerates the conversion efficiency and
   improves the yield of biodiesel. The catalytic yield of several magnetic
   nano-catalysts studied is as high as > 98%. The supercritical method and
   ionic liquid method are favored by everyone because they do not use
   catalysts to reduce environmental pollution. In situ transesterification
   replaces the traditional two-step transesterification method to reduce
   energy consumption and cumbersome steps. Hydrothermal liquefaction
   method can directly convert wet algae biomass into biofuels without
   drying at high temperatures and pressure and in the presence of water.
   However, the current high-cost economic problems in the production of
   microalgae biodiesel and the environmental problems caused by the
   addition of catalysts need to further study the efficient and low-cost
   microalgae culture methods and new environmentally friendly catalysts
   and catalytic methods to improve the yield of microalgae biodiesel, to
   realize the commercial production of microalgae biodiesel as soon as
   possible.

AB Problem Statement: The research on the production of biodiesel has
   increased significantly in recent years because of the need for an
   alternative fuel which endows with biodegradability, low toxicity and
   renewability. Plant oils, animal fats, microalgal oils and waste
   products such as animal rendering, fish processing waste and cooking
   oils have been employed as feedstocks for biodiesel production. In order
   to design an economically and environmentally sustainable biodiesel
   production process, a proper understanding of the factors affecting the
   process and their relative importance is necessary. Approach: A
   comprehensive review of the literature on the subject of biodiesel
   production was carried out. Traditionally biodiesel has been produced
   using either acid or base catalysts. The multi-step purification of end
   products, wastewater treatment and energy demand of the conventional
   process has lead to search for alternative option for production of
   biodiesel. The use the enzyme lipase as a biocatalyst for the
   transesterification reaction step in biodiesel production has been
   extensively investigated. Lipase is produced by all living organisms and
   can be used intracellularly or extracellularly. Conclusion: To date, the
   most popular microbes used for their lipases have been filamentous fungi
   and recombinant bacteria. A summary of lipases used in
   transesterification and their optimum operating conditions is provided.
   In addition to the choice of lipase employed, factors which make the
   transesterification process feasible and ready for commercialization
   are: enzyme modification, the selection of feedstock and alcohol, use of
   common solvents, pretreatment of the lipase, alcohol to oil molar ratio,
   water activity/content and reaction temperature. Optimization of these
   parameters is necessary in order to reduce the cost of biodiesel
   production. Use of no/low cost waste materials as feedstocks will have
   double environmental benefits by reducing the environmental pollution
   potential of the wastes and producing an environmentally friendly fuel.

AB Global increases in the generation of waste streams, including liquid,
   gaseous, and solid waste, have been posing serious challenges for waste
   management as a result of their potential impacts on receiving
   environments and climate change. The conversion of waste streams into
   useful bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts through recycling and/or
   recovery has been presented as a promising alternative. Coupling the
   bioremediation of waste streams with microalgae-based biofuel
   production, offers an alternative strategy to achieve waste-to-biofuel
   and bioenergy. A group of unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes,
   microalgae require relatively simple nutrients and inorganic carbon
   sources to support their growth, while accumulating several biofuel
   precursors, such as starch or storage lipids. This review summarizes the
   current approaches to microalgal biomass production using waste streams,
   including waste-water; waste or CO2-enriched gas (flue gas and biogas);
   waste organics (i.e., crude glycerol); and waste heat, as well as the
   primary common operational challenges and corresponding mitigation
   strategies involved in cultivation approaches. Moreover, microalgal
   metabolic pathways supporting the biosynthesis of energy-rich molecules
   such as triacylglycerides (TAG) and starch are discussed. Metabolic
   constraints and potential approaches for the enhancement of microalgal
   TAG accumulation are systematically and critically analyzed.

AB Biodiesel has been receiving considerable attention as an alternative
   energy source over the last decade. Conventionally, biodiesel is
   produced by transesterification of lipid and alcohol, with or without
   the aid of catalysts. Due to the presence of multiple phases during the
   catalytic reaction, the mass transfer between reactants and catalysts,
   as well as the type of catalyst used are the two major factors that
   should be considered during the design of the reactor applied for the
   targeted conversion. Most efforts in this area focused on the selection
   of effective catalysts (e.g., homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous
   catalysts, enzymes) for biodiesel conversion via transesterification.
   The tests are regularly conducted on batch mode and the optimization of
   the operating conditions was done. However, to scale up the biodiesel
   production, many researchers utilized continuous-flow regime to
   continuously convert lipids to biodiesel with preferable process design
   to solve the problems encountered during continuous operation. This
   review is aimed at providing the knowledge and updated information on
   recent advances of the continuous-flow biodiesel production technology.
   This article presents and critically discusses the advantages and
   limitations of using catalyzed and non-catalyzed transesterification in
   conventional continuous-flow reactors and those assisted by
   supercritical conditions, membrane reactors, ultrasound, microwave, and
   other special techniques. Several newly developed processes, such as
   oscillatory flow reactor (OFR), microchannel reactors, laminar flow
   reactor-separator, liquid-liquid film reactor, which could minimize mass
   transfer resistance and improve biodiesel conversion are also presented.
   Finally, updates on conversion technologies for lipids from oleaginous
   microalgae (potential third-generation oil feedstock) to biodiesel and
   reviews on commercial continuous-flow biodiesel conversion technologies
   are provided.

AB Algal biofuels represent one of the most promising means of sustainably
   replacing liquid fuels. However, significant challenges remain before
   alga-based fuels become competitive with fossil fuels. One of the
   largest challenges is the ability to harvest the algae in an economical
   and low-energy manner. In this article, we describe the isolation of a
   bacterial strain, Bacillus sp. strain RP1137, which can rapidly
   aggregate several algae that are candidates for biofuel production,
   including a Nannochloropsis sp. This bacterium aggregates algae in a
   pH-dependent and reversible manner and retains its aggregation ability
   after paraformaldehyde fixation, opening the possibility for reuse of
   the cells. The optimal ratio of bacteria to algae is described, as is
   the robustness of aggregation at different salinities and temperatures.
   Aggregation is dependent on the presence of calcium or magnesium ions.
   The efficiency of aggregation of Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 is
   between 70 and 95% and is comparable to that obtained by other means of
   harvest; however, the rate of harvest is fast, with aggregates forming
   in 30 s.

AB Biogas generation is the least complex technology to transform
   microalgae biomass into bioenergy. Since hydrolysis has been pointed out
   as the rate limiting stage of anaerobic digestion, the main challenge
   for an efficient biogas production is the optimization of cell wall
   disruption/hydrolysis. Among all tested pretreatments, enzymatic
   treatments were demonstrated not only very effective in
   disruption/hydrolysis but they also revealed the impact of microalgae
   macromolecular composition in the anaerobic process. Although
   carbohydrates have been traditionally recognized as the polymers
   responsible for the low microalgae digestibility, protease addition
   resulted in the highest organic matter solubilization and the highest
   methane production. However, protein solubilization during the
   pretreatment can result in anaerobic digestion inhibition due to the
   release of large amounts of ammonium nitrogen. The possible solutions to
   overcome these negative effects include the reduction of protein biomass
   levels by culturing the microalgae in low nitrogen media and the use of
   ammonia tolerant anaerobic inocula. Overall, this review is intended to
   evidence the relevance of microalgae proteins in different stages of
   anaerobic digestion, namely hydrolysis and methanogenesis.

AB The modern world is highly dependent on energy. Biodiesel is recognized
   as a green and alternative renewable diesel fuel, and Brazil is the
   world's third largest producer of biodiesel, which in this country is
   mainly produced from soybeans. As the demand for biodiesel is increasing
   due to the increasing use of transportation fuel, it is advisable to
   look for other sources that would not need a vast cropland. Recently,
   microalgae have emerged as a source than can play the dual role of
   bioremediation of wastewater and generation of biomass for biodiesel
   production. This paper focuses on the feasibility of utilizing
   wastewater to cultivate algae for the production of biodiesel in Brazil.
   By using only domestic wastewater from 40% of Brazilian municipalities,
   the production of biodiesel would increase by 21.4%. Moreover, the use
   of wastewater treatment becomes an economically attractive alternative
   as the revenue from selling biodiesel overcomes the production costs by
   at least 10%. As a result, Brazil could easily increase its current
   biodiesel production and simultaneously amazingly improve its index of
   sanitation.

AB Microalgae are promising alternatives to mitigate atmospheric CO2owing
   to their fast growth rates, resilience in the face of adversity and
   ability to produce a wide range of products, including food, feed
   supplements, chemicals, and biofuels. However, to fully harness the
   potential of microalgae-based carbon capture technology, further
   advancements are required to overcome the associated challenges and
   limitations, particularly with regards to enhancing CO2solubility in the
   culture medium. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the
   biological carbon concentrating mechanism and highlights the current
   approaches, including species selection, optimization of hydrodynamics,
   and abiotic components, aimed at improving the efficacy of CO2solubility
   and biofixation. Moreover, cutting-edge strategies such as gene
   mutation, bubble dynamics and nanotechnology are systematically outlined
   to elevate the CO2biofixation capacity of microalgal cells. The review
   also evaluates the energy and economic feasibility of using microalgae
   for CO2bio-mitigation, including challenges and prospects for future
   development.

AB Microalgae have been positioned as excellent models for producing new
   sources of energy (biofuels and biohydrogen). Some investigations in
   these biological models have been directed to know if the enzymes
   ferredoxin (FDX) and hydrogenase (HYD) are involved in the algae
   producing different concentrations of molecular hydrogen (H2). To date,
   little is known about the concomitant transcriptional regulation of both
   enzymes during H2 evolution in algae. In this research, we evaluated the
   relative expression of hdy and fdx genes during the evolution of H2 in
   three microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus obliquus, and
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) in N-deprived anaerobic cultures in the
   presence of Fe, and 12:24 and 24:24 h dark:light cycles. We also
   detected structural differences in the enzymes. The 3D modeling
   indicated that the 3D structure of HYD and FDX are conserved in most
   algal genera, and the results of our grouping according to the aa
   characteristics of the proteins showed two grouping trends: One,
   according to the algae's phylogenetic classification, and another one
   according to the species-specific enzyme's characteristics, and the
   grouping could perhaps be more influenced by the algae's ability to
   produce H2. The three microalgae species reached maximum H2 accumulation
   values in 24h:24 h dark:light conditions in Fe-supplemented media (4.2 
   0.12 mL L-1 in C. vulgaris, 3.9  0.10 mL L-1 in S. obliquus, and 4.5 
   0.10 mL L-1 in C. reinhardtii), and the highest global relative
   expression of hyd and fdx genes was reached during the first hour of
   exposure to light, which suggests concomitant expression of both enzymes
   at the beginning of H2 production. The behavior of the expression of the
   hyd and fdx genes in these algal species proved to be similar between
   species. A better understanding of the concomitant regulation of both
   enzymes could lay the groundwork for the future use of both enzymes to
   improve H2 yields in microalgae.

AB Biofuel production using cyanobacteria aims to maintain the
   sustainability of an ecosystem with minimum impact on the environment,
   unlike fossil fuels, which cause havoc on the environment. The
   application of biofuel as an alternative energy source will not only
   help in maintaining a clean environment and improving air quality but
   also decrease harmful organic matter content from aquatic bodies.
   Cyanobacteria are valuable sources of many novel bioactive compounds,
   such as lipids and natural dyes, with potential commercial implications.
   One of the advantages of cyanobacteria is that their biochemical
   constituents can be modified by altering the source of nutrients and
   growth conditions. Careful changes in growth media and environmental
   conditions altering the quality and quantity of the biochemicals and
   yield capacity have been discussed and analyzed. In the present review,
   the challenges and successes achieved to date in the commercial
   production of biofuel and its application in the transportation industry
   are discussed. The authors also focus on different types of feedstocks
   obtained from biomass, especially from cyanobacterial species. This
   review also discusses the selection of appropriate cyanobacterial
   species with merits and demerits in the post-harvesting process. In sum,
   the current review provides insight into the use of organic bioresources
   to maintain a sustainable environment.

   paper presents a brief review on the main conversion processes of
   microalgae becoming energy. Since microalgae have high water content,
   not all biomass energy conversion processes can be applied. By using
   thermochemical processes, oil and gas can be produced, and by using
   biochemical processes, ethanol and biodiesel can be produced. The
   properties of the microalgae product are almost similar to those of
   offish and vegetable oils, and therefore, it can be considered as a
   substitute of fossil oil.

AB In the present study, 9 native microalgae consortia were investigated
   for their biomass potential in both low strength rural sector
   wastewater, RSW (COD=310.46 mg L-1; NO3-N=9.8 mg L-1; TDP=26.89 mg L-1;
   TAN=10.1 mg L-1) and high strength livestock wastewater, LSW (COD=2940
   mg L-1; NO3-N=75 mg L-1; TDP=200 mg L-1; TAN=161 mg L-1). In LSW,
   maximum biomass concentration of 1.93 g DW L-1 was recorded which was
   significantly higher than that in standard synthetic media BG11 (1.17 g
   DW L-1) and RSW (0.78 g DW L-1). By the end of 12 day batch culture, all
   the native consortia showed 80-100% reduction in nutrient from the
   tested wastewaters under controlled conditions (temperature: 251°C,
   light intensity: 50-60 mol m-2 s-1 and dark-light cycle of 12:12 h).
   Comparative growth of algae in RSW and LSW suggest that different types
   of wastewater could result in different nutrient removal kinetics and
   growth potential of algae. The biochemical characterization of the best
   performing consortium, PA6 (C0.5H7.8O0.5N0.7) revealed that it was rich
   in protein (54%) followed by lipids (31%) and carbohydrates (10%). The
   estimation of theoretical methane potential (0.79 m3 kg VS-1) suggested
   that PA6 has better prospects of biogas generation. Hence, this
   particular consortium could be utilized for reducing the water pollution
   levels and generating feedstock for biofuels production. However,
   challenges associated with scale up and continuous operation under real
   conditions need to be evaluated and addressed.

AB The scenario probed carbon bio-fixation and lipid accumulation in
   Coccomyxa subellipsoidea with triethanolamine (TEA) CO2 absorbent
   manipulation. The results stated that CO2 bio-fixation (691.9 mg/L/d),
   CO2 utilization efficiency (57.84%), CO2 bio-fixation amount (3.86 g),
   biomass (2.58 g/L), and lipid accumulation (232.30 mg/L/d) in C.
   subellipsoidea with 100 mg/L TEA batch manipulation were separately
   1.28-, 1.28-, 1.26-, 1.26-, and 1.72-fold more than that without TEA
   management. TEA fed-batch manipulation further augmented carbon fixation
   and the fixed carbon conversion into lipid with the maximum
   instantaneous CO2 fixation rate (1065.9 mg/L/d) and lipid productivity
   (538.7 mg/L/d) that were 1.97- and 3.98-fold more than that without TEA
   manipulation case. TEA manipulation also heightened the proportions of
   C16-C18 fatty acids (over 89%) and mono-unsaturated C18:1 (approximate
   40.85%) which were commendable for high-quality biofuels-making. Such
   virtues were attributed to that TEA balanced pH fluctuation, converted
   CO2 into purposive HCO3- species, modulated glycolysis and TCA cycle to
   discharge appreciable energy, alleviated oxidative stress to block
   oxidative attack on lipids, and functioned as precursors to collectively
   boost CO2 sequestration and lipid accumulation in C. subellipsoidea. The
   outcomes were expected to provide exemplifications in developing win-win
   strategy for CO2 sequestration and lipid production by microalgae.

AB Microalgae have been considered as a potential feedstock for biodiesel
   production, since its cultivation uses less land than other traditional
   oil crops and has a higher growth rate. A great challenge is a choice of
   an effective approach for microalgae biomass recovery and lipid
   extraction, since the scheduling of these practices are critical and
   require an economical and environment friendly route. Flocculation has
   evolved as an efficient and economic approach for harvesting microalgae
   biomass. This review discussed the recent progress of chemical
   flocculants including organic and inorganic, bio-flocculants and
   nanomaterials-based processes for biomass recovery. In addition, the
   present review describes modifications made in conventional methods for
   lipid extraction. Several pre-treatment methods such as mechanical,
   chemical integrated with various solvents and nanoparticles are vastly
   investigated for lipid extraction. Use of green solvents namely, ionic
   liquids, supercritical fluids and switchable solvents are also reviewed,
   with the focus on cleaner biofuel synthesis. Furthermore, the article
   discusses policies implemented for the advancement in biofuel
   production, major challenges and considers future directions in
   microalgae harvesting and lipid recovery processes. This is the first
   study that extensively compares the recent approaches for biomass and
   lipid recovery. The present work intended to serve a long-term
   adaptation of the innovative techniques for copious economic benefit.
   Thus, this review emphasizes on advanced techniques that influence the
   microalgae biomass separation and cellular disruption for proficient
   lipid removal from microalgae, which deliberates towards the development
   of sustainable microalgae biofuel and heighten the bio-economy strategy.

AB Chlorella vulgaris is commonly recognized as an interesting species for
   bioethanol production due to its carbohydrate content. Carbohydrates
   accumulation is often obtained under nitrogen starvation, which on the
   other hand may lead to a reduced biomass production. In this work, the
   effect of nitrogen limitation in a continuous system was assessed, with
   the aim of finding an optimal value where biomass productivity and
   carbohydrate content are well balanced. The effect of light intensity
   was also investigated, and it was highlighted that in a continuous
   system light stress is the main variable affecting the carbohydrate
   content and productivity. It was also evidenced that increasing the
   residence time is a way to boost nitrogen starvation: the biomass yield
   on nitrogen noticeably changes with the residence time, thus modifying
   the elemental composition of the microalgal biomass, and resulting in an
   accumulation of carbohydrates.

AB Microalgal biomass as a feedstock for biogas production is linked to the
   parameters biomass productivity and biogas yield. Besides an easy-to-use
   strain for anaerobic digestion, the photobioreactor (PBR) design is
   important. A microalgae strain selection revealed Eustigmatos magnus
   (SAG 36.89) as the most promising strain yielding an average of 100 mg
   total suspended solids (TSS) L-1 day-1. The strain was tested in
   cost-effective sleevebag-PBR-systems of 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm diameter
   facing the light from the front or laterally. Highest mean productivity
   on a volumetric basis was measured in PBRs with the lowest diameter (104
   and 117 mg L-1 day-1). The highest productivity per m-2 was achieved in
   10 cm PBRs with front light configuration (9.35 g TSS m-2 day-1). The
   lateral light configuration of 10 cm PBRs had positive aspects such as
   the lowest mean water demand to produce 1 kg TSS (481 L-1 kg-1) and the
   lowest mean energy demand for medium separation of 1 kg TSS (106 Wh).
   The concentrated microalgal biomass was then subjected to
   ultrasonication and thermal pre-treatment (90°C and 120°C) and tested in
   BMP tests. Mesophilic anaerobic mono-digestion of untreated microalgae
   biomass led to a methane (CH4) yield of 343 L-1 kg-1 volatile solids
   (VS). Thermal pre-treatment at 120°C resulted in significantly increased
   CH4 yields of 430 L-1 kg-1 VS. As thermal pre-treatment can be easily
   installed nearby a biogas plant it could be an interesting option for AD
   of microalgal biomass with only little investment.

AB Due to their extensive application potential in biopharmaceuticals,
   nutraceuticals, and renewable energy, microalgae have recently drawn
   considerable attention worldwide. Biofuels, bioactive medicinal
   products, and food ingredients are made from microalgae, a renewable,
   sustainable, and economic resource. A number of microalgae species have
   shown remarkable pharmacological and biological properties that have
   made them useful as value-added products. The cost, renewable nature,
   and environmental concerns of biofuels make them a perfect substitute
   for liquid fossil fuels. As well as carbohydrates, lipids, and other
   bioactive metabolites, microalgae convert atmospheric CO2 into useful
   products. There are some limitations and challenges to overcome before
   microalgae can be upgraded from pilot stage to industrial scale, though
   they are feasible sources of bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals in
   general. Enhancing microalgae growth rate and product synthesis is the
   most challenging and crucial issue, as is dewatering algae cultures,
   pretreating biomass, and optimizing fermentation processes. Various
   bioactive compounds as well as microalgae advantages for biofuel
   production are discussed in this review.

AB Microbial oils are considered as alternative to vegetable oils or animal
   fats as biodiesel feedstock. Microalgae and oleaginous yeast are the
   main candidates of microbial oil producers' community. However,
   biodiesel synthesis from these sources is associated with high cost and
   process complexity. The traditional transesterification method includes
   several steps such as biomass drying, cell disruption, oil extraction
   and solvent recovery. Therefore, direct transesterification or in situ
   transesterification, which combines all the steps in a single reactor,
   has been suggested to make the process cost effective. Nevertheless, the
   process is not applicable for large-scale biodiesel production having
   some difficulties such as high water content of biomass that makes the
   reaction rate slower and hurdles of cell disruption makes the efficiency
   of oil extraction lower. Additionally, it requires high heating energy
   in the solvent extraction and recovery stage. To resolve these
   difficulties, this review suggests the application of antimicrobial
   peptides and high electric fields to foster the microbial cell wall
   disruption.

AB The conversion of microalgae lipids and cyanobacteria carbohydrates into
   biofuels appears to be a promising source of renewable energy. This
   requires a thorough understanding of their carbon metabolism, supported
   by mathematical models, in order to optimize biofuel production.
   However, unlike heterotrophic microorganisms that utilize the same
   substrate as sources of energy and carbon, photoautotrophic
   microorganisms require light for energy and CO2 as carbon source.
   Furthermore, they are submitted to permanent fluctuating light
   environments due to outdoor cultivation or mixing inducing a flashing
   effect. Although, modeling these nonstandard organisms is a major
   challenge for which classical tools are often inadequate, this step
   remains a prerequisite towards efficient optimization of outdoor biofuel
   production at an industrial scale.

AB Over the last decades, production of microalgae and cyanobacteria has
   been developed for several applications, including novel foods, cosmetic
   ingredients and more recently biofuel. The sustainability of these
   promising developments can be hindered by some constraints, such as
   water and nutrient footprints. This review surveys data on N2-fixing
   cyanobacteria for biomass production and ways to induce and improve the
   excretion of ammonium within cultures under aerobic conditions. The
   nitrogenase complex is oxygen sensitive. Nevertheless, nitrogen fixation
   occurs under oxic conditions due to cyanobacteria-specific
   characteristics. For instance, in some cyanobacteria, the vegetative
   cell differentiation in heterocytes provides a well-adapted anaerobic
   microenvironment for nitrogenase protection. Therefore, cell cultures of
   oxygenic cyanobacteria have been grown in laboratory and pilot
   photobioreactors (Dasgupta et al., 2010; Fontes et al., 1987; Moreno et
   al., 2003; Nayak & Das, 2013). Biomass production under diazotrophic
   conditions has been shown to be controlled by environmental factors such
   as light intensity, temperature, aeration rate, and inorganic carbon
   concentration, also, more specifically, by the concentration of
   dissolved oxygen in the culture medium. Currently, there is little
   information regarding the production of extracellular ammonium by
   heterocytous cyanobacteria. This review compares the available data on
   maximum ammonium concentrations and analyses the specific rate
   production in cultures grown as free or immobilized filamentous
   cyanobacteria. Extracellular production of ammonium could be coupled, as
   suggested by recent research on non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria, to that
   of other high value metabolites. There is little information available
   regarding the possibility for using diazotrophic cyanobacteria as
   cellular factories may be in regard of the constraints due to nitrogen
   fixation.

AB The imminent depletion of fossil fuels and the surging global demand for
   renewable energy have led to the search for nonconventional energy
   sources. After a few decades of trial and error, the world is now
   testing the sources of the third generation of fossil fuels, which
   contain for most parts microalgae. With more than 80% oil content, being
   adaptable in growth parameters and highly versatile, microalgae are
   highly promising sources of biofuels in the present time. The present
   article makes a sweeping attempt to highlight the various methods
   employed for cultivation of microalgae, techniques to harvest and
   extract biomass from huge algal cultures, as well as their downstream
   production and processing procedures. The advantages, limitations, and
   challenges faced by each of them have been described to some extent.
   Major concerns pertaining to biofuels are supposed to be their
   environmental sustainability and economic viability along with their
   cost effectiveness. This would require a great deal of empirical data on
   existing systems and a great deal of optimization to generate a more
   robust one. We have concluded our article with a SWOT analysis of using
   algae for biodiesel production in a tabulated form.

AB Global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels have spurred many
   efforts in the quest for finding renewable, alternative sources of
   fuels, such as biodiesel. Due to its auxiliary functions in areas such
   as carbon dioxide sequestration and wastewater treatment, the potential
   of microalgae as a feedstock for biodiesel production has attracted a
   lot of attention from researchers all over the world. Major improvements
   have been made from the upstream to the downstream aspects related to
   microalgae processing. One of the main concerns is the high cost
   associated with the production of biodiesel from microalgae, which
   includes drying of the biomass and the subsequent lipid extraction.
   These two processes can be circumvented by applying direct or in situ
   transesterification of the wet microalgae biomass, hence substantially
   reducing the cost. In situ transesterification is considered as a
   significant improvement to commercially produce biodiesel from
   microalgae. This review covers the methods used to extract lipids from
   microalgae and various in situ transesterification methods, focusing on
   recent developments related to the process. Nevertheless, more studies
   need to be conducted to further enhance the discussed in situ
   transesterification methods before implementing them on a commercial
   scale.

AB Depletion of fossil fuels at an alarming rate in past few decades in
   association with global warming has led to the search of an alternative
   fuel which could fulfill the demand of energy, worldwide. In addition to
   this, it should also be renewable, sustainable and eco-friendly.
   Biodiesel has emerged as one of the promising options for replacing
   conventional fuels. Numerous factors like renewability, non-toxicity,
   biodegradability, less pollutant emission when compared to conventional
   diesel are responsible for the overall acceptance of biodiesel as an
   alternative. It is usually produced from vegetable oil, animal fats,
   non-edible oil, waste cooking oil, and microorganisms (microalgae,
   yeasts etc.). The uses of these feedstock, especially non-edible oil,
   waste cooking oil, and oleaginous microorganisms are cost effective and
   gained considerable attention in research field. In this respect,
   numbers of research are done to investigate the better way of producing
   biodiesel as an alternative fuel. Accordingly, this review paper
   examines the latest technologies used for biodiesel production.

AB The rapid increase in worldwide population coupled with the increasing
   demand for fossil fuels has led to an increased urgency to develop
   sustainable sources of energy and chemicals from renewable resources.
   Using microorganisms to produce high-value chemicals and next-generation
   biofuels is one sustainable option and is the focus of much current
   research. Cyanobacteria are ideal platform organisms for chemical and
   biofuel production because they can be genetically engineered to produce
   a broad range of products directly from CO2, H2O, and sunlight, and
   require minimal nutrient inputs. The purpose of this review is to
   provide an overview on advances that have been or could be made to
   improve strains of cyanobacteria for industrial purposes. First, the
   benefits of using cyanobacteria as a platform for chemical and biofuel
   production are discussed. Next, an overview of cyanobacterial strain
   improvements by genetic engineering is provided. Finally, mutagenesis
   techniques to improve the industrial potential of cyanobacteria are
   described. Along with providing an overview on various areas of research
   that are currently being investigated to improve the industrial
   potential of cyanobacteria, this review aims to elucidate potential
   targets for future research involving cyanobacteria as an industrial
   microorganism.

AB BACKGROUND: Given the small size of microalgae, and the low biomass
   concentrations obtained in light-limited cultures, the cost of algae
   harvesting is a significant barrier to commercial-scale production of
   biofuel from algae. A downward- flow inclined gravity settler was
   evaluated for its effectiveness in dewatering the microalgae Scenedesmus
   dimorphus and Chlorella vulgaris. RESULTS: Experimental results showed
   that S. dimorphus can be concentrated up to 8-fold using a single
   settler stage, with a biomass recovery of 80%. Separation efficiency was
   independent of biomass concentration between 1 and 5 gdw L-1, suggesting
   that a two-stage sequential system of settlers may maximize biomass
   recovery and concentration effectively. Efficiency of separation of C.
   vulgaris was slightly lower than that of S. dimorphus, most likely due
   to the fact that S. dimorphus exist in aggregates of four or more cells
   and thus may settle more easily. CONCLUSION: The downward-flow inclined
   gravity settler demonstrated consistent results with 72% efficiency in
   biomass recovery and low operating costs. This separation system
   warrants further investigation at the industrial scale, for the
   harvesting of algae from dilute cell suspensions, with applications to
   biofuels.

AB The use of native microalgal strains, which are well adapted to local
   environmental conditions, for sustainable biofuels production has
   largely been marred by photonics-related challenges. To date, most
   photobioreactor systems make use of artificial sources of illumination
   thus increasing the overall costs of biomass production. Solar energy,
   although sustainable and cost-effective, is difficult to manage and
   control. It also contains other wavelengths which are detrimental to
   microalgae. Thus, this study sought to make use of spectral filters for
   optimal outdoor algaculture. Hence, solar energy was used in
   wastewater-mediated algaculture of native and importedChlorellasp. under
   blue, green, red and yellow coloured spectral filters. The
   nativeChlorellasp. had the highest growth rate of 0.892 d-1and 0.754
   d-1under green and blue coloured filters, respectively. In comparison,
   the importedChlorellastrain had a growth rate of 0.379 d-1and 0.267
   d-1under green and blue filters, respectively. Both strains produced
   high lipid yields under the blue coloured filter, with the native and
   importedChlorellastrains managing lipid yields of 41.87% dry cell weight
   (dcw) and 32.29% dcw, respectively. The nativeChlorellastrain also
   significantly lowered (p< 0.05) the levels of total nitrogen and
   ammonium from wastewater with removal efficiencies of 92.17% and 44.60%,
   respectively, whereas the importedChlorellastrain managed a removal
   efficiency of 80.81% total nitrogen and 26.10% ammonium under the blue
   coloured filter. The results indicate that light filtration technology
   can be used, sustainably, in the simultaneous algaculture of native
   strains and remediation of wastewater.

TI Strategies for lipid production improvement in microalgae as a biodiesel
   feedstock.

PY 2016
U1 0
U2 0
AB In response to the energy crisis, global warming, and climate changes,
   microalgae have received a great deal of attention as a biofuel
   feedstock. Due to a high lipid content in microalgal cells, microalgae
   present as a promising alternative source for the production of
   biodiesel. Environmental and culturing condition variations can alter
   lipid production as well as chemical compositions of microalgae.
   Therefore, application of the strategies to activate lipid accumulation
   opens the door for lipid overproduction in microalgae. Until now, many
   original studies regarding the approaches for enhanced microalgal lipid
   production have been reported in an effort to push forward the
   production of microalgal biodiesel. However, the current literature
   demonstrates fragmented information available regarding the strategies
   for lipid production improvement. From the systematic point of view, the
   review highlights the main approaches for microalgal lipid accumulation
   induction to expedite the application of microalgal biodiesel as an
   alternative to fossil diesel for sustainable environment. Of the several
   strategies discussed, the one that is most commonly applied is the
   design of nutrient (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) starvation
   or limitation. Other viable approaches such as light intensity,
   temperature, carbon dioxide, salinity stress, and metal influence can
   also achieve enhanced microalgal lipid production.

AB The world economic growth causes the excessive use of fossil fuels which
   are the main sources of environmental pollution and global warming due
   to the production of carbon dioxide and sulfur compounds. Microalgae
   biodiesel has been considered as a renewable and sustainable energy
   source and has the potential to be a suitable alternative to fossil
   fuels due to reduction of the emission of toxic gas to the atmosphere.
   Microalgae open a credible new path to biomass production as a
   sustainable material in biodiesel production. The study of genetic
   engineering of microalgae and biodiesel extraction as a major biofuel
   has received significant attention in recent years. There are a number
   of successive procedures for biodiesel production using microalgae,
   including obtaining the raw material or fuel required for industrial
   processes, which includes selection of sufficient microalga species,
   large-scale culture, collecting cells, extracting oil, and
   transesterification. In order to decrease the yield cost, there should
   be technological advancements and process improvement. The current study
   is a brief review of microalgae biodiesel production with the goal of
   replacing fossil fuel.

SO Chemosphere
VL 295

U1 1
U2 67
AB Sugarcane bagasse is an abundantly available agricultural waste having
   high potential that is still underutilized and mostly burnt as fuel.
   There are various processes available for bagasse utilization in
   improved ways and one such process is anaerobic digestion (AD) of
   bagasse for biogas production. The complex structure of biomass is
   recalcitrant to degradation and is a major hindrance for the anaerobic
   digestion, so different pretreatment methods are applied to deconstruct
   the bagasse for microbial digestion. In this review, different processes
   developed for the pretreatment of bagasse and their effect on biogas
   production have been extensively covered. Moreover, combination of
   pretreatment methods, co-digestion of bagasse with other waste (nitrogen
   rich or easily digestible) for enhanced biogas production and biomethane
   generation along with other value-added products has also been reviewed.
   The digestate contains a significant amount of organics with partial
   recovery of energy and products and is generated in huge amount that
   further creates disposal problem. Therefore, integration of digestate
   valorization with AD through gasification, pyrolysis, hydrothermal
   carbonization and use of microalgae for maximum recovery of energy and
   value-added products have also been evaluated. Thus, this review
   highlights major emerging area of research for improvement in bagasse
   based processes for enhanced biogas production along with digestate
   valorization to make the overall process economical and sustainable.

TI A sustainable vanadium bioremediation strategy from aqueous media by two
   potential green microalgae.
SO Environmental Pollution
VL 323
PY 2023
U1 1
U2 25
AB Globally, environmental concerns are rapidly growing due to increasing
   pollution levels. Vanadium is a hazardous heavy metal that poses health
   issues with an exposure concentration of about 2 ppm. It is regularly
   discharged by some industries and poses an environmental challenge.
   There are no sustainable green treatment methods for discharged
   effluents to mitigate vanadium threats to humans and the environment. In
   this study, the goal was to develop a green, sustainable method for
   removing vanadium and to utilize the produced biomass for biofuels, thus
   offsetting the treatment cost. MicroalgaeChlorella sorokinianaSU1
   andPicochlorum oklahomensiswere employed for vanadium (III) treatment.
   The maximum removal was 25.5 mg L-1with biomass and lipid yields of 3.0
   g L-1and 884.4 mg L-1respectively after 14 days of treatment. The
   vanadium removal capacity by microalgae was further enhanced up to 2-2.7
   folds while optimizing the key parameters, pH, and temperature before
   removing biomass from the liquid phase. FTIR is used to analyse the
   reactive groups in algal cell walls to confirm vanadium adsorption and
   to understand the dominant and quantitative interactions. Zeta potential
   analysis helps to find out the most suitable pH range to facilitate the
   ionic bonding of biomass and thus maximum vanadium adsorption. This
   study addresses regulating external factors for enhancing the removal
   performance during microalgal biomass harvesting, which significantly
   enhances the removal of vanadium (III) from the aqueous phase. This
   strategy aims to improve the removal efficiency of microalgal treatment
   at an industrial scale for the bioremediation of vanadium and other
   inorganic pollutants.

AB Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 are contributing to the global
   greenhouse effect. Large scale use of atmospheric CO2 may be a
   sustainable and renewable means of chemical and liquid fuel production
   to mitigate global climate change. Photosynthetic organisms are an ideal
   platform for efficient, natural CO2 conversion to a broad range of
   chemicals. Cyanobacteria are especially attractive for these purposes,
   due to their genetic malleability and relatively fast growth rate.
   Recent years have yielded a range of work in the metabolic engineering
   of cyanobacteria and have led to greater knowledge of the host
   metabolism. Understanding of endogenous and heterologous carbon
   regulation mechanisms leads to the expansion of productive capacity and

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate the industrial waste cane molasses
   as a carbon source for cell growth, lipid and astaxanthin production of
   Chlorella zofingiensis. Pretreated with cation exchange resin to remove
   the metal ions, cane molasses provided better productivities of biomass,
   lipid, and astaxanthin (1.55, 0.71 g L-1 day-1 and 1.7 mg L-1 day-1,
   respectively) than glucose. Using a strategy of semi-continuous cultures
   coupled with feeding at a low concentration, molasses without
   pretreatment has the same effect as pretreated one on supporting the
   algal cell growth, lipid and astaxanthin production. The efficient
   metabolism of molasses triggered the up-regulation of genes involved in
   fatty acid and also astaxanthin biosynthesis, leading to the very high
   production of the two metabolites. This study highlights the possibility
   of using C. zofingiensis to deal with industrial wastes and to produce
   profitable biodiesel as well as the high-value astaxanthin.

AB Despite the known advantages of microalgae compared with other biomass
   providers or fossil fuels, microalgae are predominately produced for
   high-value products. Economic constraints might limit the commercial
   energetic use of microalgae. Therefore, we identify the LCCs (life cycle
   costs) and economic hot spots for photo-autotrophic hydrogen generation
   from photoautotrophically grownChlamydomonas reinhardtiiin a novel
   staggered PBR (photobioreactor) and the anaerobic digestion of the
   residual biomass to obtain biogas. The novel PBR aims at minimizing
   energy consumption for mixing and aeration and at optimizing the light
   conditions for algal growth. The LCCs per MJ amounted to 12.17 Euro for
   hydrogen and 0.99 Euro for biogas in 2011 for Germany. Market prices per
   MJ of 0.02 Euro for biogas and 0.04 Euro for hydrogen are considerably
   exceeded. Major contributors to operating costs, about 70% of total
   LCCs, are personnel and overhead costs. The investment costs consist to
   about 92% of those for the PBR with a share of 61% membrane costs. The
   choice of Madrid as another production location with higher incident
   solar irradiation and lower personnel costs reduces LCCs by about 40%.
   Projecting LCCs to 2030 with experience curves, the LCCs still exceed
   future market prices.

AB Despite being a comparatively new branch of agriculture, algae
   production is often considered to be a solution to many food
   security-related problems, such as land scarcity, climate change,
   inefficient and unsustainable fertilizer usage, as well as associated
   nutrient leakage and water pollution. Algae can be cultivated
   independent of arable land and, especially in the case of many
   microalgae, produce oil- and/or protein-rich biomass with spatial
   efficiency which far exceeds that of terrestrial plants. Nevertheless,
   algae and algae-derived products are almost exclusively produced for
   high-value, low-volume markets and are far from being able to compete
   with cheap commodities such as plant-based proteins or fossil fuel. High
   investment and production costs are considered the main reason for this,
   but a lack of economic incentives for sustainable production and
   CO2mitigation should not be overlooked. The development of new
   production technologies; the monetization of ecosystem services, such as
   water treatment, CO2sequestration, and nutrient recycling; as well as
   the simultaneous production and marketing of "high-value, low-volume"
   and "low-value, high-volume" products from the same algal biomass are
   the most promising ways forward. A sustainable "algae industry" could be
   an integral part of the future bioeconomy, enabling more
   resource-efficient food and fuel production and creating new products,
   companies, and jobs.

AB Algal biomass is an attractive feedstock for sustainable biofuel
   production because of its high growth rate and the fact that it does not
   compete with food crops. This review examines progress made in the
   processing and extraction of microalgal lipids as feedstocks for
   algae-derived biofuels. The discussion focuses on lipid extraction
   processes but also mentions drying, cell disruption, and
   transesterification processes because of their potential effect on the
   extraction process, and because of the possibility of performing them
   simultaneously with extraction. Some of the common themes discussed
   include the benefits of utilizing wet microalgal biomass, combining
   process steps (process intensification), and the importance of
   considering the entire life cycle when assessing the 'greenness' of a
   technology. Lipid extraction technologies will need to be improved for
   microalgal biofuels to compete effectively with fossil fuels,
   particularly through the development of energy-efficient extraction
   methods and the adaptation of these methods for large-scale production.

SO Bioresource Technology
VL 321

U1 8
U2 130
AB Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are platform molecules with numerous
   applications. They can be obtained by adjusting the operational
   conditions of anaerobic digestion to avoid methanogenesis while focusing
   on fermentative stages. There are gaps in the knowledge of how, from a
   life-cycle perspective, the fermentative process performs in VFAs
   production from waste, including environmental consequences of
   substituting common commodities in the current market. Mass and energy
   balances of VFAs production from protein-rich microalgal and
   carbohydrate-rich agro-industrial wastes were used herein as a key
   source of inventory data for life cycle assessment. Two waste treatment
   options were considered: (i) VFAs production (anaerobic fermentation)
   plus anaerobic digestion of the resulting waste after VFAs separation,
   and (ii) anaerobic digestion of the original waste for bioenergy.
   Several scenarios were formulated to evaluate their life-cycle
   performance. VFAs production generally shows a better environmental
   behaviour than conventional anaerobic digestion, principally due to the
   substitution of conventional chemicals.

AB Sustainable socio-economic development largely depends on the
   sustainability of the energy supply from economic, environmental, and
   public health perspectives. Fossil fuel combustion only meets the first
   element of this equation and is hence rendered unsustainable. Biofuels
   are advantageous from a public health perspective, but their
   environmental and economic sustainability might be questioned
   considering the conflicts surrounding their feedstocks, including land
   use change and fuel vs. food conflict. Therefore, it is imperative to
   put more effort into addressing the downsides of biofuel production
   using advanced technologies, such as nanotechnology. In light of that,
   this review strives to scrutinize the latest developments in the
   application of nanotechnology in producing biodiesel, a promising
   alternative to fossil diesel with proven environmental and health
   benefits. The main focus is placed on nanotechnology applications in the
   feedstock production stage. First, the latest findings concerning the
   application of nanomaterials as nanofertilizers and nanopesticides to
   improve the performance of oil crops are presented and critically
   discussed. Then, the most promising results reported recently on
   applying nanotechnology to boost biomass and oil production by
   microalgae and facilitating microalgae harvesting are reviewed and
   mechanistically explained. Finally, the promises held by nanomaterials
   to enhance animal fat production in livestock, poultry, and aquaculture
   systems are elaborated. Despite the favorable features of using
   nanotechnology in biodiesel feedstock production, the presence of
   nanoparticles in living systems is also associated with important health
   and environmental challenges, which are critically covered and discussed
   in this work.

AB Challenges with mid-stream fractionation steps in proposed microalgae
   biofuel pathways arise from the typically dilute cell density in growth
   media, micron scale cell sizes, and often durable cell walls. For
   microalgae to be a sustainable source of biofuels and co-products,
   efficient fractionation by some method will be necessary. This study
   evaluates ultrasonic cell disruption as a processing step that
   fractionates microalgae. A range of species types with different sizes
   and cell wall compositions were treated. The initial seconds of
   sonication offered the most significant disruption, even for the more
   durable Nannochloropsis cells. Following this initial period,
   diminishing effectiveness was attributed, by acoustic measurements, to
   attenuation of the ultrasound in the ensuing cloud of cavitating
   bubbles. At longer exposure times, differences between species were more
   pronounced. Processing higher concentrations of Isochrysis slowed cell
   disintegration only marginally, making the expenditure of energy more
   worthwhile.

AB Due to its abundance and also flexibility of cultivation
   conditions,Chlorella vulgarismicroalgae is one of the most ideal options
   available for microalgae based biodiesel production. Since vulgaris
   cultivation for fuel production needs economic considerations to be
   taken, and in first place, the importance of providing biomass and lipid
   production costs, wide research have been conducted in this field and
   this review study aims to spot the best condition for cultivation of
   this valuable specie by reviewing the whole literature. So far,
   researchers' efforts show that the best condition for vulgaris
   cultivation is mixotrophic regime which is done in a bubble column
   photobioreactor. Glucose as carbonic source and nitrate as nitrogen
   source have the most efficacy among nutrition conditions. The best
   results are obtained when glucose and nitrate content are 20 and 0.5 g/L
   respectively. Alkaline medium (pH 9 to 10), non-continuous illumination,
   5 to 7 Klux and a 200 mL/min aeration flow rate, were known to be the
   best physical conditions. The most vulgaris biomass amount produced was
   3.43 g/L, and the best lipid productivity was measured 66.25 mg/L/day.

AB Wastewater (WW) treatment using microalgae has become a growing trend
   due the economic and environmental benefits of the process. As
   microalgae need CO2, nitrogen, and phosphorus to grow, they remove these
   potential pollutants from wastewaters, making them able to replace
   energetically expensive treatment steps in conventional WW treatment.
   Unlike traditional sludge, biomass can be used to produce biofuels,
   biofertilizers, high value chemicals, and even next-generation growth
   media for "organically" grown microalgal biomass targeting zero-waste
   policies and contributing to a more sustainable circular bioeconomy. The
   main challenge in this technology is the techno-economic feasibility of
   the system. Alternatives such as the isolation of novel strains, the use
   of native consortia, and the design of new bioreactors have been studied
   to overcome this and aid the scale-up of microalgal systems. This review
   focuses on the treatment of urban, industrial, and agricultural
   wastewaters by microalgae and their ability to not only remove, but also
   promote the reuse, of those pollutants. Opportunities and future
   prospects are discussed, including the upgrading of the produced biomass
   into valuable compounds, mainly biofuels.

AB A complex evaluation of antimicrobial activities of microalgae,
   including those relevant to wastewater treatment (WWT), in light of the
   integrated biorefinery concept, is performed. An example of this concept
   is linking a commercial microalgal system to plants, factories, or farms
   that emit polluted wastewater (WW). The microalgae would not only
   metabolize the pollutants - such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) -
   from the WW, thus fueling their biomass, but they would exert an
   antibacterial effect against the pathogenic bacteria there. The biomass
   then could be harvested and used for biofertilizers, biofuels, and
   bioplastics and might possibly be utilized as animal feed, antimicrobial
   and other pharmaceutical agents. A large amount of the research on the
   antimicrobial activity and WWT potential focuses on the families
   Chlorellaceae and Scenedesmaceae, which are also some of the most
   commercially used strains of microalgae. For that reason, they are the
   species chosen for the current review. Furthermore, the increasing
   antimicrobial resistance necessitates the search for antibiotic
   alternatives, and the antibacterial and antifungal activity of
   Chlorellaceae and Scenedesmaceae is very promising. Microalgae are rich
   in antibacterial compounds like polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),
   polysaccharides, carotenoids, proteins, etc., and for that reason, their
   extracts possess antimicrobial effects. The in vitro antimicrobial
   activity of Chlorellaceae and Scenedesmaceae families has varied in a
   broad range from low to strong activity or no effect. Several strains
   have fulfilled the criteria for outstanding and high activity,
   especially C. vulgaris and other Chlorellaceae spp., with an effect
   equal to or better than the control antibiotics. There were several
   strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) below 80 g/mL and
   even 10 and 1.5 g/mL; some species also had inhibition zones (IZ) over
   30 mm, even as high as 48 mm. In vivo results are also promising but
   scarce, and all this warrants further in vivo and in situ studies - from
   animal models to clinical and environmental trials. Altogether,
   important data in the light of the circle economy, the urgent necessity
   to decrease CO2 emissions to fight climate change, and to curb the
   harmful influence of future pandemics are presented. This review paves
   the way for further utilizing the total potential of a microalgal
   system.

AB Microalgal production technologies are seen as increasingly attractive
   for bioenergy production to improve fuel security and reduce
   CO2emissions. Photosynthetically derived fuels are a renewable,
   potentially carbon-neutral and scalable alternative reserve. Microalgae
   have particular promise because they can be produced on non-arable land
   and utilize saline and wastewater streams. Furthermore, emerging
   microalgal technologies can be used to produce a range of products such
   as biofuels, protein-rich animal feeds, chemical feedstocks (e.g.
   bioplastic precursors) and higher-value products. This review focuses on
   the selection, breeding and engineering of microalgae for improved
   biomass and biofuel conversion efficiencies.

AB Microalgal biomass has garnered attention as a renewable and sustainable
   resource for producing biodiesel. The harvesting of microalgal biomass
   is a significant bottleneck being faced by the industries as it is the
   crucial cost driver in the downstream processing of biomass.
   Bioharvesting of microalgal biomass mediated by: microbial, animal, and
   plant-based polymeric flocculants has gained a higher probability of
   utility in accumulation due to: its higher dewatering potential, less
   toxicity, and ecofriendly properties. The present review summarizes the
   key challenges and the technological advancements associated with
   various such harvesting techniques. The economic and technical aspects
   of different microalgal harvesting techniques, particularly the cationic
   polymeric flocculant-based harvesting of microalgal biomass, are also
   discussed. Furthermore, interactions of flocculants with microalgal
   biomass and the effects of these interactions on metabolite and lipid
   extractions are discussed to offer a promising solution for suitability
   in selecting the most efficient and economical method of microalgal
   biomass harvesting for cost-effective biodiesel production.

AB Microalgae have many advantages for the production of biogas by
   anaerobic digestion process. However, the anaerobic digestion process
   has been reported to be limited in the hydrolytic stage due to the
   specific characteristics of the cell wall components thus resulting in
   an inefficient conversion of biomass to biogas. Pre-treatments aim to
   achieve an increase in the biogas production by increasing
   solubilization. Enzymatic pretreatment is described as an
   environmentally-friendly process, due to the low energy consumption,
   great yield of freed, fermentable sugars from the biomass under light
   operational conditions, the absence of corrosive problems, and few
   derivatives produced. Within the category of enzymatic pretreatments, it
   might identify two types, which are related to the origin of the enzymes
   and which may be classified as endogenous enzymes, and commercial
   exogenous enzymes. It should also be considered that enzyme production
   costs for commercial enzymes might be a negative factor in the process.
   The objective of the present review is to analyze and discuss the
   application of digestive pretreatments on the solubilization of
   microalgae, with a focus on the cell wall, and its relation to biogas
   production increase.

AB With the increasing demand for energy, microalgae, as one of the
   promising feedstocks of biodiesel, has raised great awareness. Because
   of its small size, similar density to water and electrical stability,
   harvesting methods of microalgae that have low energy consumption and
   that are highly efficient, easy to large-scale and environmentally
   friendly have become a bottleneck restricting development of the whole
   process. Among the numerous possible harvesting methods, magnetic
   flocculation has the advantages of simple operation, fast separation and
   energy saving and thus is considered as a promising novel harvesting
   method. In this review, we have summarized the updated status and
   application potential of magnetic flocculation, including the principle
   of magnetic flocculation, magnetic flocculating materials, flocculating
   efficiency and its effect on downstream process. The major challenges
   such as magnetic materials recovery, large-scale magnetic flocculation
   device design, and magnetic flocculation costs are also discussed.

AB TheNannochloropsisgenus contains oleaginous microalgae that have served
   as model systems for developing renewable biodiesel. Recent genomic and
   transcriptomic studies onNannochloropsisspecies have provided insights
   into the regulation of lipid production in response to nitrogen stress.
   Previous studies have focused on the responses ofNannochloropsisspecies
   to short-term nitrogen stress, but the effect of long-term nitrogen
   deprivation remains largely unknown. In this study, physiological and
   proteomic approaches were combined to understand the mechanisms by
   whichNannochloropsis oceanicaIMET1 is able to endure long-term nitrate
   deprivation and its ability to recover homeostasis when nitrogen is
   amended. Changes of the proteome during chronic nitrogen starvation
   espoused the physiological changes observed, and there was a general
   trend toward recycling nitrogen and storage of lipids. This was
   evidenced by a global down-regulation of protein expression, a retained
   expression of proteins involved in glycolysis and the synthesis of fatty
   acids, as well as an up-regulation of enzymes used in nitrogen
   scavenging and protein turnover. Also, lipid accumulation and autophagy
   of plastids may play a key role in maintaining cell vitality. Following
   the addition of nitrogen, there were proteomic changes and metabolic
   changes observed within 24 h, which resulted in a return of the culture
   to steady state within 4 d. These results demonstrate the ability ofN.
   oceanicaIMET1 to recover from long periods of nitrate deprivation
   without apparent detriment to the culture and provide proteomic markers
   for genetic modification.

TI Life-cycle assessment of microalgae liquid biofuel production in biofilm
   cultivation system via conversion technologies of transesterification,
   hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis.

AB Biofilm seems to be an ideal cultivation system for microalgae liquid
   biofuel conversion technologies due to the advantage of high biomass
   concentration. However, research on the biofilm cultivation system for
   microalgae liquid biofuel producing were limited. In this study, a
   life-cycle assessment was conducted for microalgae liquid biofuel
   production in this system via three conversion technologies:
   transesterification, hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis. The result
   shows that scenario hydrothermal liquefaction seems to be the most
   feasible technology to produce liquid biofuel in biofilm system because
   only hydrothermal liquefaction achieved positive energy and environment
   benefits with a net energy ratio of 0.87 and Greenhouse gas emissions of
   -39.91 g CO2-eq MJ-1. For transesterification and pyrolysis, the net
   energy ratio (2.18 and 2.06) were larger than 1, while Greenhouse gas
   emissions (3.28 and 59.25 g CO2-eq) were greater than 0. This indicated
   that these scenarios exhibited negative energy and environment benefits
   due to heavy use of chemicals and high energy consumption during biomass
   drying process, respectively. Additionally, according to the sensitivity
   analysis, bio-crude mass yield exhibited a more significant impact on
   the energy and environment loads for scenario hydrothermal liquefaction
   than the other factors.

AB Among the various types of biomass, microalgae have the potential of
   becoming a significant energy source for biofuel production in the
   coming years. Currently, research is mainly focusing on optimization of
   the cultivation methods and the conversion of just a single microalgae
   fraction (lipids for biodiesel production). Hydrothermal liquefaction is
   a method for thermochemical conversion of wet microalgae, producing a
   liquid energy carrier called 'bio-oil' or 'biocrude', next to gaseous,
   aqueous and solid by-products. A review of the available literature is
   presented here, analyzing the influence of parameters such as
   temperature, holding time and catalyst dosage on the yield and
   properties of the different product fractions. Also, the strain
   selection and the status of the technology for hydrothermal processes
   are analyzed. Finally, based on the findings obtained from the
   literature review, directions for future research are suggested.

TI Two-stage cultivation strategy for simultaneous increases in growth rate
   and lipid content of microalgae: a review.
SO Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
VL 119
PY 2020
U1 11
U2 130
AB The depletion of fossil fuels and the search for novel sustainable
   energy sources are challenges faced by countries throughout the world
   over the past few decades. Microalgae have received considerable
   interest as new oil sources for biofuel production. However, the
   enhancement of the lipid content in microalgae strains without
   decreasing the growth rate is a prerequisite for improving the economic
   viability of microalgae-derived biofuel production. The implementation
   of an appropriate cultivation strategy can increase both lipid
   accumulation and biomass production. One of the most-often suggested
   strategies is the cultivation of microalgae through two-stage
   cultivation strategy (TSCS). This paper aims to recapitulate the
   findings of recent studies and achievements in improving the lipid
   productivity and economic feasibility of TSCS. This article starts by
   highlighting different types of TSCS based on various stimuli.
   Afterwards, the most noteworthy culture parameters, including growth
   stage and initial cell density, are addressed. The existing experimental
   results show that lipid productivity can be enhanced by optimizing
   stress factor(s) and engineering processes. Moreover, it is reported
   that the modification or elimination of the pre-harvesting phase (which
   can be done by upgrading technical aspects and/or via stress induction
   strategies) can promote the economic feasibility of TSCSs.

AB In light of the escalating global energy crisis, microalgae have emerged
   as highly promising producers of biofuel and high-value products. Among
   these microalgae,Nannochloropsishas received significant attention due
   to its capacity to generate not only triacylglycerol (TAG) but also
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and valuable carotenoids. Recent
   advancements in genetic tools and the field of synthetic biology have
   revolutionizedNannochloropsisinto a powerful biofactory. This
   comprehensive review provides an initial overview of the current state
   of cultivation and utilization of theNannochloropsisgenus. Subsequently,
   our review examines the metabolic pathways governing lipids and
   carotenoids, emphasizing strategies to enhance oil production and
   optimize carbon flux redirection toward target products. Additionally,
   we summarize the utilization of advanced genetic manipulation techniques
   inNannochloropsis. Together, the insights presented in this review
   highlight the immense potential ofNannochloropsisas a valuable model for
   biofuels and synthetic biology. By effectively integrating genetic tools
   and metabolic engineering, the realization of this potential becomes
   increasingly feasible.

AB Microalgae are aquatic photosynthetic prokaryotic or eukaryotic
   microorganisms which cultivation for the fixation of CO2 and the
   production of biofuels has received large attention. However, the
   sustainable development of an algal biorefinery is still a challenge. In
   this context, the valorization of microalgae biomass for a wastewater
   adsorptive treatment may be an option to explore. Recently, the presence
   of emerging contaminants (ECs) in natural waters and the associated
   risks have led to a great concern, especially in the case of
   pharmaceuticals. In the present work, the elimination of paracetamol
   from water by biosorption onto microalgae, namely Synechocystis sp., has
   been studied. Kinetic and equilibrium parameters have been determined
   and compared with those obtained when using a commercial activated
   carbon under the same experimental conditions. Although the adsorption
   kinetics are very similar onto both materials, at the equilibrium, the
   Langmuir maximum capacity of the activated carbon (278 mg g-1) is five
   times higher than that of Synechocystis sp. (53 mg g-1). In any case, it
   must be considered that the utilization of microalgae may be considered
   an environmentally friendly process with important associated savings.

AB Micropollutants have become a serious environmental problem with several
   negative outcomes for human health and ecosystems. Many efforts have
   been made to remove micropollutants using a variety of physical,
   chemical and biological methods. By far, the most attention has been
   paid to microalgae-based technologies for wastewater treatment in order
   to obtain high-quality effluents, recover algal biomass for fertilizers,
   protein-rich feed, biofuel, and put them to other practical use. This
   paper reviews the potential of microalgae-based systems for the removal
   of organic micropollutants from open ponds to closed photobioreactors
   coupled by suspended microalgal cells, immobilized cells, or
   microalgae-microbial consortia. The inhibition of micropollutants on
   microalgae growth as well as micropollutant removal mechanisms performed
   by microalgae-based systems are also discussed. Other treatment methods
   for the removal of micropollutants are analyzed to show the advantages
   and limitations of microalgae-based treatment strategies, from which
   some possible combined systems can be suggested. Finally, some
   recommendations for future studies on this topic are proposed.

AB Cyanobacteria are represented by a diverse group of microorganisms that,
   by virtue of being a part of marine and freshwater phytoplankton,
   significantly contribute to the fixation of atmospheric carbon via
   photosynthesis. It is assumed that ancient cyanobacteria participated in
   the formation of earth's oil deposits. Biomass of modern cyanobacteria
   may be converted into bio-oil by pyrolysis. Modern cyanobacteria grow
   fast; they do not compete for agricultural lands and resources; they
   efficiently convert excessive amounts of CO2into biomass, thus
   participating in both carbon fixation and organic chemical production.
   Many cyanobacterial species are easier to genetically manipulate than
   eukaryotic algae and other photosynthetic organisms. Thus, the
   cyanobacterial photosynthesis may be directed to produce carbohydrates,
   fatty acids, or alcohols as renewable sources of biofuels. Here we
   review the recent achievements in the developments and production of
   cyanofuels - biofuels produced from cyanobacterial biomass.

AB Oleaginous microalgae and yeast are the two major propitious factories
   which are sustainable sources for biodiesel production, as they can
   accumulate high quantities of lipids inside their bodies. To date,
   various microalgal and yeast species have been exploited singly for
   biodiesel production. However, despite the ongoing efforts, their low
   lipid productivity and the high cost of cultivation are still the major
   bottlenecks hindering their large-scale deployment. Co-culturing of
   microalgae and yeast has the potential to increase the overall lipid
   productivity by minimizing its production cost as both these organisms
   can utilize each other's by-products. Microalgae act as an O2 generator
   for yeast while consuming the CO2 and organic acids released by the
   yeast cells. Further, yeast can break complex sugars in the medium,
   which can then be utilized by microalgae thereby opening new options for
   copious and low-cost feedstocks such as agricultural residues. The
   current review provides a historical and technical overview of the
   existing studies on co-culturing of yeast and microalgae and elucidates
   the crucial factors that affect the symbiotic relationship between these
   two organisms. Furthermore, the review also highlighted the advantages
   and the future perspectives for paving a path towards a sustainable
   biodiesel product.

AB Microalgae are reported as potential source to produce lipids from their
   biomass cells. Lipid as a group of organic compound is a primary raw
   material used in biofuel production as well as component for foods,
   cosmetic products, fertilizers and animal feed. As the resources of
   manufacturing lipid from synthetic media are costly, the derivation of
   inexpensive carbon and nutritional sources from wastewater such as palm
   oil mill effluent (POME) is useful in massive scale. Furthermore, unique
   characteristic of microalgae as alternative agents to treat POME
   wastewater is another encouraging aspect of its application. In
   addition, biodiesel production from algae can produce 5,000-15,000
   gallons of biodiesel per acre/year. However, high yield production of
   high-lipid-content-algae biomass, determination of effective techniques
   in order to harvest grown algae, algal oil extraction and
   trans-esterification of extracted oil for converting into biodiesel are
   challenging issues need deep investigation. This review is focused on
   previous studies on POME as possible carbon and nutritional source used
   to treat environmental pollution caused by POME discharges and to
   increase the growth rate of microalgae in order to high-lipid content
   production.

AB Microalgae can provide solutions to the twin challenges of energy
   security and environmental pollution. They can capture carbon dioxide in
   the flue gas thereby reducing greenhouse gas and also producing algal
   biomass, which can be converted into biofuel. The present study
   evaluated the effects on growth and lipid content ofNannochloropsissp.,
   under reduced nitrogen content and enrichment with sodium
   carbonate/bicarbonate derived from flue gas. Studies have been conducted
   to identify and develop efficient lipid induction techniques in
   microalgae, such as nutrients stress (e.g., nitrogen and/or phosphorus
   starvation), osmotic stress, radiation, pH, temperature, heavy metals
   and other chemicals. Our results showed that the total lipid
   productivity ofNannochloropsissp. cultures aerated with five different
   CO2levels (1, 10, 15, 20 and 25% CO2) had the highest lipid level of
   18.93 mg L-1day-1for the 15% CO2. The growth using soluble carbonates
   was slightly better than when using only CO2gas as carbon source. The
   20% flue gas solution gave maximum yield of dry biomass of 0.55 g, while
   the maximum yield of dry biomass for 15% dissolved CO2gas was around
   0.44 g. In terms of nitrogen level; the concentration of nitrogen at
   0.882 mM gave the best growth and biomass amount. Those with lower
   nitrogen had their growth and biomass reduced by almost 5 times. Lipid
   productivity increased when exposing the culture to nitrogen starvation
   condition. The 100% N cultures (0.882 mM) yielded the lowest lipid
   productivity, while the 25% N cultures (0.353 mM) showed the highest
   productivity of lipid. The cells that grew in the lowest nitrogen
   content showed slightly more than twice the productivity of oil
   production compared with the one with 100% N cultures. This work has
   described the favorable conditions for lipid production
   byNannochloropsissp. in respect to CO2gas, soluble carbonates and
   different nitrogen concentrations.

   methane production.
SO Fermentation
VL 8

U1 13
U2 52
AB Anaerobic digestion of microalgae and cyanobacteria was first proposed
   as a destination for algal biomass accumulated on stabilization ponds
   since it could not be disposed of directly in the environment. Now, the
   versatility of algal biomass makes them a suitable candidate to produce
   biofuels and other biomolecules in biorefineries. Anaerobic digestion of
   biomass is advantageous because it does not require the extraction of
   specific cellular constituents or drying of the biomass. Nevertheless,
   challenges remain regarding biomass concentration and their resistant
   cell walls, which are factors that could hamper methane yield. Many
   pretreatment methods, including chemical and thermochemical, have been
   proposed to break down the complex polymers present on the cell wall
   into smaller molecules. Unfortunately, the relationship between biomass
   solubilization and methane yield is not well defined. This article
   intends to review the anaerobic digestion of algal biomass and the role
   of chemical and thermochemical pretreatments in enhancing methane
   production. Several pretreatment conditions selected from the scientific
   literature were compared to verify which conditions actually improve
   methane yield. The severity of the selected pretreatments was also
   assessed using the combined severity factor. Results suggest that
   thermochemical pretreatment in less severe conditions is the most
   efficient, leading to a greater increase in methane yield. Only
   enzymatic pretreatments and some thermal pretreatments result in a
   positive energy balance. The large-scale implementation of pretreatment
   methods requires technological innovations to reduce energy consumption
   and its integration with other processes in wastewater treatment plants.

AB Oleaginous microalgae biomass has gained noteworthy attention as
   feedstock for biofuel production due to its fast growth rate and
   capability of growing in non-arable land with high lipid content. Among
   biofuels, biodiesel has been a prevailing area of interest to many
   researchers. Prior to transformation of microalgae lipid into biodiesel,
   a lipid extraction step needs to be performed to disrupt the microalgal
   cell walls in order to extract the lipid. Hence, selecting an
   appropriate extraction solvent is of the utmost importance to ensure the
   efficient extraction of desired lipid content which can then be
   transformed into high quality biodiesel. Conventional organic solvents
   such as chloroform, dichloromethane and methanol are usually used in
   lipid extraction due to its high extraction efficiency. However,
   toxicity and environmental issues related to these solvents are of major
   concerns. Hence, many recent studies have focused on the use of green
   solvents such as bio-based solvents, supercritical carbon dioxide and
   ionic liquids. This review discusses the use of conventional organic
   solvents and green solvents in microalgae lipid extraction. Advantages
   and shortcomings of these solvents are also discussed. In addition, the
   future perspective for extraction solvents used in lipid extraction is
   also discussed.

AB Microalgae are emerging as a promising source for augmenting the supply

   industry, the high energy consumption for harvesting remains a
   significant obstacle. This review offers a comprehensive overview of

   with particular emphasis on the latest advances in flocculation
   techniques. These cutting-edge methods have been applied to biodiesel
   production, food and nutraceutical processing, and wastewater treatment.
   Large-scale harvesting is still severely impeded by the high cost
   despite progress has been made in laboratory studies. In the future,
   cost-effective microalgal harvesting will rely on efficient resource
   utilization, including the use of waste materials and the reuse of media
   and flocculants. Additionally, precise regulation of biological
   metabolism will be necessary to overcome algal species-related
   limitations through the development of extracellular polymeric
   substance-induced flocculation technology.

   effective harvesting of the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris via
   flocculation-flotation. A flotation efficiency of 92.7% was observed
   when 20 mg L-1 bioflocculant was tested for flocculating the microalgal
   cells with 5 mM CaCl2. The bioflocculant was stable at wide ranges of pH
   and temperature, which is advantageous for its application under various
   conditions. Chemical analysis of the bioflocculant indicated that it is
   composed of 31.6% total sugar and 0.2% protein (w/w). This bioflocculant
   has potential for the high-efficiency harvesting of microalgae and may
   be useful in reducing one of the barriers to microalgal biofuel
   production.

AB This chapter discusses the use of blue-green algae, cyanobacteria, for
   biofuel production and summarizes the relevant aspects of cyanobacterial
   biology to review the products that are obtained from cyanobacteria. It
   also discusses the use of genetic modification techniques to engineer
   cyanobacteria, and reviews examples where companies have begun
   commercial growth of genetically-modified cyanobacteria for biofuels.
   Unlike plants, many cyanobacteria are capable of fixing nitrogen (N 2)
   to ammonia (NH3), a form which can be used for cellular processes.
   Cyanobacteria, notably Arthrospira species, have been exploited as a
   food source for over a millennium in the region of Lake Chad, Africa.
   Under ideal conditions, cyanobacteria grow extremely fast compared to
   other photosynthetic microbes or plants. The cyanobacteria possess
   numerous desirable properties for industrial deployment, including the
   direct fixation of CO 2, extremely fast growth rates, the possibility
   for culture in extreme environments that reduce or preclude
   contamination risks and the possibility of targeted and subtle genetic
   engineering.

AB There has been an increasing interest in cyanobacteria because these
   photosynthetic organisms convert solar energy into biomass and because
   of their potential for the production of biofuels. However, the
   exploitation of cyanobacteria for bioengineering requires knowledge of
   their transcriptional organization. Using differential RNA sequencing,
   we have established a genome-wide map of 3,527 transcriptional start
   sites (TSS) of the model organism Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. One-third
   of all TSS were located upstream of an annotated gene; another third
   were on the reverse complementary strand of 866 genes, suggesting
   massive antisense transcription. Orphan TSS located in intergenic
   regions led us to predict 314 noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Complementary
   microarray-based RNA profiling verified a high number of noncoding
   transcripts and identified strong ncRNA regulations. Thus, 64% of all
   TSS give rise to antisense or ncRNAs in a genome that is to 87% protein
   coding. Our data enhance the information on promoters by a factor of 40,
   suggest the existence of additional small peptide-encoding mRNAs, and
   provide corrected 5′ annotations for many genes of this cyanobacterium.
   The global TSS map will facilitate the use of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803
   as a model organism for further research on photosynthesis and energy
   research.

AB Coupling municipal anaerobic digestate (MAD) treatments with microalgal
   cultivation can concomitantly achieve nutrient removal and microalgal
   bioenergy production. However, the high cost caused by dilution water
   and microalgal harvesting is a great challenge. In this study,
   Scenedesmus quadricauda was screened as the most appropriate algae
   strain due to its potential for growth and auto-flocculation, and the
   MAD diluted 5-fold with WWTP effluent was demonstrated as an ideal
   medium for S. quadricauda growth. Moreover, inspired by naturally
   generated silica shells of diatoms, a low-cost and biomimetic
   auto-flocculation strategy that combined high light intensity induction
   and microalgal silicification was proposed to accelerate the
   auto-flocculation process. Compared with low light intensity groups,
   this strategy imparted diatom-like features to S. quadricauda cells, and
   contributed to 3.07-fold higher auto-flocculation efficiency within 30
   min. It was attributed to the fact that the high light intensity of 150
   mumol.m-2.s-1 stimulated the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
   secretion and induced the variation in property and composition of EPS,
   especially the protein secondary structures, which allowed silica
   nanoparticles to spontaneously attach onto S. quadricauda cells in the
   presence of viscous EPS. Furthermore, this strategy significantly
   increased microalgal biomass yield to a dry weight of 1.37 g.L-1,
   accompanied by 93.78%, 96.39% and 91.36% removals of NH4+-N, TP, and
   COD, respectively. The productivity of valuable by-products, including
   lipid, carbohydrate, protein, and pigment, reached 56.30, 101.35, 30.39
   and 11.28 mg.L-1.d-1, respectively. Overall, this study supplies a novel
   approach for low-cost microalgal bioenergy production from MAD and
   energy-efficient microalgae harvest by auto-flocculation.

AB In the current global context, industrial processes follow a classical
   model wherein pollution is accepted as a negative environmental
   externality that is compensated by a positive economic externality.
   Positive effects range from the exploitation of mineral resources and
   their local and regional advantages to the use of energy in industry.
   The Blue Economy incorporates the concept of rethinking industrial
   processes and seeking a viable biological solution that reduces
   pollution. Microalgae have been extensively studied due to the potential
   of using industrial effluents as a source of nutrients, such as the CO2
   emitted from thermoelectric plants. The biomass produced by these
   microorganisms can be fully utilized in a microalgae-based
   photobiorefinery, which operates under the principle of producing
   biofuels and high-value co-products while aiming to improve economic
   viability. This review aims to present the concepts of a microalgae
   biorefinery from the use of greenhouse gases by applying the
   fundamentals of the Blue Economy to collaborate to reduce CO2 emissions
   from thermoelectric plants.

AB High density cultivation is essential to industrial production of
   biodiesel from microalgae, which involves in variations of
   micro-environment around individual cells, including light intensity,
   nutrition distribution, other abiotic stress and so on. To figure out
   the main limit factor in high inoculum cultivation, a quantitative
   proteomic analysis (iTRAQ-on-line 2-D nano-LC/MS) in a non-model green
   microalga,Chlorella sorokiniana, under different inoculum sizes was
   conducted. The resulting high-quality proteomic dataset consisted of 695
   proteins. Using a cutoff ofP<0.05, 241 unique proteins with differential
   expression levels were identified between control and different inoculum
   sizes. Functional analysis showed that proteins participating in
   photosynthesis (light reaction) and Calvin cycle (carbon reaction
   pathway) had highest expression levels under inoculum size of 1*106cells
   mL-1, and lowest levels under 1*107cells mL-1. Canonical correlation
   analysis of the photosynthesis related proteins and metabolites
   biomarkers showed that a good correlation existed between them
   (canonical coefficient was 0.987), suggesting photosynthesis process
   greatly affected microalgae biodiesel productivity and quality.
   Proteomic study ofC. sorokinianaunder different illuminations was also
   conducted to confirm light intensity as a potential limit factor of high
   inoculum size. Nearly two thirds of proteins showed up-regulation under
   the illumination of 70-110 mol m-2s-1, compared to those of 40 mol
   m-2s-1. This result suggested that by elegantly adjusting light
   conditions, high cell density cultivation and high biodiesel production
   might be achieved.

AB Due to their rapid growth rates, high lipid productivity, and ability to
   synthesize value-added products, microalgae are considered as the
   potential biofuel feedstocks. However, among the several bottlenecks
   that are hindering the commercialization of microalgal biofuel
   synthesis, the issue of high water consumption is the least explored.
   This analysis, therefore, examines the factors that decide water use for
   the production of microalgae biofuel. Microalgae biodiesel water
   footprint varies from 3.5 to 3726 kg of water per kg of biodiesel. The
   study further investigates the cause for large variability in the
   estimation of the water footprint for microalgae fuel. Various
   strategies, including the reuse of harvested water, the use of high
   density cultivation that could be adopted for low water consumption in
   microalgal biofuel production are discussed. Specifically, the review
   identified a reciprocal relationship between biomass productivity and
   water footprint. On the basis of which the review emphasizes the
   significance of high density cultivation, which can be inexpensive and
   feasible relative to other water-saving techniques. With the setback of
   water scarcity due to the rapid industrialization in developing
   countries, the implementation of the cultivation system with a focus on
   minimizing the water consumption is inevitable for a successful large
   scale microalgal biofuel production.

AB Development of sustainable energy is a pivotal step towards solutions
   for today's global challenges, including mitigating the progression of
   climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Biofuels derived
   from agricultural crops have already been commercialized. However the
   impacts on environmental sustainability and food supply have raised
   ethical questions about the current practices. Cyanobacteria have
   attracted interest as an alternative means for sustainable energy
   productions. Being aquatic photoautotrophs they can be cultivated in
   non-arable lands and do not compete for land for food production. Their
   rich genetic resources offer means to engineer metabolic pathways for
   synthesis of valuable bio-based products. Currently the major obstacle
   in industrial-scale exploitation of cyanobacteria as the economically
   sustainable production hosts is low yields. Much effort has been made to
   improve the carbon fixation and manipulating the carbon allocation in
   cyanobacteria and their evolutionary photosynthetic relatives, algae and
   plants. This review aims at providing an overview of the recent progress
   in the bioengineering of carbon fixation and allocation in
   cyanobacteria; wherever relevant, the progress made in plants and algae
   is also discussed as an inspiration for future application in
   cyanobacteria.

   and biomass production by co-culture ofChlorella vulgarisand activated
   sludge in a batch photobioreactor (PBR), compared with their single
   system to treat a low C/N ratio (COD/N=4.3) wastewater. The co-culture
   system surpassed activated sludge system in terms of nutrients removal
   and outperformed microalgae alone system in regard to COD removal.
   Biomass productivity of the co-culture system was 343.3 mg L-1d-1, and
   the harvested biomass could be developed as biofuels, animal feeds or
   soil conditioners due to the improved calorific value and cellular
   composition compared with activated sludge. The low C/N ratio wastewater
   enabled bacteria to maintain a relatively low level, hence in favor of
   microalgae enrichment and nutrient recovery.

   engineering could provide substantial advancements in producing novel
   and promising strains for the production of alternative biofuels. In
   this review, we have highlighted biotechnological strategies for
   microalgae and cyanobacteria that target the improvement of: (1)
   biosynthesis of biofuel precursors (fatty acid, TAGs, and lipids etc.),
   (2) carbon-capture ability to accumulate more lipids, and (3)
   engineering hydrogenases for augmented production of biohydrogen. Other
   strategies for improving quality and quantity of algal biofuels are also
   explored.

AB The growing concern for the increase of the global warming effects due
   to anthropogenic activities raises the challenge of finding novel
   technological approaches to stabilize CO2 emissions in the atmosphere
   and counteract impinging interconnected issues such as desertification
   and loss of biodiversity. Biological-CO2 mitigation, triggered through
   biological fixation, is considered a promising and eco-sustainable
   method, mostly owing to its downstream benefits that can be exploited.
   Microorganisms such as cyanobacteria, green algae and some autotrophic
   bacteria could potentially fix CO2 more efficiently than higher plants,
   due to their faster growth. Some examples of the potential of
   biological-CO2 mitigation are reported and discussed in this paper. In
   arid and semiarid environments, soil carbon sequestration (CO2 fixation)
   by cyanobacteria and biological soil crusts is considered an
   eco-friendly and natural process to increase soil C content and a viable
   pathway to soil restoration after one disturbance event. Another way for
   biological-CO2 mitigation intensively studied in the last few years is
   related to the possibility to perform carbon dioxide sequestration using
   microalgae, obtaining at the same time bioproducts of industrial
   interest. Another possibility under study is the exploitation of
   specific chemotrophic bacteria, such as Ralstonia eutropha (or picketii)
   and related organisms, for CO2 fixation coupled with the production
   chemicals such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). In spite of the
   potential of these processes, multiple factors still have to be
   optimized for maximum rate of CO2 fixation by these microorganisms. The
   optimization of culture conditions, including the optimal concentration
   of CO2 in the provided gas, the use of metabolic engineering and of dual
   purpose systems for the treatment of wastewater and production of
   biofuels and high value products within a biorefinery concept, the
   design of photobioreactors in the case of phototrophs are some of the
   issues that, among others, have to be addressed and tested for
   cost-effective CO2 sequestration.

AB A study was conducted to develop a MEMS-based biofuel-solar hybrid cell
   utilizing novel fabrication processes and structures with acquisition
   cost, weight and volume comparable to other market options for future
   remote autonomous mobile or portable systems and its electrochemical
   characterization. The working principle of a micro Photosynthetic
   Electrochemical Cell is comprised of an anode chamber on the left side,
   a cathode on the right and an ionsensitive membrane (a proton exchange
   membrane) in between to separate the anode and cathode chambers. The
   anolyte consisted of either the Anabaena variabilis in a pure water
   medium with or without polyaniline, or Chlorella vulgaris in a pure
   water medium with 0.01 M methylene blue; on the cathode side, a
   catholyte consisted of either 0.02 M potassium ferricyanide in a 0.1 M
   sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) or pure water and polyaniline. Novel
   nanostructure and modified polyaniline were used to enhance the
   performance of the biofuel cell. Results indicated that the spin-cast
   plus ultrasonic mixing routine proved to be an appropriate method to
   disperse polyaniline. Polyaniline from suitable combinations of Cu and
   carbon cloth electrodes exhibited catalytic particles and noticeable
   catalytic properties for CO and organic substance (glucose) oxidation.
   The new layered structure involving polyaniline and the new method
   improved the oxidation of glucose and reduced the poisoning effect and
   at the same time facilitated the electron transfer process. The novel
   structure of the anode, membrane-electrode assembly, and cathode and the
   new fabrication process ascertains the composition that yields the best
   relationship on the polymeric matrix (polyaniline) to improve the
   oxidation of adsorbed CO and glucose, reduce the poisoning effect and to
   scrutinize its morphology and compare its electrocatalytic activity to
   facilitate the electron transfer process. Polyaniline also serves as a
   barrier to reduce the crossover of the fluids between anode and cathode.

AB The antioxidant and food pigment astaxanthin (AX) can be produced by
   several microorganisms, in auto- or heterotrophic conditions. Regardless
   of the organism, AX concentrations in culture media are low, typically
   about 10-40 mg/L. Therefore, large amounts of nutrients and water are
   necessary to prepare culture media. Using low-cost substrates such as
   agro-industrial solid and liquid wastes is desirable for cost reduction.
   This opens up the opportunity of coupling AX production to other
   existing processes, taking advantage of available residues or
   co-products in a biorefinery approach. Indeed, the scientific literature
   shows that many attempts are being made to produce AX from residues.
   However, this brings challenges regarding raw material variability,
   process conditions, product titers, and downstream processing. This text
   overviews nutritional requirements and suitable culture media for
   producing AX-rich biomass: production and productivity ranges, residue
   pretreatment, and how the selected microorganism and culture media
   combinations affect further biomass production and quality.
   State-of-the-art technology indicates that, while H. pluvialis will
   remain an important source of AX, X. dendrorhous may be used in novel
   processes using residues.

   in hydrocarbonated chains. Depending on the fatty acid profile, the oils
   obtained from oleaginous microorganisms are utilized as feedstock for
   either biodiesel production or as nutraceuticals. Mainly microalgae,
   bacteria, and yeasts are involved in the production of biodiesel,
   whereas thraustochytrids, fungi, and some of the microalgae are well
   known to be producers of very long-chain PUFA (omega-3 fatty acids). In
   this review article, the type of oleaginous microorganisms and their
   expertise in the field of biodiesel or omega-3 fatty acids, advances in
   metabolic engineering tools for enhanced lipid accumulation, upstream
   and downstream processing of lipids, including purification of biodiesel
   and concentration of omega-3 fatty acids are reviewed.

AB Photosynthetic chemical production in cyanobacteria is a promising
   technology for renewable energy, CO2 mitigation, and fossil fuel
   replacement. Metabolic engineering has enabled a direct biosynthetic
   process from CO2 fixation to chemical feedstocks and biofuels, without
   requiring costly production, storage, and breakdown of cellulose or
   sugars. However, direct production technology is challenged by a need to
   achieve high-carbon partitioning to products in order to be competitive.
   This review discusses principles for the design of biosynthetic pathways
   in cyanobacteria and describes recent advances in relevant genetic
   tools. This field is at a critical juncture in assessing the strength
   and feasibility of carbon partitioning. To address this, we have
   included the stoichiometry of reducing equivalents and carbon
   conservation for heterologous pathways, and a method for calculating
   product yields against a theoretical maximum.

AB Based on their environmental benefits, microalgae are currently the most
   favorable renewable biofeedstock materials for biodiesel production.
   However, the possibility of an economically viable production system
   using microalgae is still technology-driven, not yet market-driven due
   to its higher production cost. Accordingly, to establish industrial
   manufacturing systems for microalgal biodiesel, it is critical to
   develop technology for its cost-effective production. Here, we propose
   some novel molecular strategies, which have not been attempted for
   microalgal biodiesel production and are conducive to cost-effective
   production of biodiesel from microalgae. These include genetic
   manipulation strategies for higher biomass yield and extracellular
   production of free fatty acids, triacylglycerol, and fatty acid ethyl
   ester (biodiesel) with high quality, which could be exploited as a
   breakthrough technology for the cost-efficient production of microalgal
   biodiesel.

AB Microalgae feedstock is recognised as one of the most promising
   resources for producing triglycerides which is subsequently converted to
   biodiesel. However, the large-scale technology required to generate
   biodiesel from microalgae is still in its early stages of development.
   Microalgae research to date may be placed into four broad categories:
   (i) growth, (ii) harvesting, (iii) oil extraction and (iv) fuel
   properties for engine performance and emissions. More than 1000
   manuscripts have been published on the first category with progressively
   less on subsequent groups. Finally, effects of microalgae methyl esters
   on engine performance have only been reported in 9 scientific articles.
   This review will place extraction techniques and engine performance of
   microalgae biodiesel in the context of the preceding two categories and
   examine the practical problems associated with fuel properties, engine
   performance and emissions. Considering energy consumption, toxicity, and
   time, many of the extraction techniques used in the laboratory show
   moderate potential for commercial scale. An important finding is that
   variation of conditions in the first three categories can have a
   significant effect on biofuel quality which can cause fuel properties to
   be out of standard and/or adversely affect engine performance and
   emissions.

AB Availability of cost-effective nutrients for the commercial cultivation
   of microalgae is one of the major challenges. The present study
   investigated the feasibility of primary municipal wastewater (PMWW)
   collected from a local wastewater treatment plant in Minnesota, USA as
   an alternative to fresh-water microalgae growth media towards high-value
   bioenergy feedstock production. The novel strainScenedesmussp. DDVG I
   was cultivated in the PMWW under heterotrophic and mixotrophic modes in
   250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. The optimized cultivation mode was further
   scaled up to the 3-L bubbled bioreactor. The study confirmed the
   wastewater as a potential growth medium whileScenedesmussp. DDVG I
   showed superior biomass productivity (0.069 g/L d), lipid yield (22.5%),
   and FAME content (22.04% in dry cell weight) over 10 days in the
   mixotrophic mode. The biomass also showed high essential amino acid
   content (159.8 mg/g DCW). The corresponding values for bioremediation
   efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN)
   byScenedesmussp. were 75.6% and 99.8% respectively. Meanwhile, ammonia
   nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) were removed at up to 100%
   removal efficiencies. Analyses of fatty acid profile and different
   parameters that were required for biodiesel characterization revealed
   the high-quality nature of theScenedesmus-derived oil. Overall, the
   study concluded effective bioremediation of municipal wastewater
   byScenedesmussp. DDVG I with the recovery of valuable resources from the
   biomass.

AB In order to increase the economic feasibility of biodiesel production
   from microalgae, the residual biomass after biodiesel production can be
   utilized as biosorbent for heavy metal removal. In this study,
   biosorption of chromium by residual Nannochloris oculata after lipid
   extraction was investigated. Increased surface area of N. oculata was
   observed after lipid extraction. Cr(III) removal increased as the pH
   increased from 2 to 6, while Cr(VI) removal was highest at pH 2 and it
   decreased with the increase in pH. Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) in the
   presence of biomass under acidic conditions; X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy revealed that the converted Cr(III) was bound to the
   biomass. Chromium removal was significantly enhanced at high chromium
   concentrations, which indicates that surface reactions may occur at high
   chromium/biomass ratios. FTIR study indicated that phosphate and
   carboxyl functional groups of the biomass were mainly responsible for
   chromium binding.

AB Microalgae biomass contains various useful bio-active components.
   Microalgae derived biodiesel has been researched for almost two decades.
   However, sole biodiesel extraction from microalgae is time-consuming and
   is not economically feasible due to competitive fossil fuel prices.
   Microalgae also contains proteins and carbohydrates in abundance.
   Microalgae are likewise utilized to extract high-value products such as
   pigments, anti-oxidants and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which
   are useful in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry. These
   compounds can be extracted simultaneously or sequentially after
   biodiesel extraction to reduce the total expenditure involved in the
   process. This approach of bio-refinery is necessary to promote
   microalgae in the commercial market. Researchers have been keen on
   utilizing the bio-refinery approach to exploit the valuable components
   encased by microalgae. Apart from all the beneficial components housed
   by microalgae, they also help in reducing the anthropogenic CO2 levels
   of the atmosphere while utilizing saline or wastewater. These benefits
   enable microalgae as a potential source for bio-refinery approach.
   Although life-cycle analysis and economic assessment do not favor the
   use of microalgae biomass feedstock to produce biofuel and co-products
   with the existing techniques, this review still aims to highlight the
   beneficial components of microalgae and their importance to humans. In
   addition, this article also focuses on current and future aspects of
   improving the feasibility of bio-processing for microalgae bio-refinery.

   dimorphus(Turpin) P. Tsarenko, which can become the replacement for the
   commonly used raw materials for anaerobic digestion. Recent scientific
   focus has targeted the research of alternative renewable energy sources.
   Green microalgae are the alternative raw material for generating

AB Palm oil industry is one of the leading agricultural industries in
   Malaysia with average crude palm oil production of more than 13 million
   tonne per year. However, production of such huge amount of crude palm
   oil has consequently resulted to even larger amount of palm oil mill
   effluent (POME). POME is a highly polluting wastewater with high
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in
   which can caused severe pollution to the environment, typically
   pollution to water resources. On the other hand, POME was identified as
   a potential source to generate renewable bioenergies such as biomethane
   and biohydrogen through anaerobic digestion. In other words, a
   combination of wastewater treatment and renewable bioenergies production
   would be an added advantage to the palm oil industry. In line with the
   world's focus on sustainability concept, such strategy should be
   implemented immediately to ensure palm oil is produced in an
   environmental friendly and sustainable manner. This review aims to
   discuss various technologies to convert POME to biomethane and
   biohydrogen in a commercial scale. Furthermore, discussion on using POME
   to culture microalgae for biodiesel and bioethanol production was
   included in the present paper as a new remedy to utilize POME with a
   greater beneficial return.

AB Biodiesel is a renewable and environmentally friendly alternative fuel,
   which is comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids
   derived from renewable resources. However, biodiesel production is
   dependent on available feedstocks and the growth of biodiesel as a
   petroleum diesel substitute is limited by the expensive cost of
   feedstock. Microalgae are among the most promising of nonfood based
   biomass fuel feedstock alternatives. Algal biofuels production is
   challenged by limited oil content, growth rate and economical
   cultivation and extraction techniques. This article summarizes the
   current state of research related to potential algal strains,
   cultivation conditions, biomass production rates and technologies for
   extraction of algal oil and production of biodiesel.

AB The consumption of energy around the globe is increasing continuously,
   which is mostly fulfilled by fossil fuel which is a nonrenewable source
   of energy. To meet the demand and supply, researchers need to identify
   and promote a renewable source of energy. Among various source of
   renewable energy, microalgae would be considered as an emerging and
   reliable feedstock which would be able to replace the fossil fuel-based
   source. Due to its high lipid contents (30% of dry cell mass) and high
   growth rate, microalgae would be able to produce higher amount of
   bioenergy in comparison to various renewable energy sources. Still, the
   key challenges associated with algal biodiesel are recovery of lipids
   from algal biomass and their conversion to fatty acid methyl esters
   (FAME). Therefore, the current chapter enlightens the whole process of
   biodiesel production including selection of feedstock, harvesting of
   algal biomass, extraction and purification of lipids, and finally
   production of biodiesel and value-added products via various routes.

TI A novel one-stage cultivation/fermentation strategy for improved biogas
   production with microalgal biomass.
SO Journal of Biotechnology
VL 215
PS 44-51
PY 2015
U1 2
U2 56
AB The use of alga biomass for biogas generation has been studied for over
   fifty years but until today, several distinct features, like inefficient
   degradation and low C/N ratios, limit the applicability of algal biomass
   for biogas production in larger scale. In this work we investigated a
   novel, one-stage combined cultivation/fermentation strategy including
   inherently progressing nitrogen starvation conditions to generate
   improved microalgal biomass substrates. For this strategy, comparable
   low amounts of nitrogen fertilizers were applied during cultivation and
   no additional enzymatic, chemical or physical pretreatments had to be
   performed. The results of this study demonstrate that progressing
   nitrogen limitation leads to continuously increasing C/N ratios of the
   biomass up to levels of 24-26 for all three tested alga strains
   (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Parachlorella kessleri and Scenedesmus
   obliquus). Importantly, the degradation efficiency of the algal cells
   increased with progressing starvation, leading to strain-specific cell
   disintegration efficiencies of 35%-100% during the fermentation process.
   Nitrogen limitation treatment resulted in a 65% increase of biogas
   yields for C. reinhardtii biomass (max. 69823 mL biogas g-1 VS) when
   compared to replete conditions. For P. kessleri and S. obliquus, yields
   increased by 94% and 106% (max. 70639 mL and 58636 mL biogas g-1 VS,
   respectively). From these results we conclude that this novel one-stage
   cultivation strategy with inherent nitrogen limitation can be used as a
   pretreatment for microalgal biomass generation, in order to produce
   accessible substrates with optimized C/N ratios for the subsequent
   anaerobic fermentation process, thus increasing methane production and
   avoiding the risk of ammonia inhibition effects within the fermenter.

AB In all biorefinery systems, excess water represents a key challenge, and
   its removal by drying is often a necessary and crucial pre-treatment.
   Second-generation feedstocks have often fallen at this hurdle,
   particularly microalgae-derived biomasses, which require extensive (and
   costly) dewatering. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has gained
   increasing attention in recent years as a technology that uses the water
   present in the feedstock as a versatile reaction medium, which functions
   as a solvent, reactant, and catalyst for a cascade of organic reactions.
   Converting organic biomasses into oil, aqueous, solid, and gas
   fractions, the development of HTL provides the opportunity to exploit
   previously unsuitable biomasses in a versatile bio-refinery approach.
   Marine macroalgae (seaweeds) offer a sustainable source of renewable
   biomass, which require no land or freshwater to cultivate or harvest.
   With 70% of the surface of the planet covered in seawater and levels of
   eutrophication increasing, seaweeds are an underutilized resource with
   excellent potential for relieving the pressure on fossil resources.
   Hitherto, this exploitation has been hindered by a lack of suitable and
   economical processing tools. Here we review the potential for applying
   HTL to processing marine macroalgae and discuss the potential products
   and services that can be derived from this potential biorefinery system.

AB Microalgae are viewed as one of the most perspective producers of lipids
   for biodiesel production. The review shows the results of research into
   increasing the expression of genes directly participating in the
   biosynthesis of fatty acids. The increase in the effectiveness of solar
   energy absorption and carbon dioxide fixation influences the microalgae
   productivity. Blocking the expression of genes that are responsible for
   starch synthesis changes the balance towards growth in the quantity of
   lipids in a cell. A change in the length of the carbon backbone chain in
   fatty acids towards its shortening is important in the technology of
   biodiesel production. Manipulation processes of lipid catabolism is
   another way of increasing their quantity. At last, using the methods of
   transcription analysis allows us to understand deeper the process of
   intensive accumulation of lipids under stressful conditions for the
   purpose of directing these processes.

AB Hydrogen is a clean and green biofuel choice for the future because it
   is carbon-free, non-toxic, and has high energy conversion efficiency. In
   exploiting hydrogen as the main energy, guidelines for implementing the
   hydrogen economy and roadmaps for the developments of hydrogen
   technology have been released by several countries. Besides, this review
   also unveils various hydrogen storage methods and applications of
   hydrogen in transportation industry. Biohydrogen productions from
   microbes, namely, fermentative bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria,
   cyanobacteria, and green microalgae, via biological metabolisms have
   received significant interests off late due to its sustainability and
   environmentally friendly potentials. Accordingly, the review is as well
   outlining the biohydrogen production processes by various microbes.
   Furthermore, several factors such as light intensity, pH, temperature
   and addition of supplementary nutrients to enhance the microbial
   biohydrogen production are highlighted at their respective optimum
   conditions. Despite the advantages, the amounts of biohydrogen being
   produced by microbes are still insufficient to be a competitive energy
   source in the market. In addition, several major obstacles have also
   directly hampered the commercialization effors of biohydrogen. Thus,
   this review uncovers the constraints of biohydrogen production from
   microbes such as microalgae and offers solutions associated with recent
   strategies to overcome the setbacks via genetic engineering,
   pretreatments of biomass, and introduction of nanoparticles as well as
   oxygen scavengers. The opportunities of exploiting microalgae as a
   suastainable source of biohydrogen production and the plausibility to
   produce biohydrogen from biowastes are accentuated. Lastly, this review
   addresses the future perspectives of biological methods to ensure the
   sustainability and economy viability of biohydrogen production.

AB The development of new biotechnology methods can solve public concerns
   especially on global warming and environmental pollution. This can be
   achieved by using integrated biorefinery bioprocesses to introduce
   biomass as a very best renewable source, to replace petroleum and to
   develop new bio-based products in an industrial scale. Genetic
   engineering of organisms and improving bioreactors is currently
   substantial approaches to increase biorefinery yields. The use of
   various feedstocks in new-generation biorefinery requires a flexible
   route with the lowest limitations. Biological approaches have attracted
   substantial interest in the conversion of biomass into biomaterial and
   biofuel. As a result of increase in valuable products due to the biomass
   conversion, the interest on biorefinery is higher than that of
   petroleum. Biotechnology is an integral aspect of new biology. Through
   genetic and metabolic engineering, bio-based products can be generated
   from living cells such as microalgae, bacteria and fungi. Greenhouse gas
   emission and CO2 can be released from the biomass feedstocks by chemical
   and thermochemical processes, while it can be reduced by increasing the
   use of biotechnological approach in biorefinery system. In order to
   manage our waste and at the same time produce valuable products,
   biotechnology approaches are very favorable and applicable than
   conventional methods. Collectively, the integration of biological routes
   with conventional routes can decrease operation cost by using waste
   materials, preventing environmental pollution, and, therefore, producing
   valuable by-products.

AB Microalgae are potential sources of high-value lipids, with essential
   fatty acids that provide health benefits, as the omega-3 polyunsaturated
   fatty acids . However, its cultivation and downstream processing is
   still not commercially viable for some applications due to high-water
   consumption and high costs mainly regarding energy demands and nutrients
   as nitrogen. Therefore, using waste streams in existing industries as
   carbon and nutrient sources, as well as evaluating the best
   methodologies for growth and lipid extraction are essential to viabilize
   this process. This review focused on the study of scenario the of using
   different microalgae species, integrating their cultivation into
   biorefineries using their wastewater and carbon dioxide combating water
   and air pollution, aiming lipid productivity and fatty acid profile with
   specific composition. It was found that culture medium conditions and
   cultivation systems are key elements in understanding the lipid
   production and can decisively affect the process performance. For
   example, closed photobioreactors with CO2 supply and light can provide
   higher photosynthetic efficiency and lipid accumulation, coupled with
   polyunsaturated fatty acid production. Wastewater use can reduce
   productivity and affect lipid composition, but CO2 injection can promote
   both higher biomass and lipid productivities; being Chlorella a
   potential candidate for implementation in industrial facilities once it
   showed high PUFA (around 1/3) and lipid content, up to 27%, grown in
   wastewater. Moreover, it is crucial to seek biomass fractioning to
   obtain different high-value products that will compensate for high
   capital and operating costs. Further evaluation of possible effects in
   the final product quality is required.

AB Purpose of Review: Microalgae-based photosynthetic algal biofuel cells
   (PAMFCs) are effective devices for purifying wastewater and fixing
   carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, converting light energy into
   electricity for integrated bioelectricity, biodiesel feedstock, and
   more. This paper reviewed the great potential of PAMFC for wastewater
   treatment and energy utilization, providing new ideas for wastewater
   treatment and green energy development. Recent Findings: The concept of
   the PAMFC is to convert pollutants into bioelectricity by using the
   metabolic activity of microbial populations in the wastewater, and the
   microalgae at the cathode make it possible to convert solar energy into
   green energy. The construction and type of PAMFC, biotic and abiotic
   factors all have an impact on its wastewater treatment and energy
   production. Considering the above facts, the drawbacks of PAMFC were
   summarized and the future development for its application in wastewater
   treatment and energy use was prospected. Summary: This paper reviewed
   the use of PAMFC systems to recover resources in the form of nutrients,
   bioelectricity, and biodiesel feedstock in wastewater treatment. The
   selection of reactor configuration, cathode and anode materials,
   electrogenic microorganisms, and system optimization conditions were
   analyzed. The limitations of PAMFC in terms of reactor performance and
   scale in practical production applications were discussed and future
   directions for PAMFC were proposed.

AB With increasing concerns about the world's crude oil consumption,
   alternative fuels based on renewable resources attract more and more
   attention. Microalgae have been proposed to be one of the most
   sustainable feedstocks for the production of lipid-based biodiesel.
   Naturally occurring, high-lipid producing microalgae strains can be
   domesticated and further genetically improved in order to redirect
   metabolite fluxes towards increased lipid contents. This review
   summarizes the current knowledge about metabolic engineering of
   microalgae in order to increase the cellular lipid content, with an
   emphasis on triacylglycerols for the production of biofuels.
   Additionally, it outlines the contribution of systems biology and
   genome-scale metabolic pathway modeling, as well as their potential

AB The second messenger cyclic dimeric (3′5′) GMP (cyclic di-GMP or
   c-di-GMP) has been implicated in the transition between motile and
   sessile lifestyles in bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate that
   biofilm formation, cellular aggregation or flocculation, and cellular
   buoyancy are under the control of c-di-GMP in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
   (Synechocystis) and Fremyella diplosiphon. Synechocystis is a
   unicellular cyanobacterium and displays lower levels of c-di-GMP; F.
   diplosiphon is filamentous and displays higher intracellular c-di-GMP
   levels. We transformed Synechocystis and F. diplosiphon with a plasmid
   for constitutive expression of genes encoding diguanylate cylase (DGC)
   and phosphodiesterase (PDE) proteins from Vibrio cholerae or Escherichia
   coli, respectively. These engineered strains allowed us to modulate
   intracellular c-di-GMP levels. Biofilm formation and cellular deposition
   were induced in the DGC-expressing Synechocystis strain which exhibited
   high intracellular levels of c-di-GMP; whereas strains expressing PDE in
   Synechocystis and F. diplosiphon to drive low intracellular levels of
   c-di-GMP exhibited enhanced cellular buoyancy. In addition, the
   PDE-expressing F. diplosiphon strain showed elevated chlorophyll levels.
   These results imply roles for coordinating c-di-GMP homeostasis in
   regulating native cyanobacterial phenotypes. Engineering exogenous DGC
   or PDE proteins to regulate intracellular c-di-GMP levels represents an
   effective tool for uncovering cryptic phenotypes or modulating
   phenotypes in cyanobacteria for practical applications in biotechnology
   applicable in photobioreactors and in green biotechnologies, such as
   energy-efficient harvesting of cellular biomass or the treatment of
   metal-containing wastewaters.

AB Microalgae are renewable feedstock for sustainable biofuel production,
   cell factory for valuable chemicals and promising in alleviation of
   greenhouse gas CO2. However, the carbon assimilation capacity is still
   the bottleneck for higher productivity. Molecular characterization of
   CO2 sequestration and assimilation in microalgae has advanced in the
   past few years and are reviewed here. In some cyanobacteria, genes for
   2-oxoglytarate dehydrogenase was replaced by four alternative mechanisms
   to fulfill TCA cycle. In green algae Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169,
   alternative carbon assimilation pathway was upregulated under high CO2
   conditions. These advances thus provide new insights and new targets for
   accelerating CO2 sequestration rate and enhancing bioproduct synthesis
   in microalgae. When integrated with conventional parameter optimization,
   molecular approach for microalgae modification targeting at different
   levels is promising in generating value-added chemicals from green algae
   and cyanobacteria efficiently in the near future.

AB Some of the key reasons for why the production of biofuels from
   microalgae have not yet succeeded as a source of sustainable transport
   fuel are the costs involved and the amount of energy needed to obtain
   the oils compared to the energy contained in the final fuel. The key
   energy costs are in the dewatering of biomass followed by extraction of
   the oil, disposal of biomass, and the energy content of the nutrient
   fertiliser needed for regrowing the algae. In this study, we bypass all
   of these barriers by using a different approach towards cutting energy
   and fertiliser costs in the production of biofuels from microalgae -
   rather than growing the algae in the presence of fertilisers such as N
   and P, followed by harvesting the whole algae cells, and the
   energetically costly drying of cells and extraction of the fuel from the
   cells, this process makes use of the natural tendency of the green
   alga,Botryococcus brauniito release oils from the cell into the
   extracellular matrix during and after growth. Here, we non-destructively
   and repeatedly harvest the external oil (hydrocarbons) fromB.
   brauniiCCAP 807/2. Extraction with several solvents showed that hexane
   was not compatible withB. braunii, but that heptane in contact withB.
   brauniifor less than 20 min did not negatively affect this alga. As an
   alternative, solvent-free method, we tested physical methods of
   extracting the extracellular oil. Light and temperature did not affect
   the extraction of the external oil fromBotryococcus, but gentle pressure
   (i.e. 'blotting') was an effective method for external oil recovery.
   Less than 1 h of blotting also did not affect the physiology
   ofBotryococcus. Both the heptane extraction and the non-destructive
   'blotting' methods had no significant effect on growth and
   photosynthesis (Fv/Fm, ETRmax) ofB. braunii. Our results indicate that
   over a period of 6 days, we can repeatedly extract over 35% (using
   heptane) and 1% (using 'blotting') of the total oil, mainly in the form
   of external hydrocarbon in stationary phase cells without damage to the
   cells.

AB Spirulina is a potential feedstock for biofuel production and rich
   source of other valuable products such as lipid, reduced sugar and
   protein content. The aim of this study is to achieve the maximum lipid
   yield and other value added products from lipid extracted Spirulina by
   using different techniques. The parameters, pre-treatment of ultra
   sonication, drying techniques and methods of cell disruption techniques
   were studied with respect to the biochemical properties. The cell
   disruption techniques involving temperature and pressure for disruption
   opted were autoclave, microwave and conventional heating processes. The
   techniques were analysed for considerable amount of lipid yield. The
   interaction between drying techniques and pre-treatment with cell
   disruption techniques were also investigated by two way ANOVA. The
   effect on morphology of disrupted cell was observed by scanning electron
   microscopy characterization. The study revealed that the oven dried
   biomass resulted in better yield of protein and lipid as compared to sun
   dried biomass. In case of reduced sugar, the fresh algal cell and
   microwave assisted cell biomass were found to give better yield for sun
   dried biomass. The experimental data revealed that among used methods
   for lipid extraction, the microwave and conventional heating methods
   were found to be the best out of the techniques used for lipid
   extraction and reduced sugar yield.

AB Microalgae can be converted to an energy-dense bio-oil via pyrolysis;
   however, the relatively high nitrogen content of this bio-oil presents a
   challenge for its direct use as fuels. Therefore, hydrothermal
   pretreatment was employed to reduce the N content in Nannochloropsis
   oculata feedstock by removing proteins without requiring significant
   energy inputs. The effects of reaction conditions on the yield and
   composition of pretreated algae were investigated by varying the
   temperature (150-225°C) and reaction time (10-60 min). Compared with
   untreated algae, pretreated samples had higher carbon contents and
   enhanced heating values under all reaction conditions and 6-42% lower N
   contents at 200-225°C for 30-60 min. The pyrolytic bio-oil from
   pretreated algae contained less N-containing compounds than that from
   untreated samples and the bio-oil contained mainly (44.9% GC-MS peak
   area) long-chain fatty acids (C14-C18) which can be more readily
   converted into hydrocarbon fuels in the presence of simple catalysts.

AB The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding by
   surveying patent documents and scientific articles on current progress
   in obtaining biopolymers from microalgae grown in wastewater. Raising
   critical points, current market panorama, trends and perspectives for
   the implementation of the integrated microalgae biorefinery. The
   searches for articles and patents were carried out using the terms
   microalgae, algae, polyhydroxyalkanoate, polymer, and biopolymer. About
   57 patents and 27 articles directly related to the topic were found. The
   USA is the country with the highest number of patents (32), followed by
   the Republic of Korea (12). Companies are the biggest depositors (50%).
   Currently, the focus of research is centered on increasing the
   efficiency of treatments, aiming at large-scale production. Scientific
   articles show that little has been researched on the extraction of
   biopolymers from microalgae grown in wastewater. The ability of
   microalgae to act in the bioremediation of effluents stands out, as well
   as in the production of bioproducts of industrial interest. However,
   there is a gap regarding the economic feasibility of implementing
   current methods to obtain biopolymers, due to the high cost of
   production (2 * current methods). In addition, more research must be
   carried out, seeking to evaluate the techno-economic scenario (focused
   currently on PHB) and bioprospecting new strains to implement the
   integrated biorefinery concept. These are strategies that could increase
   the profitability of this sector, and enabling the use of microalgae to
   obtain biopolymers from effluents is considered a key factor to promote
   an industrial shift.

AB Background: Microalgae are uniquely advantageous organisms cultured and
   harvested for several value-added biochemicals. A majority of these
   compounds are lipid-based, such as triacylglycerols (TAGs), which can be
   used for biofuel production, and their accumulation is most affected
   under nutrient stress conditions. As such, the balance between cellular
   homeostasis and lipid metabolism becomes more intricate to achieve
   efficiency in bioproduct synthesis. Lipidomics studies in microalgae are
   of great importance as biochemical diversity also plays a major role in
   lipid regulation among oleaginous species. Methods: The aim of this
   study was to analyze time-series changes in lipid families produced by
   microalga under different nutrient conditions and growth phases to gain
   comprehensive information at the cellular level. For this purpose, we
   worked with a highly adaptable, oleaginous, non-model green microalga
   species,Ettlia oleoabundans(a.k.a.Neochloris oleoabundans). Using a mass
   spectrometry-based untargeted and targeted metabolomics' approach, we
   analyzed the changes in major lipid families under both replete and
   deplete nitrogen and phosphorus conditions at four different time points
   covering exponential and stationary growth phases. Results:
   Comprehensive analysis of the lipid metabolism highlighted the
   accumulation of TAGs, which can be utilized for the production of
   biodiesel via transesterification, and depletion of chlorophylls and
   certain structural lipids required for photosynthesis, under nutrient
   deprived conditions. We also found a correlation between the depletion
   of digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDGs) and
   sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols (SQDGs) under nutrient deprivation.
   Conclusions: High accumulation of TAGs under nutrient limitation as well
   as a depletion of other lipids of interest such as phosphatidylglycerols
   (PGs), DGDGs, SQDGs, and chlorophylls seem to be interconnected and
   related to the microalgal photosynthetic efficiency. Overall, our
   results provided key biochemical information on the lipid regulation and
   physiology of a non-model green microalga, along with optimization
   potential for biodiesel and other valueadded product synthesis.

AB A biogas slurry composed of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and
   antibiotics was generated. Investigations into the nutrient and
   tetracycline removal performance of four microalgae-based contaminant
   removal technologies, includingChlorella vulgaris,C. vulgarisco-cultured
   with endophytic bacteria,C. vulgarisco-cultured withGanoderma lucidum,
   andC. vulgarisco-cultured withG. lucidumand endophytic bacteria, were
   conducted. The algal-bacterial-fungal consortium with 10-9M
   strigolactone (GR24) yielded the maximum growth rate and average daily
   yield for algae at 0.325  0.03 d-1and 0.192  0.02 g L-1d-1,
   respectively. The highest nutrient/ tetracycline removal efficiencies
   were 83.28  7.95% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 82.62  7.97% for
   total nitrogen (TN), 85.15  8.26% for total phosphorus (TP) and 83.92 
   7.65% for tetracycline. Adding an algal-bacterial-fungal consortium with
   an optimal synthetic analog GR24 concentration is seemingly an
   encouraging strategy for enhancing pollutant removal by algae, possibly
   overcoming the challenges of eutrophication and antibiotic pollution.

AB Background: Numerous strategies have evolved recently for the generation
   of genetically modified or synthetic microalgae and cyanobacteria
   designed for production of ethanol, biodiesel and other fuels. In spite
   of their obvious attractiveness there are still a number of challenges
   that can affect their economic viability: the high costs associated with
   (1) harvesting, which can account for up to 50% of the total biofuel's
   cost, (2) nutrients supply and (3) oil extraction. Fungal-assisted
   bio-flocculation of microalgae is gaining increasing attention due to
   its high efficiency, no need for added chemicals and low energy inputs.
   The implementation of renewable alternative carbon, nitrogen and
   phosphorus sources from agricultural wastes and wastewaters for growing
   algae and fungi makes this strategy economically attractive. Results:
   This work demonstrates that the filamentous fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus
   can efficiently flocculate the unicellular cyanobacteria Synechocystis
   PCC 6803 and its genetically modified derivatives that have been altered
   to enable secretion of free fatty acids into growth media. Secreted free
   fatty acids are potentially used by fungal cells as a carbon source for
   growth and ex-novo production of lipids. For most of genetically
   modified strains the total lipid yields extracted from the
   fungal-cyanobacterial pellets were found to be higher than additive
   yields of lipids and total free fatty acids produced by fungal and
   Synechocystis components when grown in mono-cultures. The synergistic
   effect observed in fungal-Synechocystis associations was also found in
   bioremediation rates when animal husbandry wastewater was used an
   alternative source of nitrogen and phosphorus. Conclusion: Fungal
   assisted flocculation can complement and assist in large scale biofuel
   production from wild-type and genetically modified Synechocystis PCC
   6803 strains by (1) efficient harvesting of cyanobacterial cells and (2)
   producing of high yields of lipids accumulated in fungal-cyanobacterial
   pellets.

AB The exploitation of petrochemical hydrocarbons is compromising ecosystem
   and human health and biotechnological research is increasingly focusing
   on sustainable materials from plants and, to a lesser extent,
   microalgae. Fatty acid derivatives include, among others, oxylipins,
   hydroxy fatty acids, diols, alkenones, and wax esters. They can occur as
   storage lipids or cell wall components and possess, in some cases,
   striking cosmeceutical, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical properties. In
   addition, long chain (>20) fatty acid derivatives mostly contain highly
   reduced methylenic carbons and exhibit a combustion enthalpy higher than
   that of C14-20 fatty acids, being potentially suitable as biofuel
   candidates. Finally, being the building blocks of cell wall components,
   some fatty acid derivatives might also be used as starters for the
   industrial synthesis of different polymers. Within this context,
   microalgae can be a promising source of fatty acid derivatives and, in
   contrast with terrestrial plants, do not require arable land neither
   clean water for their growth. Microalgal mass culturing for the
   extraction and the exploitation of fatty acid derivatives, along with
   products that are relevant in nutraceutics (e.g., polyunsaturated fatty
   acids), might contribute in increasing the viability of microalgal
   biotechnologies. This review explores fatty acids derivatives from
   microalgae with applications in the field of renewable energies,
   biomaterials and pharmaceuticals. Nannochloropsis spp.
   (Eustigmatophyceae, Heterokontophyta) are particularly interesting for
   biotechnological applications since they grow at faster rates than many
   other species and possess hydroxy fatty acids and aliphatic cell wall
   polymers.

AB Producing biodiesel from microalgae is a promising strategy to upgrade

   synthesis of Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus) cultivated in synthetic
   wastewater with different carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios regulated by
   ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate (NO3--N), separately, were investigated.
   The results shown that SO42- could dramatically increase cell growth
   preferring to NH4+-N supply. And SO42- addition could improve its carbon
   and nitrogen utilization potential for boosting lipid productivity
   leading alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n3) to occupy a dominant component
   (38.96%) in NH4+-N group at a C/N ratio of 7.5. Additionally, SO42-
   could enhance the enrichment and expression of up-regulated genes
   annotated in key enzymes such as GK, GNPAT, CRLS, plc and DEGS involved
   in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolic
   pathways, resulting in carbon metabolism enhancement and sulfatide
   accumulation. This study brings a comprehensive view towards nutritional

AB Microalgae and cyanobacteria are promising sources of biodiesel because
   of their high oil content (10 fold higher) and shorter cultivation time
   (4 fold lesser) than conventional oil producing territorial plants
   (e.g., soybean, corn and jatropha). These organisms also provide source
   of several valuable natural chemicals including pigments, food
   supplements like eicosapentanoic acid [EPA], decosahexaenoic acid [DHA]
   and vitamins. In addition, many cellular components of these organisms
   are associated with therapeutic properties like antioxidant,
   anti-inflammatory, immunostimulating, and antiviral. Isolation and
   identification of high-yielding strains with the faster growth rate is
   the key for successful implementation of algal biodiesel (or other
   products) at a commercial level. A number of research groups in Europe,
   America, and Australia are thus extensively involved in exploration of
   novel microalgal strain. Further, genetic engineering provides a tool to
   engineer the native strain resulting in transgenic strain with higher
   yields. Despite these efforts, no consensus has yet been reached so far
   in zeroing on the best microalgal strain for sustainable production of
   biofuel at reasonable cost. The search for novel microalgal strain and
   transgenesis of microalgae, are continuing side by side with the hope of
   commercial scale production of microalgae biofuel in near future.
   However, no consolidated review report exists which guides to isolate
   and identify a uncontaminated microalgal strain along with their
   transgenesis. The present review is focused on: (i) key factors for
   sample collection, isolation, and identification to obtain a pure
   microalgal species, (ii) present status for isolation of microalgal
   strains worldwide based on geographical location and habitat, (iii) the
   current research for application of genetic engineering tools for
   enhanced production of biodiesel and value added chemicals, and (iv) the
   comparison of different cultivation systems for genetically modified
   strain.

AB Microalgae are now the focus of intensive research because of their
   potential as a renewable feedstock for biofuel production. This review
   briefly examines the effect of reactor design, nutrient, and light
   regimens on microalgae productivity and macromolecular composition.
   Downstream processing including common biofuel production as well as
   life cycle assessment and technoeconomical aspects are discussed. Even
   though algal biofuels are more environmentally friendly than fossil
   fuels, economical feasibility is a challenging issue.

AB Due to increasing anthropogenic activities, especially industry and
   transport, the fossil fuel demand and consumption have increased
   proportionally, causing serious environmental issues. This attracted
   researchers and scientists to develop new alternative energy sources .
   Therefore, this review covers the biofuel production potential and
   challenges related to various feedstocks and advances in process
   technologies. It has been concluded that the biofuels such as biodiesel,
   ethanol, bio-oil, syngas, Fischer-Tropsch H2, and methane produced from
   crop plant residues, micro- and macroalgae and other biomass wastes
   using thermo-bio-chemical processes are an eco-friendly route for an
   energy source. Biofuels production and their uses in industries and
   transportation considerably minimize fossil fuel dependence. Literature
   analysis showed that biofuels generated from energy crops and microalgae
   could be the most efficient and attractive process. Recent progress in
   the field of biofuels using genetic engineering has larger perspectives
   in commercial-scale production. However, its large-scale production is
   still challenging; hence, to resolve this problem, it is essential to
   convert biomass in biofuels by developing novel technology to increase
   biofuel production to fulfil the current and future energy demand.

AB To mitigate global warming caused by burning fossil fuels, a renewable
   energy source available in large quantity is urgently required. We are
   proposing large-scale photobiological H2production by mariculture-raised
   cyanobacteria where the microbes capture part of the huge amount of
   solar energy received on earth's surface and use water as the source of
   electrons to reduce protons. The H2production system is based on
   photosynthetic and nitrogenase activities of cyanobacteria, using uptake
   hydrogenase mutants that can accumulate H2for extended periods even in
   the presence of evolved O2. This review summarizes our efforts to
   improve the rate of photobiological H2production through genetic
   engineering. The challenges yet to be overcome to further increase the
   conversion efficiency of solar energy to H2also are discussed.

AB Background: The utilization of biomass from microalgae for biofuel
   production is one of the key elements for the development of a
   sustainable and secure energy supply. Among the different
   microalgae,Chlorellaspecies are of interest because of their high
   productivity, high lipid content, and resistance to the high light
   conditions typical of photobioreactors. However, the economic
   feasibility of growing algae at an industrial scale is yet to be
   realized, in part because of biological constraints that limit biomass
   yield. A key issue is the inefficient use of light due to uneven light
   distribution, and the dissipation of excess absorbed light as heat. The
   successful implementation of biofuel production facilities requires the
   development of algal strains with enhanced light use efficiency in
   photobioreactors. Such domestication strategies include decreasing the
   absorption cross section in order to enhance light penetration,
   increasing the size of metabolic sinks per chlorophyll and minimizing
   feedback energy dissipation. Results: In this work we applied random
   mutagenesis and phenotypic selection to the thermotolerant,
   fast-growingChlorellaspecies,C. sorokiniana. Truncated antenna mutants
   (TAMs) were selected that exhibited a lower fluorescence yield than the
   wild-type (WT) strain. Six putatively interesting mutants were selected
   by high throughput fluorescence video imaging, two of which, TAM-2 and
   TAM-4, were found to have approximately half the chlorophyll content per
   cell and LHCII complement per PSII with respect to the WT. In batch
   culture, TAM-2 showed an increased photon use efficiency, yielding a
   higher Pmaxat saturating irradiances with respect to the WT. Cultivation
   of TAM-2 in both laboratory-scale and outdoor photobioreactors showed
   higher productivity than WT, with a 30% higher biomass yield in dense
   cell suspensions typical of industrial photobioreactors. Conclusions:
   These results suggest that generation of mutants with low chlorophyll
   content can significantly improve the light-to-biomass conversion
   efficiency ofC. sorokinianaunder mass culture conditions. However, owing
   to the lack of sexual reproduction in this species, the presence of
   additional mutations might affect growth rate, suggesting that selection
   should include evaluation of multiple independent mutants for each
   desired phenotype.

AB Photoautotrophic microbes present vast opportunities for sustainable
   lipid production, CO2storage and green chemistry, for example, using
   microalgae beds to generate biofuels. A major challenge of microalgae
   cultivation and other photochemical reactors is the efficiency of light
   delivery. In order to break even on large scale, dedicated photon
   management will be required across all levels of reactor hierarchy -
   from the harvesting of light and its efficient injection and
   distribution inside of the reactor to the design of optical antenna and
   pathways of energy transfer on molecular scale. Here, we discuss a
   biomimetic approach for light dilution which enables homogeneous
   illumination of large reactor volumes with high optical density. We show
   that the immersion of side-emitting optical fiber within the reactor can
   enhance the fraction of illuminated volume by more than two orders of
   magnitude already at cell densities as low as 5 104ml-1. Using the green
   algaeHaematococcus pluvialisas a model system, we demonstrate an
   increase in the rate of reproduction by up to 93%. Beyond micoralgae,
   the versatile properties of side-emitting fiber enable the injection and
   dilution of light with tailored spectral and temporal characteristics
   into virtually any reactor containment.

AB Photosynthetic organisms possess regulatory mechanisms to balance the
   various inputs of photosynthesis in a manner that minimizes
   over-excitation of the light-driven electron transfer apparatus, while
   maximizing the reductive assimilation of inorganic nutrients, most
   importantly inorganic carbon (Ci). Accordingly, the regulatory
   interactions coordinating responses to fluctuating light and responses
   to Ci availability are of fundamental significance. The inducible high
   affinity carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) in the cyanobacterium
   Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 has been studied in order to understand how it
   is integrated with the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis. To
   probe genetic regulatory mechanisms, genomic DNA microarrays were used
   to survey for differences in the expression of genes in response to a
   shift to high light conditions under conditions of either high or low Ci
   availability. Discrepancies in published experiments exist regarding the
   extent to which genes for the CCM are upregulated in response to high
   light treatment. These discrepancies may be due to critical differences
   in Ci availability existing during the different high light experiments.
   The present microarray experiments reexamine this by comparing high
   light treatment under two different Ci regimes: bubbling with air and
   bubbling with air enriched with CO2. While some transcriptional
   responses such as the downregulation of antenna proteins are quite
   similar, pronounced differences exist with respect to the differential
   expression of CCM and affiliated genes. The results are discussed in the
   context of a recent analysis revealing that small molecules that are
   intermediates of the light and dark reaction photosynthetic metabolism
   act as allosteric effectors of the DNA-binding proteins which modulate
   the expression of the CCM genes.

AB A conceptual analysis of coupling a concentrating solar power plant with
   a biorefinery process consisting in the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)
   of microalgae to biocrude was performed. The configuration of the
   CSP-HTL plant was designed to allow continuous operation considering 10
   kT of microalgae processed each year using, for the first time, a
   ternary nitrate mixture as heat transfer fluid and storage medium in the
   temperature range of 340-410°C. With adopted models, the capital and
   operating costs of the solar plant marginally affect the minimum fuel
   selling prize (MFSP) of biocrude that decreases with the size of the
   solar field and of the thermal storage system provided that the scale of
   CS plant is large enough. A MFSP of the biocrude of 2.19 US$/kg was
   estimated that is quite similar to that reported in the literature for
   more conventional processes of HTL of microalgae with capability similar
   to that considered in this study. This value for the MFSP is lower than
   that calculated for the same HTL plant in which part of the produced
   biocrude is used as bio-fuel to drive the process. These results
   indicate that the utilization of solar heat in an indirect solar reactor
   could be an interesting option to improve sustainability of the
   processes and to store solar energy in biofuels.

AB The major challenges for industrial commercialized biodiesel production
   from microalgae are the high cost of downstream processing such as
   dewatering and drying, utilization of large volumes of solvent and
   laborious extraction processes. In order to address these issues the
   microwave irradiation method was used to produce biodiesel directly from
   wet microalgae biomass. This alternative method of biodiesel production
   from wet microalgae biomass is compared with the conventional water
   bath-assisted solvent extraction. The microwave irradiation extracted
   more lipids and high biodiesel conversion was obtained compared to the
   water bath-assisted extraction method due to the high cell disruption
   achieved and rapid transesterification. The total content of lipid
   extracted from microwave irradiation and water bath-assisted extraction
   were 38.31% and 23.01% respectively. The biodiesel produced using
   microwave irradiation was higher (86.41%) compared to the conventional
   method. Thus microwave irradiation is an attractive and promising
   technology to be used in the extraction and transesterification process
   for efficient biodiesel production.

AB Real-time studies highlighting the actual bottlenecks of
   microalgae-based biofuels are needed to overcome the limitations of
   assumption-based approach. In the present study, an algal consortium
   consisting ofChlorella pyrenoidosaandPhormidium, was cultivated in
   municipal wastewater under outdoor conditions in a pilot scale (100 L)
   attached biofilm reactor during January-February 2018. No energy was
   used to maintain the cultivation conditions (temperature, light
   intensity/duration). After 6 days of hydraulic retention time, the
   consortium showed 53-87% reduction in the nutrients' concentrations of
   the selected wastewater. Consistent biomass productivity of 3.48  0.44 g
   m-2d-1was observed, and its biochemical composition showed that it was
   rich in lipids (35.20  0.63% of total solids). The wastewater grown
   algal biomass was subjected to anaerobic digestion at 37°C for 30 days
   and hydrothermal liquefaction at 27 bars and 230°C for 20 min to produce
   biomethane or biocrude, respectively. On performing the biomethane
   potential assay, a cumulative biomethane production of 346.59  5 mL
   g-1VS was observed. The theoretical methane production and
   stoichiometric methane potential calculated for the biomass was 504 mL
   g-1VS and 591 mL g-1VS, respectively, showing a digestibility of 58.5%.
   Hydrothermal liquefaction of the wastewater grown biomass gave biocrude
   yield of 43  2% (dried biomass basis) rich in aldehydes/ketones/fatty
   acids. Net energy ratios for the two processes were compared. Net energy
   ratio for algal cultivation integrated with anaerobic digestion was
   found to be 0.007 and for that with hydrothermal liquefaction was found
   to be 0.08, proving it to be a more energy efficient process.

AB Photoautotrophic microalgae such as the marine microalgaNannochloropsis,
   are unicellular organisms able to synthesise valuable lipids for
   application in food, aquaculture, agriculture and bioenergy. Their rigid
   cell walls limit the extraction of lipids. Therefore enzyme-assisted
   disruption (EAD) methods are often used to increase the lipid extraction
   yield. While EAD ofNannochloropsiscan increase lipid extraction yield,
   the enzyme and solvent selection, as well as treatment conditions vary
   considerably in the literature. This review gives an overview of recent
   literature on EAD ofNannochloropsisto increase lipid extraction yield.
   Our aim is to provide guidelines and good practises for enzyme
   selection, pre-treatment and post-treatments, which can be extrapolated
   to other oleaginous microalgae.

AB Biogas production using algal resources has been widely studied as a
   green and alternative renewable technology. This review provides an
   extended overview of recent advances in biomethane production via direct
   anaerobic digestion (AD) of microalgae, macroalgae and co-digestion
   mechanism on biomethane production and future challenges and prospects
   for its scaled-up applications. The effects of pretreatment in the
   preparation of algal feedstock for methane generation are discussed
   briefly. The role of different operational and environmental parameters
   for instance pH, temperature, nutrients, organic loading rate (OLR) and
   hydraulic retention time (HRT) on sustainable methane generation are
   also reviewed. Finally, an outlook on the possible options towards the
   scale up and enhancement strategies has been provided. This review could
   encourage further studies in this area, to intend and operate continuous
   mode by designing stable and reliable bioreactor systems and to analyze
   the possibilities and potential of co-digestion for the promotion of
   algal-biomethane technology.

AB The decrease of petroleum reserves and the global increase in energy
   demand has resulted in the focus of research toward exploration of
   alternate fuels using biological renewable sources. Biodiesel is one of
   these renewable energy forms. Microalgae are considered one of the most
   promising sources for biodiesel production. However, the potential use
   of microalgae in this field still needs to be explored since only about
   twenty species has been studied from the approximately 30.000 known
   species. Thereby, screening work on new potentially lipid overproducer
   strains is actually an active field. An overview of potential
   applications of multi-parameter flow cytometry in development of a
   biodiesel production strategy using microalgae is detailed in this
   review. Rapid and simultaneous measurements of different physiological
   parameters indicating diversity in marine and freshwater microalgal
   communities, biomass quality such as biochemical composition and
   viability of individual cells, isolation of targeted cells and obtention
   of axenic cultures are applications of flow cytometry that enable
   monitoring and optimisation of production of lipids from microalgae.

AB In the current global scenario, the world is under a serious dilemma due
   to the increasing human population, industrialization, and urbanization.
   The ever-increasing need for fuels and increasing nutritional problems
   have made a serious concern on the demand for nutrients and renewable
   and eco-friendly fuel sources. Currently, the use of fossil fuels is
   creating ecological and economic problems. Microalgae have been
   considered as a promising candidate for high-value metabolites and
   alternative renewable energy sources. Microalgae offer several
   advantages such as rapid growth rate, efficient land utilization, carbon
   dioxide sequestration, ability to cultivate in wastewater, and most
   importantly, they do not participate in the food crop versus energy crop
   dilemma or debate. An efficient microalgal biorefinery system for the
   production of lipids and subsequent byproduct for nutraceutical
   applications could well satisfy the need. But, the current microalgal
   cultivation systems for the production of lipids and nutraceuticals do
   not offer techno-economic feasibility together with energy and
   environmental sustainability. This review article has its main focus on
   the production of lipids and nutraceuticals from microalgae, covering
   the current strategies used for lipid production and the major
   high-value metabolites from microalgae and their nutraceutical
   importance. This review also provides insights on the future strategies
   for enhanced microalgal lipid production and subsequent utilization of
   microalgal biomass.

AB Microalgae cultivation with high lipid productivity has received much
   attention in recent years owing to the economic potential of biofuels
   production and CO2 emission reduction. Previous studies had reported
   that the ways of pH-regulation, nutrition-limitation and semi-continuous
   culture mode can either increase the cells growth rate or promote lipid
   accumulation. In this study, the novel culture strategy of integrating
   both nutrition limitation and pH-regulation by CO2 in a semi-continuous
   cultivation was investigated for enhancing the lipid productivity. In
   the batch culture, the best growth performance was achieved by
   controlling pH at 7; lipid contents of the cells can be increased under
   the nitrogen-limitation conditions. The maximum lipid productivity of
   115 mg L-1 d-1 was achieved in the novel culture strategy of
   semi-continuous cultivation with nitrogen-limitation and pH-regulation
   by CO2, which was 3.64-fold higher than that in the batch culture
   without pH control and nitrogen limitation.

AB Cyanobacteria can be utilized as a potential biocatalyst for the
   production of biofuels and biochemicals directly from CO2. Useful
   mutants of cyanobacteria, which can grow rapidly or are resistant to
   specific metabolic products, are essential to improve the productivity
   of biofuels. In this study, we developed a single cell culture system to
   effectively screen mutant cyanobacteria using magnetite nanoparticles
   and magnetic force. Lens culinaris Agglutinin (LCA) was selected as a
   lectin, which binds to the surface of Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942
   cells and the LCA-conjugated magnetite cationic liposomes (MCLs) were
   developed for magnetic labeling of PCC7942 cells. The MCL-labeled
   PCC7942 cells were magnetically patterned at a single cell level by
   using 6,400 iron pillars of the pin-holder device. The device enabled
   1,600 single cells to be arrayed in one square centimeter. We cultured
   the patterned cells in liquid medium and achieved higher colony-forming
   ratio (78.4%) than that obtained using conventional solid culture method
   (4.8%). Single cells with different properties could be distinguished in
   the single cell culture system depending on their growth. Furthermore,
   we could selectively pick up the target cells and subsequently perform
   efficient isolation culture. The ratio of successful isolation culture
   using the developed method was 13 times higher than that of the
   conventional methods. Thus, the developed system would serve as a
   powerful tool for screening mutant cyanobacteria.

AB Olive milling produces huge amounts of wastewater (OMWW) characterized
   by an extremely high organic load. Its polyphenols content is a
   hindrance to conventional biological treatment and to using it as
   growing medium for common microbial biomasses. The practice to dump it
   on soil is in conflict with the latest EU directives about waste
   management. OMWW can be effectively and efficiently treated by means of
   membrane technology to a fraction of the initial volume, but membrane
   processing concentrates still require treatment. Reversing the overall
   cost balance of membrane processing and subsequent treatment requires
   valorizing the concentrates through their reuse, as well as ensuring
   long-term service of the membrane system through effective wastewater
   pretreatment and sustainable, fouling-controlling, membrane operation
   conduite. Aim of this work is to reuse and valorize the ultra- and
   nanofiltration membrane concentrates as media for biomass production of
   microalgae and cyanobacteria.Scenedesmus dimorphusandArthrospira
   platensis, usable as a food, feed, nutraceutical component or feedstock
   for biofuels, were selected for this investigation. Microalgal growth
   was experimentally determined and related to the composition of the
   concentrate-based media and to the irradiance distribution within the
   photobioreactor volume to decouple light limitation and medium chemical
   composition effects.

U2 170
AB Microalgae have been intensively studied as a source of biomass for
   replacing conventional fossil fuels in the last decade. The optimization
   of biomass production, harvesting and downstream processing is necessary
   for enabling its full-scale application. Regarding biofuels, biogas
   production is limited by the characteristics of microalgae, in
   particular the complex cell wall structure of most algae species.
   Therefore, pretreatment methods have been investigated for microalgae
   cell wall disruption and biomass solubilization before undergoing
   anaerobic digestion. This paper summarises the state of the art of
   different pretreatment techniques used for improving microalgae
   anaerobic biodegradability. Pretreatments were divided into 4
   categories: (i) thermal; (ii) mechanical; (iii) chemical and (iv)
   biological methods. According to experimental results, all of them are
   effective at increasing biomass solubilization and methane yield,
   pretreatment effect being species dependent. Pilot-scale research is
   still missing and would help evaluating the feasibility of full-scale
   implementation.

AB Background: Microalgae in the genusNannochloropsisare photosynthetic
   marine Eustigmatophytes of significant interest to the bioenergy and
   aquaculture sectors due to their ability to efficiently accumulate
   biomass and lipids for utilization in renewable transportation fuels,
   aquaculture feed, and other useful bioproducts. To better understand the
   genetic complement that drives the metabolic processes of these
   organisms, we present the assembly and comparative pangenomic analysis
   of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes fromNannochloropsis salina
   CCMP1776. Results: The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes ofN.
   salinaare 98.4% and 97% identical to their counterparts
   inNannochloropsis gaditana. Comparison of theNannochloropsispangenome to
   other algae within and outside of the same phyla revealed regions of
   significant genetic divergence in key genes that encode proteins needed
   for regulation of branched chain amino synthesis (acetohydroxyacid
   synthase), carbon fixation (RuBisCO activase), energy conservation (ATP
   synthase), protein synthesis and homeostasis (Clp protease, ribosome).
   Conclusions: Many organellar gene modifications inNannochloropsisare
   unique and deviate from conserved orthologs found across the tree of
   life. Implementation of secondary and tertiary structure prediction was
   crucial to functionally characterize many proteins and therefore should
   be implemented in automated annotation pipelines. The exceptional
   similarity of theN. salinaandN. gaditanaorganellar genomes suggests
   thatN. gaditanabe reclassified as a strain ofN. salina.

AB Microalgae are a promising feedstock for renewable biofuel to replace
   traditional fossil energy. However, one of the major challenges of the
   commercialization of microalgal biofuels is the efficient and economical
   harvest of microalgal biomass. Foam flotation, a high-efficiency
   separation technique originating from the mineral industry, has been
   adopted recently for potential application in harvesting microalgal
   biomass. This work critically reviews the principles and current status
   of microalgal harvesting using foam flotation by summarizing the
   advantages and challenges as well as the influence of biotic and abiotic
   factors, analyzing the economic feasibility, and proposing some new
   techniques as well as future research needs, using an illustrative
   process flow diagram. This work expands our understanding of microalgal
   harvesting using foam flotation, which may expedite the research and
   application of foam flotation in the downstream processing of microalgal
   biomass for the production of biofuel and bioproducts.

AB Cyanobacteria are Gram-negative bacteria that can undertake oxygenic
   photosynthesis. This ancient group of microorganisms is ubiquitous,
   occurs in freshwater, marine, cold, hot, and terrestrial habitats. Can
   survive on a minimum requirement of light, carbon dioxide (CO2), and
   water, and able to fix the atmospheric N2 are among of their unique
   characteristics. These have collectively offered these bio-agents as the
   precious bio-resource for sustainable development. A variety of
   cyanobacterial strains promise further advances in biotechnology,
   including as an alternative source of energy. Before its final use,
   cyanobacteria undergo several necessary bioprocesses, including strain
   isolation and selection. This study aims to isolate and identify
   culturable-cyanobacteria from several habitats in Segara Anakan,
   Cilacap, Indonesia. The current study is an outset step to obtain
   potential and suitable agents for biofuel production. Morphological
   identification using light microscopy showed that cyanobacteria found in
   samples from different habitats varied. There are 39 cyanobacterial
   isolates obtained from freshwater, brackish water, and
   rhizosphere-mangrove soil habitats. Some cyanobacteria are unicellular
   (Order Chroococcales, Synechococcales, Pleurocapcales), the others are
   filamentous cyanobacteria (Order Oscillatoriales). These cyanobacteria
   grow well on BG-11 media. Numerous re-streakings on fresh medium and
   treatments of ampicillin and nystatin as antibiotic and antifungal,
   respectively, were carried out to obtain pure cultures. The
   classification of cultured cyanobacteria has been problematic and
   complicated. The polyphasic approach was applied to justify the
   taxonomic classification of the isolates. It is a combination of
   different methods based on modern molecular, cytomorphological, and
   ecological methods.

AB Microalgae are an important source of oils and other molecules that can
   be used as feedstocks to produce biofuels and high-value products,
   having the potential of becoming a significant renewable energy source.
   However, large scale production of microalgal biofuels faces numerous
   technical challenges, which makes the current growth and development of
   the microalgae biorefinery industry, still economically unviable. This
   study reviewed the recently released information regarding the upstream
   methodologies involved in an algae-based biofuels production system. The
   better understanding of the conversion of light to biomass, the analysis
   of the productivities of the most recent culture systems, the use of
   waste waters as alternative sources of nutrients, and the co-location of
   the algae biomass production process to an industry are among the
   approaches that have been proposed to track the challenges in the
   development of a biorefinery system based on microalgae; these have been
   analyzed critically in this work.

AB Microalgae has the capability to replace petroleum-based fuels and is a
   promising option as an energy feedstock because of its fast growth, high
   photosynthetic capacity and remarkable ability to store energy reserve
   molecules in the form of lipids and starch. But the commercialization of
   microalgae based product is difficult due to its high processing cost
   and low productivity. Higher accumulation of these molecules may help to
   cut the processing cost. There are several reports on the use of various
   omics techniques to improve the strains of microalgae for increasing the
   productivity of desired products. To effectively use these techniques,
   it is important that the glycobiology of microalgae is associated to
   omics approaches to essentially give rise to the field of algal
   glycobiotechnology. In the past few decades, lot of work has been done
   to improve the strain of various microalgae such as Chlorella,
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Botryococcus braunii etc., through genome
   sequencing and metabolic engineering with major focus on significantly
   increasing the productivity of biofuels, biopolymers, pigments and other
   products. The advancements in algae glycobiotechnology have highly
   significant role to play in innovation and new developments for the
   production algae-derived products as above. It would be highly desirable
   to understand the basic biology of the products derived using -omics
   technology together with biochemistry and biotechnology. This review
   discusses the potential of different omic techniques (genomics,
   transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to improve the yield of
   desired products through algal strain manipulation.

AB A recent review paper considers the potential of algal biomass as a
   source of liquid and gaseous biofuels, but there are a number of issues
   concerning the results and conclusions presented. These include the
   biomass energy values, which in some cases are unusually high; and the
   apparent production of more energy from processed biomass than is
   present in the original material. The main causes for these
   discrepancies include the choice of empirical formula for protein;
   confusion between values calculated on a total or volatile solids basis;
   and the lack of a mass balance approach. The choice of protein formula
   also affects predicted concentrations of ammonia in the digester. These
   and other minor errors contribute to some potentially misleading
   conclusions which could affect subsequent interpretations of the overall
   process feasibility.

AB The high rate of depletion of fossil fuels and the negative effects
   caused by their use in industries and combustion engines are calling for
   biofuels. Alternatively, plant, algae and microbes are renewable
   biomasses for the generation of biofuels. Choosing a suitable biomass is
   of great importance for biofuel generation in good quantity and quality.
   Recently, molecular genetics has been implemented to increase biofuel
   productivity by improving desirable traits in plants, algae and
   microbes. Here, we review biofuel feedstocks with focus on
   lignocellulose, algae and microbes for production of biofuels, biogas
   and biohydrogen. We present genetic engineering approaches. Microalgae
   appear as the most promising species for combined biofuel production,
   wastewater treatment and CO2fixation. Metabolic engineering can improve
   algal and microbial strains for the production of biofuels. Residual
   algal biomass can be recycled for the generation of other products.

AB World-wide, an emerging demand is moving towards the biofuels to replace
   the fossil fuels. In alternative biofuel production strategies,
   cyanobacteria have unique characteristic of accumulating glycogen,
   lipid, and fuel molecules through natural mechanisms. Moreover, the
   cyanobacteria can be easily engineered to synthesis a plenty of fuel
   molecules from CO2. To obtain the fuel molecule from cyanobacteria,
   various techniques were invented in which the metabolic engineering is
   found to be a prerequisite to develop an economically feasible process.
   The expression of indigenous or heterologous pathways plays an important
   role in developing successful production process. In addition, the
   engineering of photosynthetic apparatus, destruction of competitive
   pathways and improvement of tolerance were also proven to improve the
   product specific synthesis. Although various metabolic engineering
   approaches have been developed, there are certain obstacles when it
   comes to implementation for the production. In this review, the
   important biosynthetic pathways for biofuels, alteration of other genes
   to improve the actual pathway and possibilities of developing

AB Algae are an important group of photosynthetic autotrophs and are
   commonly found in different types of water bodies, including paddy
   fields. The algal group possesses distinctive characteristics and ranges
   from prokaryotic cyanobacteria to eukaryotic algae. Within these,
   microalgae are unicellular microorganisms widely distributed in
   saltwater as well as freshwater environments. Microalgae species have
   been utilized in different fields, especially animal and human
   nutrition, medicine, bioremediation, and bio-fertilizers. Recently,
   numerous studies have reported the importance of microalgae in the
   production of biofuel. Further, microalgae have great carbon dioxide
   fixation efficiency during growth, so farmable land is not required for
   cultivating microalgae. Microalgae biomass production is a three-step
   process: cultivation, harvesting, and processing. Of these, the
   harvesting process is considered challenging due to its high cost, and
   it directly affects the processing step. In addition, several factors
   influence the harvesting process, including the size of microalgae cells
   (<30 m), cultural conditions of microalgae, electronegative property of
   cell membrane, growth rate, etc. The harvesting of microalgae is an
   elaborate process that involves different chemical or mechanical
   approaches. A number of harvesting techniques have been utilized to
   recover algal biomass, such as membrane filtration, chemical and
   bio-flocculation, flotation centrifugation, sedimentation, and
   coagulation. In this context, this review aims to discuss various types
   of techniques used for harvesting microalgae. This review could be
   useful for selecting appropriate harvesting technology for enhancing the
   yield of microalgae biomass.

AB The flocculation process is commonly used to separate suspended solids
   from water. The microalgae strain,Picochlorum oklahomensis(PO), was
   investigated for its flocculation characteristics. Efficiencies of
   biopolymer addition, pH adjustment and electroflocculation for biomass
   recovery from the culture medium were examined. Flocculation efficiency
   of PO increased sharply above pH 11 and reached 97% at pH 13. Chitosan
   was more effective in flocculating PO cells than sodium alginate and
   cationic starch. A generalized linear mixed model using a beta
   distribution for response was utilized for optimization of the chitosan
   flocculation process variables. Biomass: chitosan ratio, pH and settling
   time (ST) were the independent variables. There were significant 3-way
   interactions among the variables. The highest PO flocculation
   efficiency, 98.4%, was obtained at biomass: chitosan ratio of 2.78, pH 9
   and ST of 12 h. The electroflocculation efficiency improved with
   increasing current, operation time (OT) and ST. The highest
   electroflocculation efficiency, 99.74%, was obtained under the following
   conditions; 0.8 A (ampere) and 15 min and 12 h, OT and ST, respectively.
   This study demonstrated that pH adjustment, chitosan addition and
   electroflocculation were all technically viable methods to flocculate PO
   cells. However, selection of the most suitable technique and the optimum
   treatment conditions needs to be based not only on the application of
   algal biomass, but also on an economic feasibility study.

AB This review discusses anaerobic production of methane, hydrogen,
   ethanol, butanol and electricity from microalgal biomass. The
   amenability of microalgal biomass to these bioenergy conversion
   processes is compared with other aquatic and terrestrial biomass
   sources. The highest energy yields (kJ g-1 dry wt. microalgal biomass)
   reported in the literature have been 14.8 as ethanol, 14.4 as methane,
   6.6 as butanol and 1.2 as hydrogen. The highest power density reported
   from microalgal biomass in microbial fuel cells has been 980 mW m-2.
   Sequential production of different energy carriers increases attainable
   energy yields, but also increases investment and maintenance costs.
   Microalgal biomass is a promising feedstock for anaerobic energy
   conversion processes, especially for methanogenic digestion and ethanol
   fermentation. The reviewed studies have mainly been based on laboratory
   scale experiments and thus scale-up of anaerobic utilization of
   microalgal biomass for production of energy carriers is now timely and
   required for cost-effectiveness comparisons.

AB Microalgae enable fixation of CO2into carbohydrates, lipids, and
   proteins through inter and intracellularly biochemical pathways. These
   cellular components can be extracted and transformed into renewable
   energy, chemicals, and materials through biochemical and thermochemical
   transformation processes. However, recalcitrant cell wall and lack of
   environmentally benign efficient pretreatment processes are key
   obstacles in the commercialization of microalgal biorefineries. Thus,
   current article describes the microalgal chemical structure, type, and
   structural rigidity and summarizes the traditional pretreatment methods
   to extract cell wall constituents. Green solvents such as ionic liquid
   (ILs), deep eutectic solvents (DES), and natural deep eutectic solvents
   (NDESs) have shown interesting solvent characteristics to pretreat
   biomass with selective biocomponent extraction from microalgae. Further
   research is needed in task-specific IL/DES design, cation-anion
   organization, structural activity understanding of ILs-biocomponents,
   environmental toxicity, biodegradability, and recyclability for
   deployment of carbon-neutral technologies. Additionally, coupling the
   microalgal industry with biorefineries may facilitate waste management,
   sustainability, and gross revenue.

AB Microalgae have attracted growing attention due to their potential in
   biofuel feedstock production. However, current understanding of the
   regulatory mechanisms for lipid biosynthesis and storage in microalgae
   is still limited. This study revealed that the microalga Chlorella
   sorokiniana showed sequential accumulation of starch and lipids. When
   nitrogen was replete and/or depleted over a short period, starch was the
   predominant carbon storage form with basal levels of lipid accumulation.
   After prolonged nitrogen depletion, lipid accumulation increased
   considerably, which was partially due to starch degradation, as well as
   the turnover of primary metabolites. Lipid accumulation is also strongly
   dependent on the linear electron flow of photosynthesis, peaking at
   lower light intensities. Collectively, this study reveals a relatively
   clear regulation pattern of starch and lipid accumulation that is
   basically controlled by nitrogen levels. The mixotrophic growth of C.
   sorokiniana shows promise for biofuel production in terms of lipid
   accumulation in the final biomass.

AB Water shortage is one of the leading global problems along with the
   depletion of energy resources and environmental deterioration. Recent
   industrialization, global mobility, and increasing population have
   adversely affected the freshwater resources. The wastewater sources are
   categorized as domestic, agricultural and industrial effluents and their
   disposal into water bodies poses a harmful impact on human and animal
   health due to the presence of higher amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus,
   sulfur, heavy metals and other organic/inorganic pollutants. Several
   conventional treatment methods have been employed, but none of those can
   be termed as a universal method due to their high cost, less efficiency,
   and non-environment friendly nature. Alternatively, wastewater treatment
   using microalgae (phycoremediation) offers several advantages over
   chemical-based treatment methods. Microalgae cultivation using
   wastewater offers the highest atmospheric carbon fixation rate (1.83 kg
   CO2/kg of biomass) and fastest biomass productivity (40-50% higher than
   terrestrial crops) among all terrestrial bio-remediators with
   concomitant pollutant removal (80-100%). Moreover, the algal biomass may
   contain high-value metabolites including omega-3-fatty acids, pigments,
   amino acids, and high sugar content. Hence, after extraction of
   high-value compounds, residual biomass can be either directly converted
   to energy through thermochemical transformation or can be used to
   produce biofuels through biological fermentation or transesterification.
   This review highlights the recent advances in microalgal biotechnology
   to establish a biorefinery approach to treat wastewater. The
   articulation of wastewater treatment facilities with microalgal
   biorefinery, the use of microalgal consortia, the possible merits, and
   demerits of phycoremediation are also discussed. The impact of
   wastewater-derived nutrient stress and its exploitation to modify the
   algal metabolite content in view of future concerns of cost-benefit
   ratios of algal biorefineries is also highlighted.

AB The last decade has witnessed a tremendous impetus on biofuel research
   due to the irreversible diminution of fossil fuel reserves for enormous
   demands of transportation vis-a-vis escalating emissions of green house
   gasses (GHGs) into the atmosphere. With an imperative need of CO2
   reduction and considering the declining status of crude oil, governments
   in various countries have not only diverted substantial funds for
   biofuel projects but also have introduced incentives to vendors that
   produce biofuels. Currently, biodiesel production from microalgal
   biomass has drawn an immense importance with the potential to exclude
   high-quality agricultural land use and food safe-keeping issues.
   Moreover, microalgae can grow in seawater or wastewater and microalgal
   oil can exceed 50-60% (dry cell weight) as compared with some best
   agricultural oil crops of only 5-10% oil content. Globally, microalgae
   are the highest biomass producers and neutral lipid accumulators
   contending any other terrestrial oil crops. However, there remain many
   hurdles in each and every step, starting from strain selection and lipid
   accumulation/yield, algae mass cultivation followed by the downstream
   processes such as harvesting, drying, oil extraction, and biodiesel
   conversion (transesterification), and overall, the cost of production.
   Isolation and screening of oleaginous microalgae is one pivotal
   important upstream factor which should be addressed according to the
   need of freshwater or marine algae with a consideration that wild-type
   indigenous isolate can be the best suited for the laboratory to large
   scale exploitation. Nowadays, a large number of literature on microalgal
   biodiesel production are available, but none of those illustrate a
   detailed step-wise description with the pros and cons of the upstream
   and downstream processes of biodiesel production from microalgae.
   Specifically, harvesting and drying constitute more than 50% of the
   total production costs; however, there are quite a less number of
   detailed study reports available. In this review, a pragmatic and
   critical analysis was tried to put forward with the on-going researches
   on isolation and screening of oleaginous microalgae, microalgal large
   scale cultivation, biomass harvesting, drying, lipid extraction and
   finally biodiesel production.

AB Oleaginous microalgae are capable of producing large quantities of fatty
   acids and triacylglycerides. As such, they are promising feedstocks for
   the production of biofuels and bioproducts. Genetic strain-engineering
   strategies offer a means to accelerate the commercialization of algal
   biofuels by improving the rate and total accumulation of microalgal
   lipids. However, the industrial potential of these organisms remains to
   be met, largely due to the incomplete knowledgebase surrounding the
   mechanisms governing the induction of algal lipid biosynthesis. Such
   strategies require further elucidation of genes and gene products
   controlling algal lipid accumulation. In this study, we have set out to
   examine these mechanisms and identify novel strain-engineering targets
   in the oleaginous microalga, Chlorella vulgaris. Comparative shotgun
   proteomic analyses have identified a number of novel targets, including
   previously unidentified transcription factors and proteins involved in
   cell signaling and cell cycle regulation. These results lay the
   foundation for strain-improvement strategies and demonstrate the power
   of translational proteomic analysis.

AB Microalgae are an attractive feedstock for biofuel production, however
   the harvesting of algal biomass from very large volumes of culture broth
   represents a major technological and economic challenge. One low cost
   strategy for addressing this challenge involves the use of flocculation
   as an initial dewatering step. In this study, flocculation of the green
   microalga Chlorella sorokiniana was explored in detail using the natural
   compound, chitosan as flocculant. Results show that clarification
   efficiency of the process can reach above 99% below pH 7. The optimal
   chitosan dosage (approximately 10 mg per gram algal dry weight) is
   determined primarily by cell concentration rather than cell age, lipid
   content or composition of the medium. Furthermore, the impact of
   flocculation on the subsequent dewatering process was determined and it
   was shown to reduce the volume to be processed by 20-50 folds, and
   significantly reduce energy input and material costs of centrifugation
   or filtration operations.

AB The adverse impacts of fossil fuels on the environment, specifically
   climate change, have intensified the need for finding a sustainable
   alternative source of energy. Numerous studies have postulated that
   biotechnology development, focusing on biofuel production processes,
   could be a suitable solution for sustainable energy production. The
   utilization of microorganisms, such as microalgae, is one of the basic
   strategies to produce biodiesel, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals.
   Co-cultivation has overtaken mono-cultivation to improve the production
   of microalgae due to its endurance, foreseeability, and stability.
   However, further development of the co-cultivation process requires
   elaborate efforts to make it safe, practical, and optimal. Some dominant
   factors affecting the co-culture system control are the diversity of the
   cell groups, mass transfer, scale-up, population ratio, and time. In
   this review article, we will discuss some critical topics related to the
   co-cultivation process, such as data collection, modelling, cultivation
   methods, and interaction varieties. An overview of the quantification
   techniques for biomass concentration and lipid content is also provided.
   Moreover, the utilization of microalgal co-cultures will be analyzed,
   depicting the difficulties associated with their efficient control. As
   knowledge of the reactions and their entailing kinetics is elemental for
   analyzing the microalgal systems, which are used to synthesize
   intermediate products and chemicals, some studies focusing on the
   kinetics of microalgal biomass conversion into biofuels are presented.
   Since the microbial fuel cells (MFCs), as a new bioelectrochemical
   process, are utilized in the mixed-culture systems to treat wastewater
   and produce biofuels and other valuable by-products, a summary of the
   microalgal MFCs is also provided. Finally, arguments about the
   challenges and advantages of the co-cultivation systems are presented.

AB The demand for aquafeed is expected to increase in the coming years and
   new ingredients will be needed to compensate for the low fish meal and
   oil availability. Microalgae represent a promising matrix for the future
   aquafeed formulation, however, the high production cost hinders its
   application. The use of microalgae from biorefinery would reduce the
   disposal costs for microalgae production. The present study aimed to (i)
   verify the growth of microalgae on digestate coming from pig farming and
   (ii) evaluate their potential valorization as dietary ingredient in
   aquafeed according to a Circular Bioeconomy approach. For these
   purposes, a microalgae biomass was produced on an outdoor raceway
   reactor supplied with digestate and used for partial replacement (10% of
   the diet) in aquafeed for Siberian sturgeon fingerlings (Acipenser
   baerii). The results obtained confirm the feasibility for growing
   microalgae on digestate with satisfactory productivity (6.2 gDM m-2d-1),
   nutrient removal efficiency and Chemical Oxygen Demand reduction;
   moreover, the feeding trial carried out showed similar results between
   experimental and control groups (p> 0.05), in term of growth
   performance, somatic indices, fillet nutritional composition and
   intestinal functionality, to indicate that microalgae from biorefinery
   could be used as protein source in Siberian sturgeon aquafeed.

AB Background: Under nitrogen deficiency situation, Nannochloropsis spp.
   accumulate large amounts of lipids in the form of triacylglycerides
   (TAG). Mechanisms of this process from the perspective of transcriptome
   and metabolome have been obtained previously, yet proteome analysis is
   still sparse which hinders the analysis of dynamic adaption to nitrogen
   deficiency. Here, proteomes for 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 10th day
   of nitrogen deplete (N-) and replete (N+) conditions were obtained and
   integrated with previous transcriptome data for N. oceanica. Results:
   Physiological adaptations to N- not apparent from transcriptome data
   were unveiled: (a) abundance of proteins related to photosynthesis only
   slightly decreased in the first 48 h, indicating that photosynthesis is
   still working efficiently, and protein amounts adjust gradually with
   reduction in chloroplast size. (b) Most proteins related to the TCA
   cycle were strongly upregulated after 48 h under N-, suggesting that
   respiration is enhanced after 48 h and that TCA cycle efflux supports
   the carbon required for lipid synthesis. (c) Proteins related to lipid
   accumulation via the Kennedy pathway increased their abundance at 48 h,
   synchronous with the previously reported diversification of fatty acids
   after 48 h. Conclusions: This study adds a proteome perspective on the
   major pathways for TAG accumulation in Nannochloropsis spp. Temporal
   changes of proteome exhibited distinct adaptation phases that are
   usually delayed relative to transcriptomic responses. Notably, proteome
   data revealed that photosynthesis and carbon fixation are still ongoing
   even after 48 h of N-. Moreover, sometimes completely opposite trends in
   proteome and transcriptome demonstrate the relevance of underexplored
   post-transcriptional regulation for N- adaptation.

   However, these cell constituents showed the highest values in the C+N
   grown cells, but the lipid content was found to be the highest glutamate
   grown cells. FTIR analysis of Lipid/Carbohydrate and Lipid/Protein ratio
   and flow cytometric analysis of neutral lipids revealed higher lipid
   content in the glutamate grown cells than in the nitrogen starved,
   nitrate and C+N grown cells. The nitrate reductase activity was the
   highest in the C+ N grown cells and the lowest activity was found in the
   glutamate grown cells. A corollary of these results suggested that
   suppression of nitrogen assimilatory system, whether by glutamate or by
   nitrogen deprivation, was the most suitable physiological condition for
   enhanced lipid synthesis and biofuel production in microalgal cells.

AB The Sustainable Development Goal 2 of the United Nations towards 2030
   aimed to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and
   promote sustainable agriculture. According to the 2023 report by the
   Food and Agriculture Organization, the world is not on track to end
   hunger or promote sustainable agriculture by that time. Climate change
   acts as a "crisis multiplier", resulting in lower food productivity and
   higher prices, contributing further to poverty, hunger, and instability.
   The number of undernourished people in drought-sensitive and low-income
   regions of the world has increased this decade. In this review, we
   analyze the potential of microalgae and cyanobacteria to aid
   conventional agriculture in providing critical services such as carbon
   capture, wastewater management, food/feed, biofuels, and other higher
   value bioproducts. Specifically, we focus on the use of filamentous
   N2-fixing cyanobacteria for providing those benefits, even in semidry
   regions of the world with limited access to affordable nitrogen
   fertilizers to boost crop productivity. We comprehensively consider the
   eco-physiological basis of this potential, and the available alternative
   technologies for large-scale biomass production. We analyze venues for
   filamentous N2-fixing cyanobacteria applications in standalone
   processes, or integrated into more complex industrial symbioses, towards
   increased crop productivity, and water and N-fertilizer use efficiency.
   Throughout the text, we highlight aspects which still require further
   optimization, or technological breakthroughs, for full realization of
   the potential of filamentous N2-fixing cyanobacteria for contributing to
   Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Energy is the utmost requirement for driving the organization and
   maintenance of entire ecosystem. Our continued dependency on fossil
   fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas as the prime source of
   energy has led to serious concerns about the future energy supply and
   security. Furthermore, over-consumption of carbon-based fossil energy
   sources raises serious environmental issues of global warming and
   climate change. To overcome the global energy demand and to enable
   economic as well as ecological development in a sustainable manner,
   technological progress for the utilization of renewable natural energy
   are essential to protect the environment and save energy in today's
   increasingly competitive world. To this end, algal biofuels are being
   claimed as an apt alternative energy source and in recent past, several
   taxonomic groups of algae have been studied and reported as an
   alternative to fossil fuels. It is envisaged that algal biomass could be
   readily processed into the raw material to make cost-effective biofuels
   and is being explored as an emergent and renewable green energy crops
   for the production of biofuels, especially biodiesel. Development of
   astonishing technological innovations in the field of algal genetic
   engineering has triggered remarkable output across the global energy
   sector for better biofuels. Several new techniques are being adopted for
   large-scale farming of microalgae intended for biofuel production.
   However, there are certain constraints for commercial-scale energy
   production from algae. The present review discusses the technological
   development and current information on the cultivation and process of
   biodiesel production form algae. Also, discussed are the technological
   development and genomic insights into the algal biomass and
   triacylglycerol accumulation for enhanced biodiesel production.

AB This study investigates the prospective of utilizing kitchen wastewater
   and food wastes, biofuels industry byproducts as alternative water and
   carbon sources. Kitchen wastewater did not impede cellular growth rate
   of the evolved Phaeodactylum strain E70, which indicates its potential
   as an alternative to freshwater resources. Among the organic wastes
   assessed, food waste hydrolysate significantly increased cell growth.
   Supplement of crude glycerol in cultivation medium enhances the total
   fatty acid content. Mixed food waste hydrolysate and crude glycerol
   remarkably increased both the cell density and total fatty acid content.
   Also, the supplement of butylated hydroxytoluene alleviated the
   oxidative stress induced by impurities in organic wastes and
   concomitantly increased microalgal total fatty acids and polyunsaturated
   fatty acids content. The experimental results reported in this study
   show that a waste-based biorefinery could lead to utilization of organic
   waste resources for the efficient production of value-added products.

AB Microalgae hold promise as a sustainable source of biofuels and
   bioproducts but their commercial development is impeded by high
   cultivation costs, primarily for growth nutrients, and concerns about
   the water-intensive nature of algae cultivation. As a result, minimizing
   water and nutrient input is imperative to reducing algal operating
   costs, while enhancing the sustainability of future algal biorefineries.
   However, spent media recycling often results in the accumulation of
   growth inhibitors, such as free fatty acids, polysaccharides,
   polyunsaturated aldehydes, and humic acid, which negatively affect algal
   growth and productivity. In this review, we critically assess media
   recycling research findings to assess the advantages and disadvantages
   of spent media reuse for a wide range of algae strains. Particular
   emphasis is placed on strategies to overcome growth inhibition through
   spent media treatment processes, such as ultraviolet oxidation,
   activated carbon, ultrasonication, microfiltration, crop rotation, and
   nutrient replenishment.

AB Microalgae are autotrophic microorganisms having extremely high
   photosynthetic efficiency and are valued as rich source of lipids,
   hydrocarbons, and other complex oils for biodiesel besides being an
   invaluable source of bioethanol, biomethane, and biohydrogen. Biodiesel
   produced from oilseed crops such as jatropha and soy have lower yields
   per unit land area and threaten food security. Indeed, microalgae have
   higher oil yields amounting to about 40 times more oil per unit area of
   land in comparison to terrestrial oilseed crops such as soy and canola.
   Further, microalgae production does not require arable land for
   cultivation. Biofuel is regarded as a proven clean energy source and
   several entrepreneurs are attempting to commercialize this renewable
   source. Technology for producing and using biofuel has been known for
   several years and is frequently modified and upgraded. In view of this,
   a review is presented on microalgae as second generation biofuel.
   Microalgal farming for biomass production is the biggest challenge and
   opportunity for the biofuel industry. These are considered to be more
   efficient in converting solar energy into chemical energy and are
   amongst the most efficient photosynthetic plants on earth. Microalgae
   have simple cellular structure, a lipid-rich composition, and a rapid
   rate of reproduction. Many microalgal strains can be grown in saltwater
   and other harsh conditions. Some autotrophic microalgae can also be
   converted to heterotrophic ones to accumulate high quality oils using
   organic carbon. However, there are several technical challenges that
   need to be addressed to make microalgal biofuel profitable. The
   efficiency of microalgal biomass production is highly influenced by
   environmental conditions, e.g., light of proper intensity and
   wavelength, temperature, CO2concentration, nutrient composition,
   salinities and mixing conditions, and by the choice of cultivation
   systems: open versus closed pond systems, photobioreactors. Currently,
   microalgae for commercial purpose are grown mostly in open
   circular/elongated "raceway" ponds which generally have low yields and
   high production costs. However, a hybrid system combining closed
   photobioreactor and open pond is a better option. The biggest hurdle in
   commercialization of microalgal biofuel is the high cost and energy
   requirement for the microalgal biomass production, particularly
   agitation, harvesting, and drying of biomass. In order to conserve
   energy and reduce costs, algae are often harvested in a two-step process
   involving flocculation followed by centrifugation, filtration, or
   micro-straining to get a solid concentration. However, the major
   bottlenecks in algal biodiesel production within the cell can be
   identified and handled by adopting a system approach involving
   transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Research and developments
   in the field of new materials and advanced designs for cultivation in
   closed bioreactors, use of waste water for biomass production, screening
   of efficient strains, high-value coproduct strategy, and cutting-edge
   metabolic engineering are thought to provide the biggest opportunities
   to substantially improve the cost effectiveness of such production
   systems.

AB Microalgal biomass as feedstock for biofuel production is an attracting
   alternative to terrestrial plant utilization for biofuels production.
   However, today the microalgal cultivation systems for energy production
   purposes seem not yet to be economically feasible. Microalgae, though
   cultivated under stress conditions, such as nutrient starvation, high
   salinity, high temperatureetc.accumulate considerable amounts (up to
   60-65% of dry weight) of lipids or carbohydrates along with several
   secondary metabolites. Especially some of the latter are valuable
   compounds with an enormous range of industrial applications. The
   simultaneous production of lipids or carbohydrates for biofuel
   production and of secondary metabolites in a biorefinery concept might
   allow the microalgal production to be economically feasible. This paper
   aims to provide a review on the available literature about the
   cultivation of microalgae for the accumulation of high-value compounds
   along with lipids or carbohydrates focusing on stress cultivation
   conditions.

AB The understanding of process parameters and limiting conditions on

   chemostat cultivation. In this study, the factors limiting growth of
   axenic Chlorella vulgaris OW-01 in cylindrical photobioreactor under
   chemostat cultivation were overcome in two phases. Physiological and
   physicochemical analyses determined inorganic carbon, phosphorous and
   light intensity as major limiting factors. Their effect on system
   productivity was ascertained and optimized in the first phase resulting
   in maximum biomass and lipid productivities of 538 and 128 (mg/L/d),
   respectively. In the second phase, the effect of dilution rate was
   evaluated under optimized conditions. The biomass and lipid
   productivities in this phase reached to 1013 and 270 (mg/L/d),
   respectively at a dilution rate of 0.75 d-1, yielding >10-fold
   cumulative increase in productivities. The study demonstrates addressing

   chemostat cultivation to achieve high biomass and lipid productivities
   in photobioreactors.

AB There is an urgent need to develop sustainable solutions to convert

   solar fuels, with molecular hydrogen being an interesting and promising
   option. Native and engineered cyanobacteria have been used as model

   with respect to native biological systems to generate hydrogen,
   metabolic modulations, and genetic engineering of metabolic pathways, as
   well as the introduction of custom-designed, non-native enzymes and
   complexes for enhanced hydrogen production in cyanobacteria. In
   conclusion, metabolic and genetic engineering of native cyanobacterial
   hydrogen metabolism can significantly increase the hydrogen production.
   Introduction of custom-designed non-native capacities open up new

   biocrude production and CO2capture. The microalga was cultivated in a
   3-m2raceway pond with manual agitation, 10-m2raceway ponds with and
   without CO2supplementation and a 120-m2pond with CO2supplementation
   using carbonation column reactor (CCR). During the above experiments,
   the areal productivities obtained ranged from 7.5 to 34.4 g m-2d-1and
   the lipid content was between 29 and 80%. This study also demonstrated a
   novel 10 KLPD (kilolitres per day) capacity electropreciflocculation
   (ePF) reactor (~0.56-0.78 KWh/KL) and filter press for biomass
   harvesting with 98.24% efficiency. The CO2capture ofN. Salinaestimated
   was in the range of 45.38-208.12 tons ha-1y-1, and the average was 95.39
   tons ha-1y-1. The cost estimated based on the 120-m2pond trials was
   $3.46/kg of dry algal biomass . Thus the findings provide immense scope
   for future research on large-scale cultivation ofNannochloropsis
   salinafor biofuel production and carbon capture applications.

AB This study explores microalgae-based bioremediation for treating black
   gunpowder production effluents, an understudied yet environmentally
   significant stream. Two native microalgae,Chlorellasp. MC18 (CH)
   andScenedesmussp. MJ23-R (SC), were assessed for growth kinetics and
   nutrient removal capabilities in culture media containing different
   proportions of untreated raw wastewater. Results show both species
   thrived in 100% raw wastewater, displaying robust growth and substantial
   biomass production in parallelepiped-shaped photobioreactors. SC showed
   superior performance, with higher maximum specific growth rate (0.549
   d-1), biomass yield (454.57 mg L-1) and biomass productivity (64.94 mg
   L-1d-1) compared to CH (0.524 d-1, 380.60 mg L-1, 54.37 mg L-1d-1,
   respectively). The use of 100% raw wastewater as a culture medium
   eliminated the need for additional freshwater input, thus reducing the
   water footprint. The bioremediation process also resulted in a high
   removal efficiency in turbidity (>95% CH, >76% SC), total suspended
   solids (>93% CH, >74% SC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) (>62% CH,
   >93% SC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (>63% CH, >87% SC), bringing
   the effluent into compliance with environmental regulations. Although
   nitrogen (>45% CH, >57% SC) and sulphate (>43% CH, >35% SC) removal
   efficiencies was high, potassium bioremediation was limited (<6%). The
   proximate chemical composition of the microalgal biomass revealed
   different allocations to carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. The results
   suggest promising applications for biofuel production and aquaculture.
   This research highlights the potential of microalgae-based
   bioremediation for sustainable wastewater management in the explosives
   industry, contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and
   promoting green industrial practices.

AB The production of biofuels using wastewater as a microalgae culture
   medium is a little explored technology, but with potential for success.
   In order to contribute to the knowledge of these technologies and their
   technical feasibility for microalgae growth, in this work
   theChlorellasp. strain was cultivated in two types of effluents
   generated in an experimental farm located in eastern Colombia, before
   and after a biological treatment process. The consumption of the main
   nutrients that regulate growth and lipid production was evaluated, in
   order to extract, quantify, characterize and convert them into
   biodiesel. The results showed thatChlorellasp. growth and lipid
   production is more favourable in R2 medium of treated water than in R1
   medium of raw water, mainly due to phosphorus limitation and higher
   N-NO3concentration in R2 compared to R1. In the R2 medium culture, a
   percentage of 42.54% of long-chain fatty acids was found, which is
   necessary to obtain a high quality biodiesel. Finally, the best
   transesterification experiment allowed reaching a fatty acid methyl
   esters (FAME) percentage of 90.1  2.7%. In general, the results
   demonstrated the potential viability of using the wastewater generated
   in the San Pablo farm to produce biomass with lipid content to obtain
   biodiesel, finding that where the concentration of nutrients, mainly
   nitrogen, has a great influence on the microalgal metabolism for lipid
   accumulation.

AB Hydrogen production through the metabolic bypass of microalgae
   photosynthesis is an environmentally friendly method. This review
   examines the genetic differences in hydrogen production between
   prokaryotic and eukaryotic microalgae. Additionally, the pathways for
   enhancing microalgae-based photosynthetic hydrogen generation are
   summarized. The main strategies for enhancing microalgal hydrogen
   production involve inhibiting the oxygen-generating process of
   photosynthesis and promoting the oxygen tolerance of hydrogenase. Future
   research is needed to explore the regulation of physiological metabolism
   through quorum sensing in microalgae to enhance photosynthetic hydrogen
   production. Moreover, effective evaluation of carbon emissions and
   sequestration across the entire photosynthetic hydrogen production
   process is crucial for determining the sustainability of
   microalgae-based production approaches through comprehensive lifecycle
   assessment. This review elucidates the prospects and challenges
   associated with photosynthetic hydrogen production by microalgae.

AB Rapid development of hydroponic farming which is soilless cultivation
   method of growing plant using mineral nutrient solution dissolved in
   water produces large amount of wastewater rich in nutrients and organic
   matters thus imposes great harms to human and environment, if the waste
   nutrient solution is not correctly treated. The objective of this review
   is to present information concerning hydroponic systems, including: the
   different classes and methods of operation; advantages and drawbacks and
   the recent approaches and development in hydroponic wastewater
   treatments. Particular emphasis has been placed on removal of root
   exudates from reused waste nutrient solution in closed system. The
   reviewed technologies for nutrient removal or recovery include
   denitrification, microalgae cultivation, constructed wetlands and
   activated carbon methods. The alternatives byproducts i.e. biogas as
   agriculture fertilizer for hydroponic cultivation to attain sustainable
   agriculture was further highlighted. In addition, current challenges and
   future prospects in this field are carried out. About 118 published
   studies are reviewed in this paper. It is evident from the literature
   survey articles that activated carbon is the most frequently studied for
   the nutrient recovery of hydroponic wastewater.

U2 41
AB For the sustainable development of the environment, to reduce the high
   cost and low productivity of microalgae biofuel, nine microalgae strains
   were screened to study the growh and nutrient removal properties under
   heterotrophic culture by using the waste carbon source of volatile fatty
   acids (VFAs). Chlorella sorokiniana (C.sorokiniana) was selected as the
   best strain with the highest biomass concentration of 0.77 g L-1,
   specific growth rate of 0.25 d-1, biomass productivity of 91.43 mg L-1
   d-1, total nitrogen removal efficiency of 95.96% and total phosphorus
   removal efficiency of 93.42%. To study the utilization potential of
   acid-producing wastewater by heterotrophic microalgae, actual
   acid-producing wastewater was recycled three times for the utilization
   of C.sorokiniana. After the three utilization cultivation, the removal
   rates of COD, total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and total phosphorus
   were 74.44%, 88.05%, 79.08%, and 82.69%, respectively. The total
   utilization rates of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were
   58.99%, 70.54%, and 81.52%, respectively. In addition, the highest lipid
   content of 39.15% and protein content of 42.43% achieved at the third
   cultivation. After the first cultivation, the composition and diversity
   of the microbial community structure changed dramatically, with
   Protebacteria, Bacteroidota, Hydrogenophaga, and Algoriphagus becoming
   enriched. These results showed a promising way of coupling wastewater
   treatment with biomass production for long-term sustainability of
   microalgae lipid production.

   country, China is striving to develop a range of renewable energy
   sources. Here, we performed an informatics analysis to monitor the
   development of microalgal biofuels in China by analyzing energy policies
   related to microalgal biomass and biofuel production and funding inputs
   and scientific research projects in this field. China has already made
   substantial contributions to the microalgal biofuel industry worldwide.
   Despite recent declines in research and investment due to the overall
   economic environment, microalgal energy research and applications
   technologies have tremendous prospects. We summarize progress in
   research on microalgal biomass and biofuel production, focusing on
   microalgal culture patterns and the production of energy, including
   efforts in China to promote the industrialization of microalgal
   biofuels. Finally, we explore possible solutions to bottlenecks that
   must be overcome before microalgal biofuels can be widely used and
   discuss future prospects. In addition to serving as a theoretical
   reference for researchers and decision makers in China and beyond, the
   information presented in this review article can be used to guide the

AB Microalgal biofuels offer great promise in contributing to the growing
   global demand for alternative sources of renewable energy. However, to
   make algae-based fuels cost competitive with petroleum, lipid production
   capabilities of microalgae need to improve substantially. Recent
   progress in algal genomics, in conjunction with other "omic" approaches,
   has accelerated the ability to identify metabolic pathways and genes
   that are potential targets in the development of genetically engineered
   microalgal strains with optimum lipid content. In this review, we
   summarize the current bioeconomic status of global biofuel feedstocks
   with particular reference to the role of "omics" in optimizing
   sustainable biofuel production. We also provide an overview of the
   various databases and bioinformatics resources available to gain a more
   complete understanding of lipid metabolism across algal species, along
   with the recent contributions of "omic" approaches in the metabolic
   pathway studies for microalgal biofuel production.

   from renewable materials became one of the important ways to solve the
   energy issues. Among of them, the production of biodiesel by
   oil-producing microalgae had regained much attention in the field of
   biomass energy. The development process of microalgae biodiesel at home
   and abroad and the breeding conditions of algae species in large-scale
   cultivation were introduced. Furthermore, the key technologies and the
   main problems in large-scale cultivation of algae species were
   investigated. The development trend and challenges were also reviewed.

AB Through metabolic coupling of methane oxidation and oxygenic
   photosynthesis, methanotroph-photoautotroph (M-P) cocultures offer a
   highly promising technology platform for biogas conversion. However,
   there has not been any quantitative modeling of the coculture growth
   kinetics. This is mainly due to the inherent difficulty associated with
   real time characterization of the M-P cocultures and the complex
   interactions such as the cross-feeding mechanism within the coculture.
   To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel
   experimental-computational (E-C) protocol to accurately characterize the
   M-P coculture in real-time, and validated its accuracy through cell
   counting. Enabled by the E-C protocol, this work presents the very first
   kinetic model for M-P cocultures. By explicitly modeling the exchange of
   in situ produced O2/CO2 within the M-P coculture and coupling the
   individual biomass growth with mass transfer between the gas and liquid
   phases, the semi-structured kinetic model accurately predicts the growth
   dynamics of the M-P coculture under a wide range of growth conditions.
   The proposed model is validated by a series of wet-lab experiments using
   Methylomicrobium buryatense 5 GB1 - Arthrospira platensis as the model
   coculture. Although it has been speculated that there may exist other
   emergent metabolic interactions within the M-P coculture, in addition to
   the exchange of in situ produced O2/CO2, there has not been any
   experimental validation prior to this study. By integrating designed
   experiments with the semi-structured kinetic model, this study is the
   first to confirm the existence of the additional emergent metabolic
   exchanges within the coculture. Moreover, this study further quantifies
   the effect of these unknown metabolic interactions on the growth of both
   species in the model coculture, supporting further research to identify
   these exchanged metabolites for metabolic engineering.

AB Microalgae serve as a promising source for the production of biofuels
   and bio-based chemicals. They are superior to terrestrial plants as
   feedstock in many aspects and their biomass is naturally rich in lipids,
   carbohydrates, proteins, pigments, and other valuable compounds. Due to
   the relatively slow growth rate and high cultivation cost of microalgae,
   to screen efficient and robust microalgal strains as well as genetic
   modifications of the available strains for further improvement are of
   urgent demand in the development of microalgae-based biorefinery. In
   genetic engineering of microalgae, transformation and selection methods
   are the key steps to accomplish the target gene modification. However,
   determination of the preferable type and dosage of antibiotics used for
   transformant selection is usually time-consuming and
   microalgal-strain-dependent. Therefore, more powerful and efficient
   techniques should be developed to meet this need. In this review, the
   conventional and emerging genome-editing tools (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9,
   TALEN, and ZFN) used in editing the genomes of nuclear, mitochondria,
   and chloroplast of microalgae are thoroughly surveyed. Although all the
   techniques mentioned above demonstrate their abilities to perform gene
   editing and desired phenotype screening, there still need to overcome
   higher production cost and lower biomass productivity, to achieve
   efficient production of the desired products in microalgal
   biorefineries.

AB Algae biomass-fed wastewaters are a promising source of lipid and
   bioenergy manufacture, revealing substantial end-product investment
   returns. However, wastewaters would contain lytic pathogens carrying
   drug resistance detrimental to algae yield and environmental safety.
   This study was conducted to simultaneously decipher through
   high-throughput advanced Illumina 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene
   sequencing, the cultivable and uncultivable bacterial community profile
   found in a single sample that was directly recovered from the local
   wastewater systems. Samples were collected from two previously
   documented sources including anaerobically digested (AD) municipal
   wastewater and swine wastewater with algae namelyChlorellaspp. in
   addition to control samples, swine wastewater, and municipal wastewater
   without algae. Results indicated the presence of a significant level
   ofBacteriain all samples with an average of approximately 95.49%
   followed byArchaea2.34%, in local wastewaters designed for algae
   cultivation. Taxonomic genus identification indicated the presence
   ofCalothrix,Pseudomonas, andClostridiumas the most prevalent strains in
   both local municipal and swine wastewater samples containing algae with
   an average of 17.37, 12.19, and 7.84%, respectively. Interestingly,
   swine wastewater without algae displayed the lowest level
   ofPseudomonasstrains < 0.1%. The abundance of somePseudomonasspecies in
   wastewaters containing algae indicates potential coexistence between
   these strains and algae microenvironment, suggesting further
   investigations. This finding was particularly relevant for the earlier
   documented adverse effects of some nosocomialPseudomonasstrains on algae
   growth and their multidrug resistance potential, requiring the
   development of targeted bioremediation with regard to the beneficial
   flora.

AB This review aims to perform an updated bibliographical survey on the
   cultivation of microalgae in domestic wastewater with a focus on
   biotechnological aspects. It was verified that the largest number of
   researches developed was about cultures in microalgae-bacteria
   consortium and mixed cultures of microalgae, followed by researches
   referring to the speciesChlorella vulgarisand to the family
   Scenedesmaceae. According to published studies, these microorganisms are
   efficient in the biological treatment of domestic wastewater, as well as
   in the production of high value-added biomass, as they are capable of
   biosorbing the organic and inorganic compounds present in the culture
   medium, thus generating cells with high levels of lipids, proteins, and
   carbohydrates. These compounds are of great importance for different
   industry sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, food, and also for
   agriculture and aquaculture. In addition, biomolecules produced by
   microalgae can be extracted for several biotechnological applications;
   however, most studies focus on the production of biofuels, with
   biodiesel being the main one. There are also other emerging applications
   that still require more in-depth research, such as the use of biomass as
   a biofertilizer and biostimulant in the production of bioplastic.
   Therefore, it is concluded that the cultivation of microalgae in
   domestic wastewater is a sustainable way to promote effluent
   bioremediation and produce valuable biomass for the biobased industry,
   contributing to the development of technology for the green economy.

AB Biogas production has been suggested as a valid valorization solution
   for microalgal/bacteria biomass (MAB) grown on wastewater. This research
   is aimed at assessing the feasibility to use MAB grown in an outdoor
   raceway fed on piggery wastewater for biogas production. Batch and
   continuous anaerobic tests were conducted on the sole MAB and on a blend
   of MAB and carbonaceous substrates (deproteinated cheese whey and
   cellulose) to improve the carbon/nitrogen ratio. Results of batch
   biochemical methane potential tests confirmed that the sole
   microalgal/bacteria biomass was poorly degradable (119 NmLCH4.gCOD-1),
   while blending it with deproteinated cheese whey or cellulose (80% of
   carbonaceous material and 20% of MAB, as chemical oxygen demand (COD))
   had no synergistic effects on the methane yield, although slight
   improvements in the degradation kinetics were observed. Continuous
   anaerobic degradation tests (at an organic loading rate of 1.5
   gCOD.L-1.d-1, 35°C and 30 days of hydraulic retention time) increased
   the overall methane yield from 81 NmLCH4.gCOD-1 (sole MAB) to 216
   NmLCH4.gCOD-1 (MAB and deproteinated cheese whey) and 122 NmLCH4.gCOD-1
   (MAB and cheese whey). However, data confirm that no evident synergistic
   effects were obtained.

   high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency (67.5  1%) in
   MFC-Algae showed that harmful algal biomass could be converted into
   bioelectricity. Polarization curves revealed that MFC-Algae delivered
   the maximum power density (83 mW/m2) and current density (672 mA/m2),
   which was 43% and 45% higher than that of MFC-Acetate respectively.
   Improved electrochemical performance and substantial coulombic
   efficiency (7.6%) also verified the potential use of harmful algal
   biomass as an alternate MFC substrate. Diverse microbial community
   profiles showed the substrate-dependent electrogenic activities in each
   MFC. Biodegradation pathway of MC-LR by anodic microbes was also
   explored in detail. Briefly, a sustainable approach for on-site waste
   management of harmful algal biomass was presented, which was deprived of
   transportation and special pretreatments. It is anticipated that current
   findings will help to pave the way for practical applications of MFC
   technology.

AB As global temperatures continue to increase the move to renewable energy
   sources is becoming an essential step in achieving a sustainable future.
   Biofuels from microalgae, while still more expensive to produce than
   fossil fuels, are of great interest for the high microalgae biomass
   growth rates, high lipid content, relatively low water requirements, and
   ability to be grown on non-arable land. Botryococcus braunii is a
   freshwater green microalga which grows in colonies supported by an
   extracellular matrix (ECM) of liquid hydrocarbons. Recent studies have
   investigated the efficiency of non-destructive in situ solvent
   extraction of lipids from B. braunii with a variety of solvents. These
   lipids are encapsulated in a retaining wall coated by a sheath of
   amphiphilic fibrils which have been found to act as a barrier to
   solvents. By carrying out repeated in situ solvent extraction in a high
   shear environment, we found that access to the ECM can be significantly
   improved. Sustainable botryococcene and total lipid productivities
   respectively of 29.9  8.5 and 71.3  20.3 mg L-1 day-1 were achieved with
   heptane extraction, a shear rate of 415 s-1, initial culture density of
   1.62  0.12 g L-1, contact period of 4 h, and a recovery period of 3
   days. Nutrient supplementation to replace those lost in the emulsion
   entrained biomass will be required to maintain a sustainable process.
   The combined presence of heptane with high shear proved to be an
   effective colony disruption method which could be an effective
   pre-treatment followed by a low shear, high solvent contact, and
   extraction method.

AB The cultivation of microalgae in domestic wastewater offers a
   sustainable solution for the treatment of effluents, while at the same
   time producing biomass rich in lipids, potentially usable in the
   production of biofuels. Furthermore, reuse contributes to the treatment
   of wastewater, transforming a byproduct into a valuable source of
   nutrients for the production of microalgae biomass. This study involves
   the production of microalgae in open cultivation, using domestic
   effluents as a source of nutrients in brackish environments, to study
   the potential for biodiesel production. Intracellular lipids were
   between 17 and 20%. As for the bioremediation capacity, the results
   showed removal levels greater than 95% of nutrients, as well as
   bacterial and pollutant load reduction. The growth kinetics and the
   prediction of theoretical kinetic models through the use of
   computational tools show significant differences, due to the lack of
   control of process parameters in open cultivations. Based on the
   literature review and market research, a cost analysis for large-scale
   production in open crops was made, comparing with closed crops and
   finding lower costs in the implementation, maintenance and production of
   biodiesel in the production open.

U1 3
U2 33
AB Biofuels from microalgae have promising potential for a sustainable
   bioeconomy. Algal strains' oil content and biomass yield are the most
   influential cost drivers in the fourth generation biofuel (FGB)
   production. Genetic modification is the key to improving oil
   accumulation and biomass yield, consequently developing the bioeconomy.
   This paper discusses current practices, new insights, and emerging
   trends in genetic modification and their bioeconomic impact on FGB
   production. It was demonstrated that enhancing the oil and biomass yield
   could significantly improve the probability of economic success and the
   net present value of the FGB production process. The techno-economic and
   socioeconomic burden of using genetically modified (GM) strains and the
   preventive control strategies on the bioeconomy of FGB production is
   reviewed. It is shown that the fully lined open raceway pond could cost
   up to 25% more than unlined ponds. The cost of a plastic hoop
   air-supported greenhouse covering cultivation ponds is estimated to be
   US 60,000$ /ha. The competitiveness and profitability of large-scale
   cultivation of GM biomass are significantly locked to techno-economic
   and socioeconomic drivers. Nonetheless, it necessitates further research
   and careful long-term follow-up studies to understand the mechanism that
   affects these parameters the most.

AB This study assessed bioremediation of acid rock drainage in simulated
   permeable reactive barriers (PRB) using algae, Chlorella sorokiniana, as
   the sole electron donor for sulfate-reducing bacteria. Lipid extracted
   algae (LEA), the residues of biodiesel production, were compared with
   whole cell algae (WCA) as an electron donor to promote sulfate-reducing
   activity. Inoculated columns containing anaerobic granular sludge were
   fed a synthetic medium containing H2SO4 and Cu2+. Sulfate, sulfide, Cu2+
   and pH were monitored throughout the experiment of 123 d. Cu recovered
   in the column packing at the end of the experiment was evaluated using
   sequential extraction. Both WCA and LEA promoted 80% of sulfate removal
   (12.7 mg SO42- d-1) enabling near complete Cu removal (>99.5%) and
   alkalinity generation raising the effluent pH to 6.5. No noteworthy
   sulfate reduction, alkalinity formation and Cu2+ removal were observed
   in the endogenous control. In algae amended-columns, Cu2+ was
   precipitated with biogenic H2S produced by sulfate reduction. Formation
   of CuS was evidenced by sequential extraction and X-ray diffraction. LEA
   and WCA provided similar levels of electron donor based on the COD
   balance. The results demonstrate an innovative passive remediation
   system using residual algae biomass from the biodiesel industry.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) are innovative, high-throughput materials that have
   revolutionized nearly every area of human life. Microalgae represent a
   highly favourable eco-conscious choice in the pursuit of biofuel
   production. The synthesis of biofuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol,
   bio-hydrogen, bio-methane, and syngas can utilize microalgal biomass as
   a feedstock. Microalgae cannot currently be used to produce large-scale
   biofuels due to a lack of economic viability. The addition of NPs to
   microalgal cultures can boost light conversion in the microalgae
   photobioreactor and increase CO2 absorption yield. This study provides
   an in-depth review of the current trends and prospects of NPs applied to
   microalgae. It delves into how NPs can influence the metabolic pathways
   of microalgae and examines potential morphological toxicity. The
   research conducted in this area has revealed that the toxicity of NPs is
   influenced by various factors, including their nature (size, oxidation
   state, crystal structure), concentration, the composition of the
   cultivation media, and the specific microalgae species being used. This
   study suggested that the mechanism of nanoparticle internalization with
   microalgae via endocytosis, ion release (absorption through an ionic
   channel), shading influence, adsorption, and absorption by the pore
   route are all mechanisms by which NPs interact with microalgae.
   Moreover, the addition of NPs has demonstrated a significant positive
   impact on intracellular compound accumulation and overall growth.

AB Current momentum of microalgal research rests extensively in tapping the
   potential of multi-omics methodologies in regard to sustainable
   biofuels. Microalgal biomass is fermented to bioethanol; while lipids,
   particularly triacylglycerides (TAGs), are transesterified to
   biodiesels. Biodiesel has emerged as an ideal biofuel candidate; hence,
   its commercialization and use are increasingly being emphasized. Abiotic
   stresses exaggerate TAG accumulation, but the precise mechanisms are yet
   to be known. More recently, comprehensive multi-omics studies in
   microalgae have emerged from the biofuel perspective. Genomics and
   transcriptomics of microalgae have provided crucial leads and basic
   understanding toward lipid biosynthesis. Proteomics and metabolomics are
   now complementing "algal omics" and offer precise functional insights
   into the attendant static and dynamic physiological contexts. Indeed,
   the field has progressed from shotgun to targeted approaches. Notably,
   targeted proteomics studies in microalga are not yet reported. Several
   multi-omics tools and technologies that may be used to dig deeper into
   the microalgal physiology are examined and highlighted in this review.
   The article therefore aims to both introduce various available
   high-throughput biotechnologies and applications of "omics" in
   microalgae, and enlists a compendium of the emerging cutting edge
   literature. We suggest that a strategic and thoughtful combination of
   data streams from different omics platforms can provide a system-wide
   overview. The algal omics warrants closer attention in the future, with
   a view to technical, economic, and societal impacts that are anticipated
   in the current postgenomics era.

AB We developed a new dynamic model to characterize how light and nitrogen
   regulate the cellular processes of photosynthetic microalgae leading to
   transient changes in the production of neutral lipids, carbohydrates,
   and biomass. Our model recapitulated the versatile neutral lipid
   synthesis pathways via (i) carbon reuse from carbohydrate metabolism
   under nitrogen sufficiency and (ii) fixed carbon redirection under
   nitrogen depletion. We also characterized the effects of light
   adaptation, light inhibition hysteresis, and nitrogen limitation on
   photosynthetic carbon fixation. The formulated model was calibrated and
   validated with experimental data of Dunaliella viridis cultivated in a
   lab-scale photobioreactor (PBR) under various light (low/moderate/high)
   and nitrogen (sufficient/limited) conditions. We conducted the
   identifiability, uncertainty, and sensitivity analyses to verify the
   model reliability using the profile likelihood method, the Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, and the extended Fourier Amplitude
   Sensitivity Test (eFAST). Our model predictions agreed well with
   experimental observations and suggested potential model improvement by
   incorporating a lipid degradation mechanism. The insights from our
   model-driven analysis helped improve the mechanistic understanding of
   transient algae growth and bioproducts formation under environmental
   variations and could be applied to optimize biofuel and biomass
   production.

AB Azolla species are the world's smallest but most commercially
   significant, macrophytes, which float on the water surface and are found
   in freshwater and brackish waters. Azolla is one of the fastest growing
   plants on the globe, and it can double its surface area every 5 to 10
   days, making it an extremely valuable resource. Anabaena azollae, a
   cyanobacteria, which is harboured in the leaf lobe of Azolla, is capable
   of fixing atmospheric nitrogen while making it accessible to crop
   plants. Therefore, the Azolla-Anabaena relationship is significant in
   agronomy. The presence of a symbiotic cyanobacterium, A. azollae, which
   occupies the dorsal lobe of the leaves, contributes to the system's
   nitrogen-fixing capabilities. As a result of this characteristic, it has
   been widely used as a biofertilizer for rice plants. Apart from that, it
   may be used for a variety of other things, such as food and feed,
   biofuel production, and heavy metal accumulation. Because it has so many
   uses, promoting and using the Azolla-Anabaena system in sustainable
   agriculture would be helpful and good for the environment.

AB Algal biofuels are a growing interest worldwide due to their potential
   in terms of sustainable greenhouse gas displacement and energy
   production. This article describes a comparative survey of biodiesel
   production and conversion yields of biodiesel via alkaline
   transesterification of acylglycerols extracted from the
   microalgaeThalassiosira pseudonanaandPhaeodactylum tricornutum, grown
   under silicate or nitrate limitation, and that of model vegetable oils:
   soybean, and rapeseed oil. Acylglycerols were extracted withn-hexane and
   the total yield per biomass was determined by gravimetric assay. Under
   our conditions, the total acylglycerol yield from the microalgae studied
   was 13-18% of total dry weight. The biodiesel samples were analyzed
   using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector to determine
   quantitative information of residual glycerol, mono-, di-, and
   tri-acylglycerol concentrations in the biodiesel. All of the algal-based
   biodiesel demonstrated less mono-, di-, and tri-acylglycerol
   concentrations than the vegetable-based biodiesel under identical
   transesterification conditions. The fatty acid compositions of all the
   feedstock oils and their resultant biodiesel were also analyzed and
   reported. Based on the fatty acid methyl ester compositions of our
   samples we qualitatively assessed the suitability of the algal-derived
   biodiesel in terms of cetane number (CN), cold-flow properties, and
   oxidative stability.

AB Chlorella vulgarisproteins show high potential for food applications.
   The challenge of biorefinery is to choose the best processes coupling
   which can ensure the integrity of the molecules and limit energy
   consumption. This study aimed at understanding the impact of biomass
   concentration and physicochemical conditions during cell disruption, on
   the whole process (bead milling (BM), centrifugation, microfiltration).
   The best scenario tested (BM: 60 g/LDW, 10°C, lysate dilution: 30 g/LDW,
   pH 7, 20°C before centrifugation and filtration of the supernatant at a
   volume reduction ratio VRR = 3) allowed a soluble protein recovery etaS=
   12% with a limited energy consumption of 10 kW h/g protein. Coupling BM
   at 90 g/LDW, pH 7, a dilution at 20°C, with NaCl 0.1 M at 30 g/LDWand
   filtration at VRR = 20 would lead to etaS>25%. The final soluble
   proteins contained no green pigment; their purity increased from 5% in
   the raw biomass to 22% in the permeate.

AB Although the research of microalgae pyrolysis has been conducted for
   many years, there is a lack of investigations on energy efficiency and
   life cycle assessment. In this study, we investigated the biocrude yield
   and energy efficiency of direct pyrolysis, microalgae residue pyrolysis
   after lipid extraction (indirect pyrolysis), and different microalgae
   co-pyrolysis. This research also investigated the life cycle assessment
   of the three different pyrolysis pathways. A system boundary of
   Well-to-Wake (WTWa) was defined and included sub-process models, such as
   feedstock production, fuel production and pump-to-wheels (PTW) stages.
   The pathway of Isochrysis indirect pyrolysis shows the best performance
   in the mass ratio and energy ratio, produces the most kerosene component
   precursor, has the lowest WTWa total energy input, fossil fuel
   consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and results in the best energy
   efficiency. All the evidence indicates that Isochrysis R2 pathway is a
   potential and optimal pyrolysis pathway to liquid biofuels. The mass
   ratio of pyrolysis biocrude is shown to be the decisive factor for
   different microalgae species. The sensitivity analysis results also
   indicates that the life cycle indicators are particularly sensitive to
   the mass ratio of pyrolysis biocrude for microalgae-based hydrotreated
   pyrolysis aviation fuel.

SO Biomass and Bioenergy
VL 187
PY 2024
U1 17
U2 38
AB The rising worldwide need for energy, driven by industrial expansion,
   population increase, and transportation demands, poses a substantial
   issue. Microalgae are extremely promising raw materials for biofuel
   production, and pyrolysis is an efficient method of turning biomass into
   bioenergy. However, biofuels generated from microalgae pyrolysis
   frequently have inferior fuel characteristics due to high quantities of
   moisture and nitrogen. At the same time, population growth has resulted
   in a large increase in plastic trash, causing serious environmental
   issues. While some plastics are recycled, a large portion stays useless,
   adding to environmental issues. The present research looks at how to
   overcome these issues by investigating the co-pyrolysis of waste
   plastics and microalgae biomass. This technique provides synergistic
   benefits for both fuel and value-added product manufacturing. The
   resultant materials can be utilized as chemicals and to absorb
   pollutants, providing ecologically acceptable waste management solutions
   and supporting sustainability. Co-pyrolysis inhibits the transformation
   of oxygen and nitrogen to bio-oil in a highly efficient method,
   increasing oxygen release as H2O and nitrogen conversion to gas
   products. The paper fully examines the physicochemical features of
   microalgae biomass and waste plastics, offering a thorough overview. It
   also summarizes the present research state of microalgae biomass and
   plastic co-pyrolysis technology, highlighting the synergistic impacts
   and identifying future development opportunities. The review's last part
   addresses the economic feasibility, critical challenges, and the
   potential of co-pyrolysis processes, offering light on this method of
   waste disposal and sustainable energy generation.

VL 25

PY 2024
U1 4
U2 8
AB The commercialization of algal lipids and biofuels remains impractical
   due to the absence of lipogenic strains. As lipogenesis is regulated by
   a multitude of factors, the success in producing industrially suitable
   algal strains through conventional methods has been constrained. We
   present a new AP2 transcription factor, designated as NgAP2a, which,
   upon overexpression, leads to a significant increase in lipid storage in
   Nannochloropsis gaditana while maintaining the integrity of other
   physiological functions. These provide methodologies for enhancing
   petroleum output and optimizing the carbon fluxes associated with
   specific products. An integrated analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
   and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data has
   elucidated that the NgAP2a-induced up-regulation of critical genes is
   implicated in lipogenesis. Specifically, NgAP2a has been demonstrated to
   directly bind to the M1 motif situated within the promoter region of the
   KCS gene, thereby promoting the transcriptional activation of genes
   pertinent to lipid metabolism. In summary, we elucidate a plausible
   pathway whereby NgAP2a serves as a direct modulator of the KCS gene
   (Naga_100083g23), thereby influencing the expression levels of genes and
   molecules associated with lipid biosynthesis.

AB Microalgae can add value to biological wastewater treatment processes by
   capturing carbon and nutrients and producing valuable biomass.
   Harvesting small cells from liquid media is a challenge easily addressed
   with biofilm cultivation. Three experimental photobioreactors were
   constructed from inexpensive materials (e.g. plexiglass, silicone) for
   hybrid liquid/biofilm cultivation of a microalgal-bacterial consortia in
   aquaculture effluent. Three light regimes (full-spectrum, blue-white,
   and red) were implemented to test light spectra as a process control.
   High-intensity full-spectrum light caused photoinhibition and low
   biomass yield, but produced the most polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) (0.14 mg
   g-1); a renewable bioplastic polymer. Medium-intensity blue-white light
   was less effective for carbon capture, but removed up to 82% of
   phosphorus. Low-intensity red light was the only net carbon-negative
   regime, but increased phosphorus (+4.98 mg/L) in the culture medium.
   Light spectra and intensity have potential as easily-implemented process
   controls for targeted wastewater treatment, biomass production, and PHB
   synthesis using photosynthetic consortia.

AB Excess consumption of energy by humans is compounded by environmental
   pollution, the greenhouse effect and climate change impacts. Current
   developments in the use of algae for bioenergy production offer several
   advantages. Algal biomass is hence considered a new bio-material which
   holds the promise to fulfil the rising demand for energy. Microalgae are
   used in effluents treatment, bioenergy production, high value added
   products synthesis and CO2 capture. This review summarizes the potential
   applications of algae in bioelectrochemically mediated oxidation
   reactions in fully biotic microbial fuel cells for power generation and
   removal of unwanted nutrients. In addition, this review highlights the
   recent developments directed towards developing different types of
   microalgae MFCs. The different process factors affecting the performance
   of microalgae MFC system and some technological bottlenecks are also
   addressed.

AB Economically viable microalgal biodiesel production is unrealistic and
   unsustainable owing to expensive harvesting or dewatering techniques.
   Hence, immense and meticulous exploration of harvesting process is
   essential to identify knowledge leads by which suitable harvesting
   technique could be ascertained for lucrative biodiesel production. With
   this in view, this review aims to collate and highlight the spectrum of
   harvesting techniques applied to microalgae, i.e., conventional-modern,
   high cost-inexpensiveness, energy efficient-energy consuming process. At
   the outset, global energy outlook and demand had been critically
   addressed, and the scientific ways to tackle or satiate the fuel demand
   had also been highlighted in this review. This review manuscript has
   thrown widespread light on the physical harvesting methods namely
   centrifugation, sedimentation, filtration, flotation and technical
   advantages thereof. Due to the energy-intensive and cost barrier of
   physical harvesting techniques, chemical methods entailing organic,
   inorganic, and electroflocculation have come to limelight and in this
   regard, microalgae used, floc recovery and the dose of flocculants have
   been compared and presented in detail. Further, state of the art
   harvesting techniques viz., bioflocculation by microalgae/bacteria,
   flocculation by pH adjustment, and magnetic nanocomposite based
   microalgal harvesting had been critically articulated. Besides
   discussing the several methods, this paper has summarized the key
   challenges in conventional and advanced harvesting techniques and also
   provided the scope thereof. Hence, the key suggestions and findings
   given in this manuscript would positively offer a well-defined roadmap
   in choosing foreseeable harvesting technology for cost-effective
   microalgal biofuel development.

AB Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms widely used in
   biotechnology, photosynthesis and abiotic stress research. There are
   several cyanobacterial strains modified to produce biofuels, but the
   influence of alcohols on cyanobacterial cell physiology is poorly
   understood. Here, we conducted a systematic study of the effects of nine
   primary aliphatic alcohols and an aromatic benzyl alcohol on both
   membrane physical state and the expression of genes for fatty acid
   desaturases (FADs) in a model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain
   PCC 6803. Hexan-1-ol was found to have the most membrane fluidizing
   action among all alcohols studied, with its efficiency correlating with
   both duration of treatment and alcohol concentration. A prolonged
   exposure to alcohol results in a continuous loss of unsaturated fatty
   acids (FAs) followed by cell death, an undesired challenge that should
   be considered in cyanobacterial biotechnology. We suggest that membrane
   fluidization is the key component in alcohol stress causing inactivation
   of FADs and resulting in a lethal depletion of unsaturated FAs. Due to
   the most pronounced effects of alcohol- and heat-induced membrane
   fluidization on desB encoding a terminal omega3-FAD, we propose to call
   desB a 'viscosity gene' in analogy to heat-induced 'fluidity gene' hspA.

AB In order to realize the potential of microalgal biodiesel there is a
   need for substantial impetus involving interventions to radically
   improve lipid yields upstream. Nutrient stress and alteration to
   cultivation conditions are commonly used lipid enhancement strategies in
   microalgae. The main bottleneck of applying conventional strategies is
   their scalability as some of these strategies incur additional cost and
   energy. Novel lipid enhancement strategies have emerged to research
   forefront to overcome these challenges. In this review, the latest
   trends in microalgal lipid enhancement strategies, possible solutions
   and future directions are critically discussed. Advanced strategies such
   as combined nutrient and cultivation condition stress,
   microalgae-bacteria interactions, use of phytohormones EDTA and chemical
   additives, improving light conditions using LED, dyes and paints, and
   gene expression analysis are described. Molecular approaches such as
   metabolic and genetic engineering are emerging as the potential lipid
   enhancing strategies. Recent advancements in gene expression studies,
   genetic and metabolic engineering have shown promising results in
   enhancing lipid productivity in microalgae; however environmental risk
   and long term viability are still major challenges.

AB Microalgae are a potential candidate for biofuel production and
   environmental treatment because of their specific characteristics (e.g.
   fast growth, carbon neutral, and rich lipid accumulations). However,
   several primary bottlenecks still exist in current technologies,
   including low biomass conversion efficiency, bio-invasion from the
   external environment, limited or costly nutrient sources, and high
   energy and capital input for harvest, and stalling its industrial
   progression. Coupling biofuel production with environmental treatment
   renders microalgae a more feasible feedstock. This review focuses on
   microalgae biotechnologies for both bioenergy generation and
   environmental treatment (e.g. CO2sequestration and wastewater
   reclamation). Different intelligent technologies have been developed,
   especially during the last decade, to eliminate the bottlenecks,
   including mixotrophic/heterotrophic cultivation, immobilization, and
   co-cultivation. It has been realized that any single purpose for the
   cultivation of microalgae is not an economically feasible option.
   Combinations of applications in biorefineries are gradually reckoned to
   be necessary as it provides more economically feasible and
   environmentally sustainable operations. This presents microalgae as a
   special niche occupier linking the fields of energy and environmental
   sciences and technologies. The integrated application of microalgae is
   also proven by most of the life-cycle analysis studies. This study
   summarizes the latest development of primary microalgal biotechnologies
   in the two areas that will bring researchers a comprehensive view
   towards industrialization with an economic perspective.

AB Microalgae based treatment was studied to polish sequential batch
   reactor (SBR) treated pharmaceutical wastewater under mixotrophic mode
   of operation with simultaneous biomass/lipid production. At the end of
   biomass growth phase (BGP), carbon removal efficiency was observed to be
   73% along with good removal of nitrates (62%). Since microalgae
   assimilate nutrients from wastewater for growth, an increment in total
   biomass productivity (2.8 g/l) was observed. Subjecting to nutrient
   stress phase (NSP), total lipid content of 17.2% with neutral lipids of
   6.2% was observed under light condition. Contrarily, dark condition
   depicted total lipid content of 15.8% with neutral lipids constituting
   6.5%. The nutrient stress in combination with light showed marked
   influence on the profile of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.
   Integration of microalgae cultivation improves environmental
   sustainability and enables greener routes of biofuels and value added
   products synthesis in a biorefinery approach.

AB Cyanobacteria are blue-green Gram-negative and photosynthetic bacteria
   which are seen as one of the most morphologically numerous groups of
   prokaryotes. Because of their ability to fix gaseous nitrogen and carbon
   dioxide to organic materials, they are known to play important roles in
   the universal nutrient cycle. Cyanobacteria has emerged as one of the
   promising resources to combat the issues of global warming, disease
   outbreaks, nutrition insecurity, energy crises as well as persistent
   daily human population increases. Cyanobacteria possess significant
   levels of macro and micronutrient substances which facilitate the
   versatile popularity to be utilized as human food and protein
   supplements in many countries such as Asia. Cyanobacteria has been
   employed as a complementary dietary constituent of feed for poultry and
   as vitamin and protein supplement in aquatic lives. They are effectively
   used to deal with numerous tasks in various fields of biotechnology,
   such as agricultural (including aquaculture), industrial (food and dairy
   products), environmental (pollution control), biofuel (bioenergy) and
   pharmaceutical biotechnology (such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory,
   immunosuppressant, anticoagulant and antitumor); recently, the growing
   interest of applying them as biocatalysts has been observed as well.
   Cyanobacteria are known to generate a numerous variety of bioactive
   compounds. However, the versatile potential applications of
   cyanobacteria in biotechnology could be their significant growth rate
   and survival in severe environmental conditions due to their distinct
   and unique metabolic pathways as well as active defensive mechanisms. In
   this review, we elaborated on the versatile cyanobacteria applications
   in different areas of biotechnology. We also emphasized the factors that
   could impede the implementation to cyanobacteria applications in
   biotechnology and the execution of strategies to enhance their effective
   applications.

AB Microalgal biohydrogen (bioH2) has attracted global interest owing to
   its potential carbon-free source of sustainable renewable energy. Most
   of previous reviews which focused on microalgal bioH2, have shown
   unclear differentiation among the metabolic pathways. In this review,
   investigation of all different metabolic pathways for microalgal bioH2
   production along with discussion on the recent research work of last
   5-years have been considered. The major factors (such as light, vital
   nutrients, microalgal cell density, and substrate bioavailability) are
   highlighted. Moreover, effect of various pretreatment approaches on the
   constituent's bioaccessibility is reported. Microbial electrolysis cells
   as a new strategy for bioH2 production is stated. Comparison between the
   operation conditions of various bioreactors and economic feasibility is
   also emphasized. Genetic, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology
   as recent technologies improved the microalgal bioH2 production through
   inactivation of uptake hydrogenase (H2ase), inhibition of the competing
   pathways in polysaccharide synthesis, and improving the O2 tolerant
   H2ase.

AB National industrial effluent remediation strategies are largely
   outdated, which makes these processes costly and at the same time
   inefficient. Among the most worrying compounds are heavy metals, which
   have bioaccumulative and toxic characteristics to living beings. In
   addition to these, high nutrient loads constitute a huge environmental
   problem, since the devastation promoted by eutrophic niches is capable
   of disrupting complex food chains. This paper presents a bibliographical
   review of the current researches that are applying biomass from
   microalgae in effluent bioremediation, both domestic and industrial
   (mainly the latter, since its pollution potential is abruptly greater).
   Such strategy is interesting since the diversity of these microorganisms
   is abundant, propitiating the application of them in various conditions.
   Another point to be taken into consideration is the fact that many
   species of microalgae produce large amounts of lipids, many of which
   have potential application in the production of biodiesel.

AB The microalgae biomass is emerging as a potential source of energy and
   bioproducts with several advantages over conventional crops in terms of
   its ability to produce 300-times more renewable oil. Microalgae also
   have a high photosynthetic response, product accumulation rate and
   biomass production rate compared with other energy crops. Microalgae
   have the ability to grow on nonagricultural soil using wastewater
   instead of drinking water. Furthermore, microalgae have high capability
   to fix carbon dioxide from the environment. Microalgae-based bioproducts
   have different applications in pharmaceuticals, food and feed
   industries, and agricultural and transportation sectors. The key
   objectives covered in this review pertain to the role of microalgae to
   (i) maintain food chain, (ii) conservation of land and water resources
   in the environment with sequestration of CO2, (iii) production of energy
   in the form of biodiesel with zero waste, and (iv) simultaneous release
   of higher oxygen to the environment compared with other energy crops.

U1 1
U2 64
AB The interest in using microalgae to produce biodiesel is rapidly
   increasing in an effort to search for renewable and alternative energy.
   In an attempt to support algal biodiesel industry, the exploration of
   sustainability concerns involved in biodiesel refinery is becoming more
   and more necessary and important. From a sustainability perspective,
   this paper addresses the environmental, economic, social, and cultural
   implications of microalgae-based biodiesel refinery. From an
   environmental standpoint, there are four main related concerns: first,
   less water is required and water used can be recycled greatly, but it
   might cause water and even groundwater pollution; second, although
   low-value lands can be used for construction, it might cause land use
   changes and soil erosion; third, infrastructure construction and
   eutrophication by water pollution will threaten on local biodiversity;
   finally, there are some disputes of energy input and greenhouse gases
   emissions. From an economic point of view, the main benefit lies in an
   increase of employment and incomes, while the main drawback is the
   overwhelming investments required due to high costs. Socially, it can
   improve energy security and create jobs, while, on the other hand, it
   might affect the health of local animals and people. From a cultural
   viewpoint, algal biodiesel concept is a new element, and it requires
   time for people to adapt. With effective use of measures in technologies
   and policies, the microalgae-derived biodiesel industry will
   commercialize at levels of sustainability.

AB Chlorella vulgarisandScenedesmus obliquuswere grown in
   artificial-wastewater using a new nitrogen-limitation strategy aimed at
   increasing lipid productivity. This strategy consisted in a multi-stage
   process with sequential reduction of N-NH4concentration (from 90 to 60,
   40, and 20 mg.L-1) to promote a balance between cell growth and lipid
   accumulation. Lipid productivity was compared against a reference
   process consisting of nitrogen reduction in two stages, where the
   nitrogen concentration was suddenly reduced from 90 mg.L-1to three
   different concentrations (10, 20, and 30 mg.L-1). In the multi-stage
   mode, onlyC. vulgarisexhibited a net lipid-productivity increase. Lipid
   content ofS. obliquusdid not present a significant increase, thus
   decreasing lipid productivity. The highest lipid productivities were
   observed in the two-stage mode for bothS. obliquusandC. vulgaris(194.9
   and 133.5 mg.L-1.d-1, respectively), and these values are among the
   highest reported in the literature to date.

AB Biodiesel production using microalgae is attractive in a number of
   respects. Here a number of pros and cons to using microalgae for
   biofuels production are reviewed. Algal cultivation can be carried out
   using non-arable land and non-potable water with simple nutrient supply.
   In addition, algal biomass productivities are much higher than those of
   vascular plants and the extractable content of lipids that can be
   usefully converted to biodiesel, triacylglycerols (TAGs) can be much
   higher than that of the oil seeds now used for first generation
   biodiesel. On the other hand, practical, cost-effective production of
   biofuels from microalgae requires that a number of obstacles be
   overcome. These include the development of low-cost, effective growth
   systems, efficient and energy saving harvesting techniques, and methods
   for oil extraction and conversion that are environmentally benign and
   cost-effective. Promising recent advances in these areas are
   highlighted.

AB Renewable algae biomass, Scenedesmus obliquus, was used as substrate for
   generating electricity in two chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs). From
   polarization test, maximum power density with pretreated algal biomass
   was 102 mW.m-2 (951 mW.m-3) at current generation of 276 mA.m-2. The
   individual electrode potential as a function of current generation
   suggested that anodic oxidation process of algae substrate had
   limitation for high current generation in MFC. Total chemical oxygen
   demand (TCOD) reduction of 74% was obtained when initial TCOD
   concentration was 534 mg.L-1 for 150 h of operation. The main organic
   compounds of algae oriented biomass were lactate and acetate, which were
   mainly used for electricity generation. Other byproducts such as
   propionate and butyrate were formed at a negligible amount.
   Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis pinpointed the
   charge transfer resistance (112 Omega) of anode electrode, and the
   exchange current density of anode electrode was 1214 nA.cm-2.

AB An RND (resistance-nodulation-division)-type transporter having the
   capacity to export free fatty acids (FFAs) was identified in the
   cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC 7942 during
   characterization of a mutant strain engineered to produce FFAs. The
   basic strategy for construction of the FFA-producing mutant was a
   commonly used one, involving inactivation of the endogenous acyl-acyl
   carrier protein synthetase gene (aas) and introduction of a foreign
   thioesterase gene ('tesA), but a nitrate transport mutant NA3 was used
   as the parental strain to achieve slow, nitrate-limited growth in batch
   cultures. Also, a nitrogen-regulated promoter PnirA was used to drive
   'tesA to maximize thioesterase expression during the nitrate-limited
   growth. The resulting mutant (dAS2T) was, however, incapable of growth
   under the conditions of nitrate limitation, presumably due to toxicity
   associated with FFA overproduction. Incubation of the mutant culture
   under the non-permissive conditions allowed for isolation of a
   pseudorevertant (dAS2T-pr1) capable of growth on nitrate. Genome
   sequence and gene expression analyses of this strain suggested that
   expression of an RND-type efflux system had rescued growth on nitrate.
   Targeted inactivation of the RND-type transporter genes in the wild-type
   strain resulted in loss of tolerance to exogenously added FFAs including
   capric, lauric, myristic, oleic and linolenic acids. Overexpression of
   the genes in dAS2T, on the other hand, enhanced FFA excretion and cell
   growth in nitrate-containing medium, verifying that the genes encode an
   efflux pump for FFAs. These results demonstrate the importance of the
   efflux system in efficient FFA production using genetically engineered
   cyanobacteria.

AB The diversity of microalgae and bacteria allows them to form a
   complementary consortium for efficient wastewater treatment and nutrient
   recovery. This review highlights the potential of wastewater-derived
   microalgal biomass as a renewable feedstock for producing animal feed,
   biofertilisers, biofuel, and many valuable biochemicals. Data
   corroborated from this review shows that microalgae and bacteria can
   thrive in many environments. Microalgae are especially effective at
   utilising nutrients from the water as they grow. This review also
   consolidates the current understanding of microalgae characteristics and
   their interactions with bacteria in a consortium system. Recent studies
   on the performance of only microalgae and microalgae-bacteria wastewater
   treatment are compared and discussed to establish a research roadmap for
   practical implementation of the consortium systems for various
   wastewaters (domestic, industrial, agro-industrial, and landfill
   leachate wastewater). In comparison to the pure microalgae system, the
   consortium system has a higher removal efficiency of up to 15% and
   shorter treatment time. Additionally, this review addresses a variety of
   possibilities for biomass application after wastewater treatment.

   fluorescence can be used to measure differences in biomass between
   populations of picoliter microdroplets containing different species of
   cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC 6803 and Synechococcus PCC 7002, which
   exhibit different growth dynamics in bulk culture. The potential and
   robustness of this label-free screening approach is further demonstrated
   by the screening and sorting of cells of the green alga Chlamydomonas
   reinhardtii encapsulated in droplets.

AB The green alga Chlorella protothecoides has received considerable
   attention because it accumulates neutral triacylglycerols, commonly
   regarded as an ideal feedstock for biodiesel production. In order to
   gain a better understanding of its metabolism, tracer experiments with
   [U-13C]/[1-13C]glucose were performed with heterotrophic growth of C.
   protothecoides for identifying the metabolic network topology and
   estimating intracellular fluxes. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   analysis tracked the labeling patterns of protein-bound amino acids,
   revealing a metabolic network consisting of the glycolysis, the pentose
   phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle with inactive
   glyoxylate shunt. Evidence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase,
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and malic enzyme activity was also
   obtained. It was demonstrated that the relative activity of the pentose
   phosphate pathway to glycolysis under nitrogen-limited environment
   increased, reflecting excess NADPH requirements for lipid biosynthesis.
   Although the growth rate and cellular oil content were significantly
   altered in response to nitrogen limitation, global flux distribution of
   C. protothecoides remained stable, exhibiting the rigidity of central
   carbon metabolism. In conclusion, quantitative knowledge on the
   metabolic flux distribution of oleaginous alga obtained in this study
   may be of value in designing strategies for metabolic engineering of
   desirable bioproducts.

AB One of the principal challenges for large scale production of microalgae
   is the high costs of biomass production. Aiming for minimize this
   problem, microalgal biodiesel production should focus on outdoors
   cultures, using available solar light and allowing lower energy cost
   process. Testing species that proved to be common and easy to culture
   may be a good approach in this process. The present work reports
   indoor-outdoor cultures of Phaeodactylum tricornutum using different
   bioreactors types, using cell growth, biochemical composition, and the
   profiles of the fatty acids produced as the parameters to test the
   optimization processes. The results show that the use of outdoor
   cultures is a good choice to obtain P. tricornutum biomass with a good
   potential for biodiesel production. The microalgae produced reached
   better growth efficiency, major lipid content and showed an increment in
   the percentage of saturated fatty acids (required on the biodiesel
   production) respect indoor cultures. These results are important to show
   the relevance of using outdoor cultures as a way to improve the
   efficiency and the energetic balance of the biodiesel production with P.
   tricornutum algae.

AB Cellulose and sugar from microalgae can be utilized for the production
   of biofuel ethanol. Increasing cellulose and sugar synthesis capacity is
   key for high yield production of this biofuel. To enhance cellulose
   production, we transferred acsAB, responsible for cellulose synthesis in
   bacterium Acetobacter xylinum, into the cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp.
   strain PCC7120, by conjugation. PCR confirmed the presence of acsAB in
   Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 exconjugates. RT-PCR demonstrated the
   up-regulation of acsAB expression. Production of extracellular cellulose
   secreted from Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 carrying acsAB was revealed
   using Calcofluor white staining and cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI)-FITC
   labeling. Further evidence obtained from the digestion of cellulose to
   glucose demonstrated that the amount of glucose released from cellulose
   was significantly increased in Anabaena sp. PCC7120 cells carrying acsAB
   as compared to the wild type. The photosynthetic efficiency and growth
   rate were increased in the transgenic strains. Cellulose synthesis is
   thus enhanced in Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 expressing acsAB and does
   not negatively impact photosynthesis and growth.

AB Microalgae have promising potential to produce lipids and a variety of
   high-value chemicals. Suitable stress conditions such as nitrogen
   starvation and high salinity could stimulate synthesis and accumulation
   of lipids and high-value products by microalgae, therefore, various
   stress-modification strategies were developed to manipulate and optimize
   cultivation processes to enhance bioproduction efficiency. On the other
   hand, advancements in omics-based technologies have boosted the research
   to globally understand microalgal gene regulation under stress
   conditions, which enable further improvement of production efficiency
   via genetic engineering. Moreover, integration of multi-omics data,
   synthetic biology design, and genetic engineering manipulations exhibits
   a tremendous potential in the betterment of microalgal biorefinery. This
   review discusses the process manipulation strategies and omics studies
   on understanding the regulation of metabolite biosynthesis under various

VL 289
PY 2021
U1 2
U2 21
AB An insecure energy supply has promoted the search of alternative
   energies. Anaerobic digestion can produce methane from energy
   crops.Opuntia ficus-indicaor cactus pear can produce high amounts of dry
   matter (DM), 10 Mg ha-1y-1with an average rainfall of 400 mm y-1. It is
   a crop with a high efficiency in the use of water (4.6 mg DM g-1H2O) and
   can grow on land not currently used for the production of other crops.
   This review found that Opuntia productivity strongly depends on
   agronomic management (50 Mg ha-1y-1). The increase in DM is reflected in
   an increase in the theoretical yield of biogas and methane. Opuntia
   cladodes have a high potential for producing methane (327 m3CH4Mg-1VS)
   because their carbohydrates have a low fiber content and are easily
   degraded. To optimize the production and quality of the biogas produced
   from Opuntia, its cladodes would have to be mixed with other raw
   materials (e.g. manure, plant residues, microalgae) and C/N ratio
   (16-30) for microorganisms in the digestate; the pH would also have to
   be modified to a neutral-alkaline range (the cladodes have a pH between
   3.5 and 5.5) for the same reason. The resulting digestate could be
   applied to the soil as a biofertilizer, improving its properties as well
   as crop productivity. This is important, above all, in soils in
   semi-arid zones. Finally, there are several challenges to validate
   Opuntia as an energy crop, especially from a holistic viewpoint that
   considers economic, social and environmental aspects.

AB Biofuels productions from microalgae received wide attention recently
   and have high potential to replace fossil fuels. This paper served as a
   platform to critically review current production technologies of
   microalgae, ranging from cultivation, harvesting, extraction and several
   biofuels conversion processes. In addition, due to the high
   photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae, mass cultivation of microalgae
   is believed to be able to efficiently reduce the carbon dioxide emission
   to atmosphere and thus, reducing the impact of global warming. This is
   because microalgae have high growth rate and is able to develop maximum
   of 70% of lipid content within their cells depending on species. Apart
   from that, microalgae have the ability to survive under harsh condition
   and occupied smaller cultivation land area than other land crops. The
   harvested microalgae biomass can be used for electrical generation,
   while its crude lipid can be used as transportation fuel as it has 80%
   average energy content of petroleum. In the present paper, a detailed
   discussion to produce biodiesel, fuel gas, bio-oil, methane, hydrogen
   and alcohol from microalgae biomass are also included. Besides, updated
   research, challenges and the way forward of microalgae biofuels are also
   presented. In future, biofuels production from microalgae can be
   economical viable at some scale, which is then profitable in terms of
   economics and also environment.

AB Microalgae are considered as excellent platforms for biomaterial
   production that can replace conventional fossil fuel-based fuels and
   chemicals. Genetic engineering of microalgae is prerequisite to maximize
   production of materials and to reduce costs for the production.
   Transcription factors (TFs) are emerging as key regulators of metabolic
   pathways to enhance production of molecules for biofuels and other
   materials. TFs with the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain have been
   known as stress regulators and are associated with lipid metabolism in
   plants. We overexpressed a bZIP TF, NsbZIP1, in Nannochloropsis salina,
   and found that transformants showed enhanced growth with concomitant
   increase in lipid contents. The improved phenotypes were also notable
   under stress conditions including N limitation and high salt. To
   understand the mechanism underlying improved phenotypes, we analyzed
   expression patterns of predicted target genes involved in lipid
   metabolism via quantitative RT-PCR, confirming increases transcript
   levels. NsbZIP1 appeared to be one of type C bZIPs in plants that has
   been known to regulate lipid metabolism under stress. Taken together, we
   demonstrated that NsbZIP1 could improve both growth and lipid
   production, and TF engineering can serve as an excellent genetic
   engineering tool for production of biofuels and biomaterials in
   microalgae.

VL 375
PY 2025
U1 30
U2 30
AB Effective treatment and sustainable waste sludge management are critical
   challenges for future biorefinery wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
   This study investigated the feasibility of re-granulating anaerobically
   digested bacterial and algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludge (AGS) for
   sustaining the continuous operation of the AGS-based WWTPs due to the
   requirement of long-term operation for granulation of flocculent
   activated sludge. Rapid re-granulation was achieved within 12 and 6 days
   respectively from digested bacterial AGS and algal-bacterial AGS,
   demonstrating their high stability and settleability even after
   anaerobic digestion (AD). The re-granulated bacterial AGS system
   exhibited >90% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal, probably
   attributed to its greater microbial diversity and richness and elevated
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion. The re-granulated
   algal-bacterial AGS system featured enhanced functional adaptability. It
   showed a lower average effluent dissolved total carbon concentration
   (~100 mg/L) and high total inorganic nitrogen removal (>89%) in addition
   to > 56% maximum total phosphorus removal. Morphological observations
   revealed that some granules retained their compact structure and cores
   after AD, providing a niche for their re-granulation. Aromatic proteins
   and fulvic acid-like organics were the critical promoters for AGS
   regranulation. Notable shifts in microbial community structure,
   particularly the increase in abundance of photosynthetic bacteria such
   asErythromicrobium,Leptolyngbya, andRhodobacter, played an essential
   role in enhancing the overall performance of the re-granulated
   algal-bacterial AGS. By validating the system's effectiveness and
   exploring the factors governing re-granulation, this study proposes a
   viable strategy for advancing the sustainability of AGS-based WWTPs and
   promoting circular bioeconomy practices.

AB Over the last 200 years, the mass burning of fossil fuels has caused
   excessive carbon dioxide releasing into the atmosphere, resulting in the
   global warming. This environmental problem has aroused people's concern,
   and it is urgent to exploit a new kind of sustainable energy. Comparing
   with other green energy, researchers believe that microalgae can not
   only convert CO2 into organics through photosynthesis, and it doesn't
   occupy agricultural lands, which has a good development prospect. This
   review introduced the domestic and foreign research of microalgae
   starch, starch biosynthesis metabolism, the methods to improve starch
   accumulating, as well as at the molecular level knowing the metabolism
   pathway of starch synthesis and regulatory genes, in order to gain lots
   of starch to produce bioethanol, providing new energy to human.

AB The use of fossil fuels is increasingly questioned due to depleting
   natural energy assets and the buildup of greenhouse gases (GHGs).
   Biofuels are an efficient substitute to existing fossil fuel based
   energy sources as they can be utilized for transport with little
   modification to existing techniques. They thus offer the prospect of
   ecological sustainability and reduced GHGs emission. Microalgae are
   unicellular autotrophic organisms that can convert atmospheric CO2into
   lipids which, after esterification, can be utilized as an energy source.
   Moreover, other bio-metabolites such as bioethanol and bio-hydrogen
   produced by algal cells are also potentially exploitable energy sources.
   On large scales, microalgae are cultivated either in open pond systems
   or in closed photo bioreactors. In this paper we review the prospects of
   microalgae for the production of valuable lipid compounds and other
   byproduct that can be additionally used for biofuel production.

AB The world is currently facing global energy crises and escalating
   environmental pollution, which are caused by the extensive exploitation
   of conventional energy sources. The limited availability of conventional
   energy sources has opened the door to the search for alternative energy
   sources. In this regard, microalgae have emerged as a promising
   substitute for conventional energy sources due to their high
   photosynthetic rate, high carbohydrate and lipid content, efficient
   CO2fixation capacity, and ability to thrive in adverse environments. The
   research and development of microalgal-based biofuel as a clean and
   sustainable alternative energy source has been ongoing for many years,
   but it has not yet been widely adopted commercially. However, it is
   currently gaining greater attention due to the integrated biorefinery
   concept. This study provides an in-depth review of recent advances in
   microalgae cultivation techniques and explores methods for increasing
   lipid production by manipulating environmental factors. Furthermore, our
   discussions have covered high lipid content microalgal species,
   harvesting methods, biorefinery concepts, process optimizing software
   tools, and the accumulation of triglycerides in lipid droplets. The
   study additionally explores the influence of abiotic stresses on the
   response of biosynthetic genes involved in lipid synthesis and
   metabolism. In conclusion, algae-based biofuels offer a viable
   alternative to traditional fuels for meeting the growing demand for
   energy.

AB This work examined the energetic performance of a 6-month
   semi-continuous cultivation of Scenedesmus obliquus in an outdoor
   photobioreactor at mid-temperate latitude, without temperature control.
   By measuring the seasonal biomass production (mean 11.31, range
   1.39-23.67 g m-2 d-1), higher heating value (22.94 kJ g-1) and solar
   irradiance, the mean seasonally-averaged photosynthetic efficiency
   (2.18%) and gross energy productivity (0.27 MJ m-2 d-1) was calculated.
   When comparing the solar energy conversion efficiency to the energy
   investment for culture circulation, significant improvements in reactor
   energy input must be made to make the system viable. Using the data
   collected to model the energetic performance of a substitute
   photobioreactor design, we conclude that sustainable photobioreactor
   cultivation of microalgae in similar temperate climates requires a short
   light path and low power input, only reasonably obtained by flat-panel
   systems. However, temperature control was not necessary for effective
   long-term cultivation.

AB Pond-grown microalgae have been considered as feedstocks for production
   of biodiesel. Various natural habitats and man-made environments can be
   exploited to cultivate microalgae without utilizing arable land which is
   already decreasing due to urbanization and industrial development.
   Suitable temperature, solar illumination and availability of phosphorus
   and nitrogen-rich organic wastes result in algal blooms in stagnant
   water and river bank's associated pools in many regions including
   Pakistan. However, for practical application different land areas and
   effluents of varying natural and man-influenced environments are to be
   screened for promoting growth and fat-rich body composition of
   microalgal biomass. Lessons from well-established science of continuous
   culturing of bacteria can be applied for the open systems with
   provisions of semi-controlled physico-chemical conditions. In situ
   microalgal cultivation ponds may be declared mandatory for suitable
   industries and they can also be cultivated along the banks of rivers.
   Such efforts will lead to the production of biodiesel, environmental
   management of effluents and usage of the oil extracted/defatted algal
   biomass as animal feed supplement. The triad of biofuel production,
   bioremediation of suitable effluents and provision of animal feed/its

   prospects of microalgal cultivation in different localities of Pakistan
   are discussed with reference to profitable investments.

AB SynechococcusPCC 7002 is an interesting species in view of industrial
   production of carbohydrates. The cultivation performances of this
   species are strongly affected by the pH of the medium, which also
   influences the carbohydrate accumulation. In this work, different
   methods of pH control were analyzed, in order to obtain a higher
   production of bothSynechococcusbiomass and carbohydrates. To better
   understand the influence of pH on growth and carbohydrate productivity,
   manual and automatic pH regulation in CO2and bicarbonate system were
   applied. The pH value of 8.5 resulted the best to achieve both of these
   goals. From an industrial point of view, an alternative way to maintain
   the pH practically constant during the entire period of cultivation is
   the exploitation of the bicarbonate-CO2buffer system, with the double
   aim to maintain the pH in the viability range and also to provide the
   amount of carbon required by growth. In this condition, a high
   concentration of biomass (6 g L-1) and carbohydrate content (around 60%)
   were obtained, which are promising in view of a potential use for
   bioethanol production. The chemical equilibrium of C-N-P species was
   also evaluated by applying the ionic balance equations, and a relation
   between the sodium bicarbonate added in the medium and the equilibrium
   value of pH was discussed.

AB One of the important issues concerning anaerobic digestion of microalgal
   biomass is the influence of the pretreatment on methane production.
   Various techniques can be used to extract lipids from microalgae,
   including thermal, chemical or physical processes. The process of lipid
   extraction can be considered as a pretreatment. Given the economic and
   ecologic importance of the integration of anaerobic digestion in the
   microalgae biodiesel production process, this article aims to review the
   literature about this subject, and relates the influence of various
   forms of lipids extraction on the methane generation by anaerobic
   digestion of residual microalgae biomass. The oil extraction using
   chloroform as a solvent should not be performed if the residue is to be
   exploited for anaerobic digestion, due to the inhibiting character of
   this solvent on methanogenic activity. The lipid extracted microalgal
   biomass presents higher methane yield compared to the raw microalgal
   biomass with few exceptions. The thermochemical method is the most
   commonly used pretreatment for lipid extraction of microalgal biomass.
   Nevertheless, research using pretreatment methods that require less
   energy such as mechanical and biological should be stimulated. Thus, the
   energy balance may become more favorable with the use of residual
   microalgae biomass as an energy source.

AB Hydrogen as a clean energy that is conducive to energy and environmental
   sustainability, playing a significant role in the alleviation of global
   climate change and energy crisis. Biohydrogen generation from microalgae
   has been reported as a highly attractive approach that can produce a
   benign clean energy carrier to achieve carbon neutrality and bioenergy
   sustainability. Thus, this review explored the mechanism of biohydrogen
   production from microalgae containing direct biophotolysis, indirect
   biophotolysis, photo fermentation, and dark fermentation. In general,
   dark fermentation of microalgae for biohydrogen production is relatively
   better than photo fermentation, biophotolysis, and microbial
   electrolysis, because it is able to consecutively generate hydrogen and
   is not reliant on energy supplied by natural sunlight. Besides, this
   review summarized potential algal strains for hydrogen production
   focusing on green microalgae and cyanobacteria. Moreover, a thorough
   review process was conducted to present hydrogen-producing enzymes
   targeting biosynthesis and localization of enzymes in microalgae.
   Notably, the most powerful hydrogen-producing enzymes are
   [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases, which have an activity nearly 10-100 times better
   than [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases and 1000 times better than nitrogenases. In
   addition, this work highlighted the major factors affecting low energy
   conversion efficiency and oxygen sensitivity of hydrogen-producing
   enzymes. Noting that the most practical pathway of biohydrogen
   generation was sulfur-deprivation compared with phosphorus, nitrogen,
   and magnesium deficiency. Further discussions in this work summarized
   the recent advancement in biohydrogen production from microalgae such as
   genetic engineering, microalgae-bacteria consortium,
   electro-bio-hydrogenation, and nanomaterials for developing enzyme
   stability and hydrolytic efficiency. More importantly, this review
   provided a summary of current limitations and future perspectives on the
   sustainable production of biohydrogen from microalgae.

AB Microalgae are photoautotrophic organisms with high commercial
   potential. Extracts from microalgae are extensively used in crop
   cultivation, mainly because they possess growth-promoting properties,
   coupled with their enhancing impacts on the crop's ability to withstand
   abiotic stresses viz. extreme temperatures, drought, salinity, and
   mineral deficiency. The chemical composition of microalgae extract
   includes carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, micronutrients,
   macronutrients, and phytohormones (auxins, cytokinins, ethylene,
   abscisic acid, and gibberellins). This review aims to provide an update
   on the trending facts for a better understanding of growing microalgae,
   the production of biomass, the processing of microalgae extracts,
   summarizing bioactive compounds, and the chemical constituent of
   microalgae extracts. Furthermore, we review the supporting literature on
   the application of microalgae extracts as biostimulants and
   biofertilizers to enhance crop productivity and control abiotic stresses
   in crop cultivation.

AB Microalgae are a sustainable source for the production of biofuels and
   bioactive compounds. This review discusses significant research on
   innovative extraction techniques using dimethyl ether (DME) as a green
   subcritical fluid. DME, which is characterized by its low boiling point
   and safety as an organic solvent, exhibits remarkable properties that
   enable high extraction rates of various active compounds, including
   lipids and bioactive compounds, from high-water-content microalgae
   without the need for drying. In this review, the superiority of
   liquefied DME extraction technology for microalgae over conventional
   methods is discussed in detail. In addition, we elucidate the extraction
   mechanism of this technology and address its safety for human health and
   the environment. This review also covers aspects related to extraction
   equipment, various applications of different extraction processes, and
   the estimation and trend analysis of the Hansen solubility parameters.
   In addition, we anticipate a promising trajectory for the expansion of
   this technology for the extraction of various resources.

AB Microalgae have recently attracted considerable interest worldwide, due
   to their extensive application potential in the renewable energy,
   biopharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries. Microalgae are
   renewable, sustainable, and economical sources of biofuels, bioactive
   medicinal products, and food ingredients. Several microalgae species
   have been investigated for their potential as value-added products with
   remarkable pharmacological and biological qualities. As biofuels, they
   are a perfect substitute to liquid fossil fuels with respect to cost,
   renewability, and environmental concerns. Microalgae have a significant
   ability to convert atmospheric CO2to useful products such as
   carbohydrates, lipids, and other bioactive metabolites. Although
   microalgae are feasible sources for bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals in
   general, some limitations and challenges remain, which must be overcome
   to upgrade the technology from pilot-phase to industrial level. The most
   challenging and crucial issues are enhancing microalgae growth rate and
   product synthesis, dewatering algae culture for biomass production,
   pretreating biomass, and optimizing the fermentation process in case of
   algal bioethanol production. The present review describes the advantages
   of microalgae for the production of biofuels and various bioactive
   compounds and discusses culturing parameters.

   but have deleterious effect on the field. This article focuses on the
   role of Cyanobacteria with context to the field of crop production (13).
   Cyanobacteria aka blue green algae belongs to aprimordialdescent of
   photo-oxygenic bacteria. They also form symbiotic association capable to
   fix atmospheric Nitrogen into utilise form and make it available to the
   plants. Its extra ordinary development rate shows its use in the field
   of biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, bio energy. The
   exo-polysaccharide of Cyanobacteria balances soil ecology and they have
   the ability to compete with flora and fauna. Several Cyanobacteria have

U2 36
AB Microalgae have received widespread interest owing to their potential in
   biofuel production. However, economical microalgal biomass production is
   conditioned by enhancing the lipid accumulation without decreasing
   growth rate or by increasing both simultaneously. While extensive
   investigation has been performed on promoting the economic feasibility
   of microalgal-based biofuel production that aims to increase the
   productivity of microalgae species, only a handful of them deal with
   increasing lipid productivity (based on lipid contents and growth rate)
   in the feedstock production process. The purpose of this review is to
   provide an overview of the recent advances and novel approaches in
   promoting lipid productivity (depends on biomass and lipid contents) in
   feedstock production from strain selection to after-harvesting stages.
   The current study comprises two parts. In the first part, bilateral
   improving biomass/lipid production will be investigated in upstream
   measures, including strain selection, genetic engineering, and
   cultivation stages. In the second part, the enhancement of lipid
   productivity will be discussed in the downstream measure included in the
   harvesting and after-harvesting stages. An integrated approach involving
   the strategies for increasing lipid productivity in up- and down-stream
   measures can be a breakthrough approach that would promote the
   commercialization of market-driven microalgae-derived biofuel
   production.

AB Background: Nitrogen starvation and limitation are known to induce
   important physiological changes especially in lipid metabolism of
   microalgae (triglycerides, membrane lipids, beta-carotene, etc.).
   Although little information is available forDunaliella salina, it is a
   promising microalga for biofuel production and biotechnological
   applications due to its ability to accumulate lipid together with
   beta-carotene. Results: Batch and chemostat experiments with various
   degrees of nitrogen limitation, ranging from starvation to
   nitrogen-replete conditions, were carried out to study carbon storage
   dynamics (total carbon, lipids, and beta-carotene) in steady state
   cultures ofD. salina. A new protocol was developed in order to manage
   the very high beta-carotene concentrations and to more accurately
   separate and quantify beta-carotene and triglycerides by chromatography.
   Biomass evolution was appropriately described by the Droop model on the
   basis of the nitrogen quota dynamics. Conclusions: Triglycerides and
   beta-carotene were both strongly anti-correlated with nitrogen quota
   highlighting their carbon sink function in nitrogen depletion
   conditions. Moreover, these two valuable molecules were correlated each
   other for nitrogen replete conditions or moderated nitrogen limitations
   (N:C ratio higher than 0.04). Under nitrogen starvation, i.e., for very
   low N:C ratio, the dynamic revealed, for the first time, uncoupled part
   (higher triglyceride accumulation than beta-carotene), possibly because
   of shortage in key proteins involved in the stabilization of lipid
   droplets. This study motivates the accurate control of the microalgal
   nitrogen quota in order to optimize lipid productivity.

U1 3
U2 191
AB Biofuels derived from microalgae biomass have received a great deal of
   attention owing to their high potentials as sustainable alternatives to
   fossil fuels. Microalgae have a high capacity of CO2 fixation and
   depending on their growth conditions, they can accumulate different
   quantities of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Microalgal biomass
   can, therefore, represent a rich source of fermentable sugars for third
   generation bioethanol production. The utilization of microalgal
   carbohydrates for bioethanol production follows three main stages: (i)
   pretreatment, (ii) saccharification, and (iii) fermentation. One of the
   most important stages is the pretreatment, which is carried out to
   increase the accessibility to intracellular sugars, and thus plays an
   important role in improving the overall efficiency of the bioethanol
   production process. Diverse types of pretreatments are currently used
   including chemical, thermal, mechanical, biological, and their
   combinations, which can promote cell disruption, facilitate extraction,
   and result in the modification the structure of carbohydrates as well as
   the production of fermentable sugars. In this review, the different
   pretreatments used on microalgae biomass for bioethanol production are
   presented and discussed. Moreover, the methods used for starch and total
   carbohydrates quantification in microalgae biomass are also briefly
   presented and compared.

AB Microalgae could become an important resource for addressing increasing
   global demand for food, energy, and commodities while helping to reduce
   atmospheric greenhouse gasses. Even thoughChlorophytesare generally
   regarded safe for human consumption, there is still much we do not
   understand about the metabolic and biochemical potential of microscopic
   algae. The aim of this study was to evaluate biofuel candidate strains
   ofChlorellaandScenedesmusfor the potential to produce bioactive
   metabolites when grown under nutrient depletion regimes intended to
   stimulate production of triacylglycerides. Strain specific combinations
   of macro- and micro-nutrient restricted growth media did stimulate
   neutral lipid accumulation by microalgal cultures. However, cultures
   that were restricted for iron consistently and reliably tested positive
   for cytotoxicity byin vivobioassays. The addition of iron back to these
   cultures resulted in the disappearance of the bioactive components by
   LC/MS fingerprinting and loss of cytotoxicity byin vivobioassay.
   Incomplete NMR characterization of the most abundant cytotoxic fractions
   suggested that small molecular weight peptides and glycosides could be
   responsible forChlorellacytotoxicity. Experiments were conducted to
   determine if the bioactive metabolites induced by Fe-limitation
   inChlorellasp. cultures would elicit protection againstVampirovibrio
   chlorellavorus, an obligate predator ofChlorella. Introduction ofV.
   chlorellavorusresulted in a 72% decrease in algal biomass in the
   experimental controls after 7 days. Conversely, only slight losses of
   algal biomass were measured for the iron limitedChlorellacultures
   (0-9%). This study demonstrates a causal linkage between iron
   bioavailability and bioactive metabolite production in strains
   ofChlorellaandScenedesmus. Further study of this phenomenon could
   contribute to the development of new strategies to extend algal
   production cycles in open, outdoor systems while ensuring the protection
   of biomass from predatory losses.

AB The world energy crisis and increased greenhouse gas emissions have
   driven the search for alternative and environmentally friendly renewable
   energy sources. According to life cycle analysis, microalgae biofuel is
   identified as one of the major renewable energy sources for sustainable
   development, with potential to replace the fossil-based fuels.
   Microalgae biofuel was devoid of the major drawbacks associated with oil
   crops and lignocelluloses-based biofuels. Algae-based biofuels are
   technically and economically viable and cost competitive, require no
   additional lands, require minimal water use, and mitigate atmospheric
   CO2. However, commercial production of microalgae biodiesel is still not
   feasible due to the low biomass concentration and costly downstream
   processes. The viability of microalgae biodiesel production can be
   achieved by designing advanced photobioreactors, developing low cost
   technologies for biomass harvesting, drying, and oil extraction.
   Commercial production can also be accomplished by improving the genetic
   engineering strategies to control environmental stress conditions and by
   engineering metabolic pathways for high lipid production. In addition,
   new emerging technologies such as algal-bacterial interactions for
   enhancement of microalgae growth and lipid production are also explored.
   This review focuses mainly on the problems encountered in the commercial
   production of microalgae biofuels and the possible techniques to
   overcome these difficulties.

AB Combining microalgae cultivation with nutrient removal is a promising
   technique as it enables renewable energy generation with the additional
   potential removal of wastewater contaminants in a single process.
   Performance and total yield of this process are still below the standard
   for industrialization. Thus, optimization is needed to reach the
   feasibility and actualize the concept. Cultivation conditions and
   reactor design play essential roles in the application and feasibility
   of this process. Both aspects have been developed through the years to
   enable the industrial application of this concept. Cultivation
   conditions are usually categorized into trophic conditions in which each
   situation has its specific function and target of removal. These
   conditions, however, are also applied in various reactor systems. Closed
   photobioreactor and open pond are two central systems for the reactor.
   Two of the most applied reactor models in wastewater are reviewed here
   to create a broad picture of the algae cultivation process by
   emphasizing biomass production and considering different aspects.

AB Microalgae are promising sources of biofuels due to the high lipid
   content of some species. However, growing microalgae at large scales
   involves high production costs, mainly associated with nutrient inputs
   and harvesting processes. Therefore, to be cost competitive, species to
   be used as a source of fuels should be capable of accumulating lipids
   and biomass at lower fertilizer inputs. In the present study, we
   isolated and identified a native microalgal strain ofBotryococcussp.
   which was cultured under varying nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon dioxide
   regimes. The effects of nutrient availability on biomass, lipid
   production and fatty acid profiles were examined. We observed an
   increase in the relative lipid content from 25.5% under nitrogen
   non-limiting conditions to 41.8% under nitrogen deprivation. The lipid
   profile induced by nitrogen limitation was found to be dominated by
   saturated and monounsaturated lipid classes, meeting the European
   Standards for biodiesel and oil suitable for biofuel production. Thus,
   thisBotryococcussp. has the potential to be used at large scale cultures
   with the purpose of producing biofuels with lower fertilizer costs.

   Design/methodology/approach: The samples were collected in April 2018
   using a conical network by horizontal dragging for five minutes at 30 cm
   below the water surface. The samples were inoculated in test tubes in
   Guillard F/2 and BBM culture media to observe the presence of microalgae
   in optical microscope (10X and 40X). For the isolation, striation
   technique and serial dilutions in relation to 1:10 was applied, white
   LED lamps of 18 watts were used as a source of illumination, a
   photoperiod of 12:12 and a temperature of 25°C2. For the morphological
   identification, semipermanent preparations were made for observation in
   two types of microscope: one of phase contrast and another of
   differential interference (20X, 40X and 100X). The morphological
   characteristics were compared with specialized bibliography according to
   their microalgal group. Results: It was possible to isolate and
   morphologically identify two microorganisms from the Bosque Azul lake,
   belonging to the Lagunas de Montebello National Park, aPectinodesmus
   pectinatusmicroalgae and a cyanobacteriumLimnothrix planctonica.
   Limitations of the study/implications: It is necessary to investigate
   the implications of these microalgae groups in the trophic state of the
   Bosque Azul lake, as well as the possible toxicity that Limnothrix
   planctonica may cause in the lake fish's. Findings/conclusions: There
   are reports of lipid accumulation inPectinodesmus pectinatusthat could
   be used for the production of biofuels such as biodiesel. In the other
   hand,Limnothrix planktonichas been reported as a producer of metabolites
   with biotechnological potential in the production of lipids, pigments,
   carbohydrates and exopolysaccharides. Both microorganisms are the first
   reports in Chiapas and in the case ofLimnothrix planctonica, the first
   report in Mexico.

AB The production of microalgal biofuels seems to be viable on a large
   scale with the use of wastewater and freely available sunlight for
   cultivation of microalgae. In this review article, the scale-up and
   operational aspects have been addressed for mass production of
   microalgae using wastewater and sunlight in both open raceway pond (ORP)
   and tubular PBRs, and the outcomes of previous studies are critically
   reviewed for different cases. Suitable strategies have been proposed for
   enhancing the productivity considering operational difficulties in
   various types of PBRs such as ORP, horizontal loop tubular, and vertical
   tubular column. The importance of mapping of solar intensity and
   rainfall data is discussed in the context of large scale production. The
   costs of biodiesel production evaluated by several researchers were
   found to vary with respect to the followed route/path in their analyzes.
   These evaluations are compared with respect to the objectives of this
   study.

AB Microalgae have expanded their roles as renewable and sustainable
   feedstocks for biofuel, smart nutrition, biopharmaceutical,
   cosmeceutical, biosensing, and space technologies. They accumulate
   valuable biochemical compounds from protein, carbohydrate, and lipid
   groups, including pigments and carotenoids. Microalgal biomass, which
   can be adopted for multivalorization under biorefinery settings, allows
   not only the production of various biofuels but also other value-added
   biotechnological products. However, state-of-the-art technologies are
   required to optimize yield, quality, and the economical aspects of both
   upstream and downstream processes. As such, the need to use
   microfluidic-based devices for both fundamental research and industrial
   applications of microalgae, arises due to their microscale sizes and
   dilute cultures. Microfluidics-based devices are superior to their
   competitors through their ability to perform multiple functions such as
   sorting and analyzing small amounts of samples (nanoliter to picoliter)
   with higher sensitivities. Here, we review emerging applications of
   microfluidic technologies on microalgal processes in cell sorting,
   cultivation, harvesting, and applications in biofuels, biosensing, drug
   delivery, and nutrition.

AB This study focuses on the laboratory production of jet fuel from
   microalgae. In contrast with many studies that use partial nutrient
   starvation to boost lipid content of the species, physiological
   modification was undertaken under complete nutrient starvation for 3
   days to increase lipid content beyond 80%. This was followed by biomass
   harvesting, which was necessary for downstream processes. Large amounts
   of biomass were achieved between day 8 and day 10 during the cultivation
   period, with temperatures ranging between 15 and 35°C under constant
   luminance of 1000 lux and daily supply of CO2 for 15 days. It was found
   that Nannochloropsis sp. grew effectively between 15°C and 25°C with
   more biomass produced in the same temperature range. Conversion
   processes involved steps such as oil extraction, thermal cracking
   without catalyst at 300°C and fractionation between 70°C and 250°C. The
   pyrolysis of bio-oil was also undertaken as a fast cracking process for
   the temperature ranging between 350°C and 450°C within 12 s. Some
   parameters such as flash point, net heat of combustion, sulfur, and
   viscosity complied with ASTM standards. Jet fuel from microalgae
   therefore shows potential despite many challenges related to cost
   effectiveness and sustainability. In order to obtain a bio-jet fuel that
   is completely compliant with ASTM standards, upgrading, reforming
   processes, and the use of additives will be needed more, especially for
   pilot and large-scale production once fuel sustainability is achieved.

AB Microalgae, a promising sustainable biomass resource, lacks sufficient
   research for pilot-scale processes despite available technologies.
   Harvesting methods also pose challenges for large-scale applications. To
   address this, the economically viable large-scale microalgae harvesting
   system is here presented. The design integrates dissolved air flotation
   (5 m3/h) and screw-press filtration (10 kg/h), minimizing energy
   consumption suitable for industrial processes. This system efficiently
   harvests chlorella sp. (up to 4.1 m3) with a biomass harvest efficiency
   of 93% and a dewatering rate of 11.9%. Compared to centrifugation, the
   multi-stage system improves energy efficiency by 60.5% with 1.7 kWh/m3
   of energy consumption. This innovative approach demonstrates the
   potential for large-scale microalgae biomass harvesting.

AB In contrast to single cellular species, detailed information is lacking
   on the processes of photosynthetic acclimation for colonial algae,
   although these algae are important for biofuel production, ecosystem
   biodiversity, and wastewater treatment. To investigate differences
   between single cellular and colonial species, we studied the regulation
   of photosynthesis and photoprotection during photoacclimation for the
   colonial green algaBotryococcus brauniiand made a comparison with the
   properties of the single cellular speciesChlamydomonas reinhardtii. We
   show thatB. brauniishares some high-light (HL) photoacclimation
   strategies withC. reinhardtiiand other frequently studied green algae:
   decreased chlorophyll content, increased free carotenoid content, and
   increased nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Additionally,B. brauniihas
   unique HL photoacclimation strategies, related to its colonial form:
   strong internal shading by an increase of the colony size and the
   accumulation of extracellular echinenone (a ketocarotenoid). HL colonies
   are larger and more spatially heterogenous than low-light colonies.
   Compared with surface cells, cells deeper inside the colony have
   increased pigmentation and larger photosystem II antenna size. The core
   of the largest of the HL colonies does not contain living cells. In
   contrast withC. reinhardtii, but similar to other biofilm-forming algae,
   NPQ capacity is substantial in low light. In HL, NPQ amplitude
   increases, but kinetics are unchanged. We discuss possible causes of the
   different acclimation responses ofC. reinhardtiiandB. braunii. Knowledge
   of the specific photoacclimation processes for this colonial green alga
   further extends the view of the diversity of photoacclimation strategies
   in photosynthetic organisms.

AB Ocean resources have been exploited at unprecedented rates, leading to
   marine biodiversity loss, food web changes, and other alterations of
   ocean ecosystem functions and structures. The capture of wild fish for
   human consumption and fishmeal are the primary drivers. Microalgae oil
   has long been investigated for biofuel production. Its co-product,
   defatted microalgal biomass, has potential to replace fishmeal from wild
   fish catch and thus mitigate ocean resource depletion. This study
   develops a new indicator for assessing consequential impacts on ocean
   resources in life cycle assessment. The indicator is based on primary
   production required, a concept previously used in ecological assessments
   and life cycle assessments to evaluate ecological impacts of fisheries
   and aquaculture. We estimate the primary production required for
   fishmeal production from the ocean (166 kg carbon/kg fishmeal), and the
   potential of defatted microalgae biomass displacing fishmeal. Results
   show that defatted microalgae biomass can lead to highly variable, but
   potentially significant, reductions in ocean resource demand. The
   variability is a function of the potential for replacement, which
   depends on the cultured fish species considered. As an example of this
   significance, based on available data for estimating the potential for
   defatted microalgal biomass to displace fishmeal for cultured tilapia,
   salmon, shrimp, carp, flounder, yellowtail and cod, by 2020 net primary
   production demand from the ocean could be reduced by approximately one
   billion tons of carbon.

   positively charged over a wide pH range below 9.5, which gave them a
   flocculation potential for negatively charged microalgae. As flocculants
   were in-situ generated and gradually released, microalgae flocs formed
   in a snowballing mode, resulting in the compaction of large flocs. When
   higher current density was applied, microalgae could be harvested more
   rapidly, although there was a trade-off between a higher energy use and
   more residual aluminium in the culture medium. Benefits of this
   flocculation method are twofold: the phosphate decrease in
   post-harvesting could improve nutrient removal in microalgae based
   wastewater treatment, while the ammonium increase may favor microalgae
   recovery for medium recycling.

AB Microalgae are currently emerging as one of the most promising
   alternative sources for the next generation of food, feed, cosmetics and
   renewable energy in the form of biofuel. Microalgae constitute a diverse
   group of microorganisms with advantages like fast and efficient growth.
   In addition, they do not compete for arable land and offer very high
   lipid yield potential. Major challenges for the development of this
   resource are to select lipid-rich strains using high-throughput staining
   for neutral lipid content in microalgae species. For this purpose, the
   fluorescent dyes most commonly used to quantify lipids are Nile red and
   BODIPY 505/515. Their fluorescent staining for lipids offers a rapid and
   inexpensive analysis tool to measure neutral lipid content, avoiding
   time-consuming and costly gravimetric analysis. This review collates and
   presents recent advances in algal lipid staining and focuses on Nile red
   and BODIPY 505/515 staining characteristics. The available literature
   addresses the limitations of fluorescent dyes under certain conditions,
   such as spectral properties, dye concentrations, cell concentrations,
   temperature and incubation duration. Moreover, the overall conclusion of
   the present review study gives limitations on the use of fluorochrome
   for screening of lipid-rich microalgae species and suggests improved
   protocols for staining recalcitrant microalgae and recommendations for
   the staining quantification.

AB Although they are the largest taxonomic group of animals, relatively few
   insects have been examined for symbiotic relationships with
   micro-organisms. However, this is rapidly changing because of the
   potential for examination of the natural insect-microbe-lignocellulose
   interactions to provide insights for biofuel technology. Micro-organisms
   associated with lignocellulose-consuming insects often facilitate the
   digestion of the recalcitrant plant diet; therefore these microbial
   communities may be mined for novel lignocellulose-degrading microbes, or
   for robust and inexpensive biocatalysts necessary for economically
   feasible biofuel production from lignocellulose. These insect-microbe
   interactions are influenced by the ecosystem and specific lignocellulose
   diet, and appreciating the whole
   ecosystem-insect-microbiota-lignocellulose as a natural biorefinery
   provides a rich and diverse framework from which to design novel
   industrial processes. One such natural biorefinery, the Tipula
   abdominalis larvae in riparian ecosystems, is reviewed herein with
   applications for biochemical processes and overcoming challenges
   involved in conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuel ethanol. From
   the dense and diverse T. abdominalis larval hindgut microbial community,
   a cellulolytic bacterial isolate, 27C64, demonstrated enzymatic activity
   toward many model plant polymers and also produced a bacterial
   antibiotic. 27C64 was co-cultured with yeast in fermentation of pine to
   ethanol, which allowed for a 20% reduction of commercial enzyme. In this
   study, a micro-organism from a lignocellulose-consuming insect was
   successfully applied for improvement of biomass-to-biofuel technology.

AB Worldwide threats of fuel shortages in the near future and climate
   change because of greenhouse gas emissions are posing severe challenges
   and therefore it is vital to search for sustainable ways of preventing
   the consequences. The dual use of microalgae for phycoremediation and
   biomass production for sustainable biofuel production is a viable
   choice. Phycoremediation of As(III) and As(V) ions using microalgae was
   investigated in a two-staged batch reactor. Accumulation and toxicity of
   inorganic arsenic forms (As(III) and As(V)) to green microalgae
   Botryococcus braunii depend on environmental factors. Dissolved oxygen
   and pH cycles did not significantly differ due to the absence or
   presence of arsenic (either As(III) or As(V)) ions in the culture. Monod
   model was utilized for representing the growth kinetics of microalgae in
   pure media containing various concentrations of nitrate ions. Maximum
   specific growth rate and saturation constant were found to be 0.14788
   d-1 and 0.00105 g/L, respectively. With the increase in concentration of
   phosphate in growth medium, the growth of microalgae increased. Media
   with NaCl (1.0 g/L) and NaHCO3 (1 g/L) resulted in higher maximum
   biomass concentration. Effect of coexisting ions on phycoremediation of
   As(III) and As(V) ions using microalgae was studied.

AB Nannochloropsisis rapidly emerging as a model organism for the study of
   biofuel production in microalgae. Here, we report a high-quality genomic
   assembly ofNannochloropsis gaditana, consisting of large contigs, up to
   500 kbp long, and scaffolds that in most cases span the entire length of
   the chromosomes. We identified 10646 complete genes and characterized
   possible alternative transcripts. The annotation of the predicted genes
   and the analysis of cellular processes revealed traits relevant for the
   genetic improvement of this organism such as genes involved in DNA
   recombination, RNA silencing, and cell wall synthesis. We also analyzed
   the modification of the transcriptional profile in nitrogen deficiency -
   a condition known to stimulate lipid accumulation. While the content of
   lipids increased, we did not detect major changes in expression of the
   genes involved in their biosynthesis. At the same time, we observed a
   very significant down-regulation of mitochondrial gene expression,
   suggesting that part of the Acetyl-CoA and NAD(P)H, normally oxidized
   through the mitochondrial respiration, would be made available for fatty
   acids synthesis, increasing the flux through the lipid biosynthetic
   pathway. Finally, we released an information resource of the genomic
   data ofN. gaditana, available online at www.nannochloropsis.org.

AB Algal biomass has been gaining attention over the last decades as it is
   versatile and can be used in different industries, such as wastewater
   treatment and bioenergy industries. Microalgae are mixotrophic
   microorganisms that have potential to utilize nitrogen and phosphate
   (nutrients) and remove organic matters from wastewater streams.
   Phycoremediation is an intriguing and cost-efficient technique to
   simultaneously remove heavy metals from wastewater while removing
   nutrients and organic matters. The cultivated and produced algal biomass
   can be a promising candidate and a sustainable feedstock to produce
   biofuels (e.g., biodiesel, bio-alcohol, and bio-oil) and value-added
   products such as biochar, glycerol, functional food, and pigments. The
   algae suspended cultivation systems, WSP and HRAP, are efficient methods
   for the wastewater treatment in shallow ponds with no mechanical
   aeration and less required energy consumption, but when a short HRT and
   minimum evaporation losses are key points in the algal cultivation the
   PBRs are recommended. It was reported that biosorption and
   bioaccumulation are the two promising techniques of phycoremediation.
   Studies showed that among the current processes of algal biomass
   conversion to biofuels, transesterification of algal lipids and
   pyrolysis of algal biomass were found to be the most efficient
   techniques. This review paper investigates the applications of algal
   biomass in the phycoremediation of wastewater, productions of bioenergy
   and value-added products by reviewing articles mainly published over the
   last five years.

AB Given increasing energy demand and global warming potential, the
   advancements in bioenergy production have become a key factor in
   combating these issues. Biorefineries have been effective in converting
   biomass into energy and valuable products with the added benefits of
   treating wastewater used as a cultivation medium. Recent developments
   enable relationships between sewage sludge and microalgae that could
   lead to higher biomass and energy yields. This study proposes a
   multi-objective optimization model that would assist stakeholders in
   designing an integrated system consisting of wastewater treatment
   systems, an algal-based bioenergy park, and a sludge-based bioenergy
   park that would decide which processes to use in treating wastewater and
   sludge while minimizing cost and carbon emissions. The baseline run of
   the model showed that the three plants were utilized in treating both
   sludge and water for the optimal answer. Running the model with no
   storage prioritizes water disposal, while having storage can help
   produce more energy. Sensitivity analysis was performed on storage costs
   and demand. Results show that decreasing the demand is directly
   proportional to the total costs while increasing it can help reduce
   expected costs through storage and utilizing process capacities. Costs
   of storage do not cause a huge overall difference in costs and directly
   follow the change.

   Negative externalities associated with food and resource allocation have

   Minimizing, or truncating, the chlorophyll antenna size of the

   efficiency and productivity up to 3-fold. Generation of truncated
   light-harvesting chlorophyll antenna size (tla) strains, in all classes

   to maximize solar-to-product energy conversion efficiency and

AB Generation of biodiesel from microalgae grown in wastewater can offer a
   cost-effective approach, whilst wastewaters usually do not contain the
   optimum concentrations of the essential nutrients and carbon sources
   that result in lowering the productivities of biomass and lipid. This
   study aimed to overcome this limitation by manipulating wastewater with
   various concentrations of nutrients (NO3-, PO43-, Cl- and SO42-) and
   three carbon sources either individually or in combination to cultivate
   Micractinium reisseri for biodiesel production. Initially, various
   dilutions of wastewater were tested and a concentration up to 75% of
   wastewater showed the highest biomass productivity (0.076 g L-1 d-1) and
   lipid productivity (0.014 g L-1 d-1). The optimum manipulating
   conditions for maximum lipid production and the highest productivity
   required 50% decrease in phosphorous from the concentration of the
   control medium and supplementation with 1.0 g L-1 of glucose. Under this
   condition, biomass and lipid productivities increased by 1.7 and
   4-folds, respectively, compared to those observed in the control.
   Furthermore, phosphorous starvation condition in the presence of glucose
   significantly improved fatty acid profile in the biomass and biodiesel
   quality related parameters.

AB Due to their lipid accumulation potential, microalgae are widely studied
   in terms of their use in the production of biodiesel. The present study
   was focused on determination of changes in the biomass production,
   biochemical composition, accumulation and distribution of fatty acids in
   neutral lipids, glycolipids, phospholipids and biodiesel properties of
   soil microalgaEustigmatos calaminarisin response to various levels of
   nitrogen stress and indole-3-acetic acid supplementation. The highest
   growth rate, the highest lipid content and daily lipid productivity were
   noted at the nitrogen limitation up to 25% with IAA supplementation. The
   increase in NL was associated with nutrient stress. An increase in the
   level of GL and PL were recorded upon the reduction of the nitrogen
   content (25% N) and the addition of IAA. The gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry analysis demonstrated that C16:0, C16:1, and C18:1 were the
   main fatty acids inE. calaminarislipids. As shown by the lipidomic
   analysis, the IAA supplementation in the nitrogen limitation variants
   enhanced the content of TAGs in C18:1 and monounsaturated fatty acids.
   The current findings indicated a potential strategy to improve the fatty
   acid profile in neutral lipids and high potential ofE. calaminarisfor
   biodiesel applications.

AB Microalgae produced lipids, pigments, lutein, and valuable chemicals
   under stressful conditions, making them as attractive feedstock for
   biorefineries. However, high cell density culture of microalgae in harsh
   condition using seawater is still a challenge. In this study, we used
   aminobutyric acid (GABA) from anin vitrobiotransformation of monosodium
   glutamate (MSG) to alleviate salinity stress inChlorella
   sorokiniana(Cs). Initially, Chlorophylla/bcontent was suppressed under
   the stress of 20 g/L sodium chloride (NaCl), leading to an extreme
   decline in protein and pigment accumulation. While the biomass and
   protein of Cs cultured in 10 g/L NaCl reached 3.44 g/L and 1.14 g/L with
   5 mM GABA, with 56.3% and 171% increase compared to control. The optimal
   conditions were 10 mM GABA and 20 g/L NaCl in modified BG11 medium, with
   a biomass, protein, lutein and beta-carotene content of 4.56 g/L, 2.07
   g/L, 24 mg/L and 27.48 mg/L, respectively. Finally, protein from Cs was
   used as a prebiotic for cultivatingEscherichia coliNissle 1917 (EcN)
   andLactobacillus rhamnosusZY (LGG). We provided an effective and
   sustainable approach for the simultaneous production of biomass and
   high-end products by microalgae using GABA and seawater for the first
   time.

U1 4

AB The feasibility of microalgal biomass as one of the most promising and
   renewable sources for the production of biofuels is being studied
   extensively. Microalgal biomass can be cultivated under
   photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, photoheterotrophic, and mixotrophic
   cultivation conditions. Photoautotrophic cultivation is the most common
   way of microalgal biomass production. Under mixotrophic cultivation,
   microalgae can utilize both organic carbon and CO2simultaneously.
   Mixotrophic cultivation depicts higher biomass productivity as compared
   to photoautotrophic cultivation. It is evident from the literature that
   mixotrophic cultivation yields higher quantities of polyunsaturated
   fatty acids as compared to that photoautotrophic cultivation. In this
   context, for economical biomass production, the organic carbon of
   industrial wastewaters can be valorized for the mixotrophic cultivation
   of microalgae. Following the way, contaminants' load of wastewaters can
   be reduced while concomitantly producing highly productive microalgal
   biomass. This review focuses on different aspects covering the
   sustainable cultivation of different microalgal species in different
   types of wastewaters.

AB Wastewater treatment using microalgae is an eco-friendly process without

   reused, which allows efficient nutrient recycling. This review provides
   constructive information to enable progress of competent technology for
   microalgae based productions in palm oil mill effluent (POME). The
   characteristics of POME that will be described in this paper would be a
   source of pollution in water if discharged directly. Since microalgae
   have great potential to be isolated and cultivated in POME, previous
   studies to improve POME based culture media are still limited.
   Microalgae are highly competent in diminishing CO2emissions and reducing
   the organic components in POME. In conclusion, biological treatments by
   using microalgae discussed in this paper and the lipid production from
   microalgae biomass can be used as an alternative for energy production.
   The POME treatment with microalgae may meet the standards or limits
   before being discharged into the water body.

AB Micro and macroalgae are renewable and carbon-neutral sources of energy
   that can grow naturally or can be cultivated in nutrient-rich
   wastewater, without compromising the production of food crops.
   Microalgae use nutrients, accumulate heavy metals and reduce coliform
   bacteria from wastewater, thus contributing to their phytoremediation.
   Furthermore, the conversion of algae biomass into biofuels contributes
   to reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions
   in the atmosphere. Depending on the species and cultivation method,
   microalgae have a very fast growth rate (12 days) and their potential to
   produce biodiesel is 15 to 300 times higher than that of agricultural
   and energy crops conventionally used for biofuels. Lipid content in
   microalgae can reach 75-80% by weight of dry biomass. To produce 39
   billion liters of biodiesel, 15 million tons of nitrogen and 2 million
   tons of phosphorus are required during the growth process of microalgae.
   From algae cultivated in 500 billion m3 of industrial wastewater,
   approximately 37 million tons of oil can be extracted that can be
   transformed into biodiesel. However, there are also challenges in
   large-scale utilization of microalgae, due to the high energy input,
   technical difficulties encountered in harvesting unicellular microalgae,
   and the need for subsequent pretreatment operations to improve lipid
   extraction. This paper reviews the potential of microalgae species to
   thrive in wastewater and the technological achievements in converting
   microalgae biomass for the sustainable biodiesel production.

U1 4
U2 83
AB To suffice the escalating global energy demand, microalgae are deemed as
   high potential surrogate feedstocks for liquid fuels. The major
   encumbrance for the commercialization of microalgae cultivation is due
   to the high costs of nutrients such as carbon, phosphorous, and
   nitrogen. Meanwhile, the organic-rich anaerobic digestate which is
   difficult to be purified by conventional techniques is appropriate to be
   used as a low-cost nutrient source for the economic viability and
   sustainability of microalgae production. This option is also beneficial
   in terms of reutilize the organic fraction of solid waste instead of
   discarded as zero-value waste. Anaerobic digestate is the side product
   of biogas production during anaerobic digestion process, where optimum
   nutrients are needed to satisfy the physiological needs to grow
   microalgae. Besides, the turbidity, competing biological contaminants,
   ammonia and metal toxicity of the digestate are also potentially
   contributing to the inhibition of microalgae growth. Thus, this review
   is aimed to explicate the feasibility of utilizing the anaerobic
   digestate to cultivate microalgae by evaluating their potential
   challenges and solutions. The proposed potential solutions (digestate
   dilution and pre-treatment, microalgae strain selection, extra organics
   addition, nitrification and desulfurization) corresponding to the
   state-of-the-art challenges are applicable as future directions of the
   research.

   overview of the productivity and growth of microalgae, the recovery of
   lipids from the microalgae, and chemical compositions of microalgae
   biomass and microalgal oil. Second, three basic approaches are discussed
   to downstream processing for the production of green gasoline and diesel
   hydrocarbons from microalgae oil, including cracking with zeolite,
   hydrotreating with supported sulfided catalysts and hydrodeoxygenation
   with non-sulfide metal catalysts. For the triglyceride derived
   bio-fuels, only "drop-in" gasoline and diesel range components are
   discussed in this review.

AB Hydrobionts are considered as highly potential source for bioproduction
   (including energy carriers and fertilizers) and many biotechnological
   processes that include hydrobionts, particularly their biomass as a
   substrate are used in different fields of energy, cosmetology, medicine,
   pharmaceutics, aquaculture, agriculture, forestry etc. Latest
   developments prove efficiency in applying anaerobic digestion for
   purifying wastewaters from organic pollutants with the help of
   macrophytes and microphytes in conducting biomethanogenesis. Many
   studies have established that it is possible to reach high level of
   lipid extraction from algae (to 95%) with the help of organic solvents
   (methanol, acetone, hexane, diethyl ether etc). Blue-green algae biomass
   has been scientifically proved to be a good source for methane,
   methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, biodiesel and other biofuel
   types production. Macroalgae and microalgae contain beta- carotene,
   biotin, folic acid, fucoidans, lectins, phenolics, sulphated
   polysaccharides and other derived biologically active compounds that can
   be used in producing vitamins, have anti-ulcer, antioxidant, antibiotic,
   antifouling, immune modulatory and other properties.Cyanidioschyzon
   merolae,Ostreococcus lucimarinus,O. tauri,Micromonas pusillahave shown
   high potential for hydrogen production whileRhizoclonium sp.has been
   experimentally used as a bounding material in briquetting miscanthus
   granules, resulting in 20% higher dynamic strength. The article is a
   literature review and the purpose of this work is to classify and
   systemize hydrobionts, reveal regularity of their growth, conduct
   critical analysis on existing biotechnologies on using separate
   representatives of aquatic biomes as a raw material and also to review
   ways of intensification for these biotechnologies.

AB Microalgae exhibit remarkable potential as a feedstock for biofuel
   production compared with other sources, owing to their high areal
   productivity, low environmental effect, and negligible influence on food
   security. However, the primary obstacle to the commercialization of
   algae-based biofuels is the high economic cost due to the low-yield
   lipid content in the microalgae biomass. Maximizing biomass and lipid
   production is crucial to improve the economic viability of microalgae
   for biofuels. Identifying appropriate algal strains, particularly from
   indigenous environments, and developing those 'platform strains' using
   mutagenesis and genetic-engineering techniques is preferable. The
   provided discussion of conventional methods to increase microalgae's
   biomass and lipid productivity mostly entailed adjusting environmental
   (such as temperature, light, and salinity) and nutritional (such as
   nitrogen and phosphorus) parameters. This review illustrated a
   comprehensive overview of biotechnological approaches and the recent
   strategies to enhance the lipid productivity of microalgae. The research
   also emphasized the need to streamline engineering strategies with the
   aid of recent advancements in DNA-manipulation techniques to hinder the
   existing biological intricacies in lipogenesis. This review also
   discussed the current economic and commercialization of this algal
   biorefinery along with the drawbacks.

AB Algae have been considered as a promising biodiesel feedstock. One of
   the major factors affecting large-scale algae technology application is
   poor wintering cultivation performance. In this study, an integrated
   approach is investigated combining freshwater microalgaeChlorella
   zofingiensiswintering cultivation in pilot-scale photobioreactors with
   artificial wastewater treatment. Mixotrophic culture with the addition
   of acetic acid (pH-regulation group) and autotrophic culture (control
   group) were designed, and the characteristics of algal growth, lipid and
   biodiesel production, and nitrogen and phosphate removal were examined.
   The results showed that, by using acetic acid three times per day to
   regulate pH at between 6.8 and 7.2, the total nitrogen (TN) and total
   phosphate (TP) removal could be increased from 45.2% to 73.5% and from
   92.2% to 100%, respectively. Higher biomass productivity of 66.94 mg
   L-1day-1with specific growth rate of 0.260 day-1was achieved in the
   pH-regulation group. The lipid content was much higher when using acetic
   acid to regulate pH, and the relative lipid productivity reached 37.48
   mg L-1day-1. The biodiesel yield in the pH-regulated group was 19.44% of
   dry weight, with 16-18 carbons as the most abundant composition for
   fatty acid methyl esters. The findings of the study prove that pH
   adjustment using acetic acid is efficient in cultivatingC.

AB Conventional fossil fuels are facing a global challenge which lead
   scientists to explore alternative fuel production from biological
   sources. The algae-based fuels are gaining rapid attention as it has
   potential to replace petroleum-based fuels. An indigenous high lipid
   producing microalgae was isolated from a freshwater pond in the
   KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The isolate was later identified
   as Chlorella vulgaris, based on partial 28S large subunit ribosomal RNA
   gene sequence. The growth kinetics, pyrolytic characteristics and
   photosynthetic efficiency of Chlorella was evaluated in vitro. The
   optimized conditions for higher biomass yield of the selected strain
   were at 4% CO2, 0.5 g l-1 NO3 and 0.04 g l-1 PO4, respectively. The
   pulse amplitude modulation results indicated that C. vulgaris could
   withstand a light intensity ranging from 150 to 350 mol photons m-2 s-1.
   Further increase in light intensity resulted in a decline of the
   electron transport rate. Carbon fixation rate, lipid content and
   calorific value of C. vulgaris was 6.17 mg l-1 h-1, 21% and 17.44 kJ
   g-1, respectively. The pyrolitic studies under inert atmosphere at
   different heating rates of 15, 30, 40 and 50°C min-1 from ambient
   temperature to 800°C showed that the overall final weight loss recorded
   for the four different heating rates was in the range of 78.9-81%. These
   studies could be useful to appraise the biofuel potential of the
   isolated C. vulgaris strain, which can later be taken for pilot scale
   production.

AB The performance of a pilot high rate algal pond (HRAP) interconnected
   with a biogas absorption column during the simultaneous upgrading of
   biogas and treatment of digestate was evaluated under two innovative
   biogas and nutrient supply strategies. Process operation with biogas
   supply during the night at a liquid recirculation/biogas ratio of 0.5 to
   prevent N2 and O2 stripping resulted in a biomethane complying with most
   international regulations for injection into natural gas grids (99.11%
   CH4, 0.50.2% CO2, 0.60.5% N2 and 0.070.08% O2). The potential of this
   technology to remove methyl mercaptan (MeSH), toluene and hexane from
   biogas (typically present at trace levels) was assessed, for the first
   time, with removal efficiencies under steady-state correlating with
   pollutant hydrophobicity (77% for hexane, 664% for MeSH and 981% for
   toluene). Finally, the supply of digestate during the dark period
   shifted both microalgae population structure and biomass composition in
   the HRAP without a significant impact on biomethane quality. Overall,
   the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous from digestate in the HRAP was
   almost complete (96-99%) regardless of the nutrient supply strategy.

AB BACKGROUND: The kinetic parameters of a model culture ofScenedesmus
   quadricaudawere assessed under low light irradiation conditions. A
   simple and reliable method was developed for the kinetic
   characterization, which avoided CO2mass transfer limitations and allowed
   the retrieval of accurate kinetic data. Biomass and oxygen yields were
   also assessed. RESULTS: A maximum specific CO2uptake rate of 0.0150.002
   gCO2g-1VS h-1and half-saturation constant of 9113 gCO2mLiq-3were
   determined forS. quadricaudaat a light intensity of 30 mol m-2s-1at
   25°C. The biomass and oxygen yields ranged from 0.045-0.137 g VS
   g-1CO2and 0.211-0.505 gO2g-1CO2, respectively, both parameters being
   dependent on the initial CO2concentration used. CONCLUSION: A simple and
   reliable methodology for the kinetic characterization of microalgal
   cultures was developed and tested. It was demonstrated that the maximum
   specific CO2uptake rate ofS. quadricaudaat 30 mol m-2s-1was higher than
   previous values reported forScenedesmuscultures exposed to light
   intensities up to 4.5 times higher but limited by CO2mass transfer. The
   methodology and results obtained are useful for determining whether or
   not to implement a given microalgal-based process under low irradiance
   conditions.

AB With increasing concerns regarding energy and environment, algae biofuel
   is generating considerable interest around the world. Nevertheless, the
   harvesting step required before downstream biomass processing is a major
   bottleneck. Commonly employed methods include addition of chemicals or
   use of mechanical equipment that increase dramatically the biofuel
   production cost. This review deals with naturally occurring processes
   that can help offset those costs by causing microalgae flocculation.
   Interaction theories are briefly reviewed. In addition, operational
   parameters such as pH, irradiance, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and
   temperature effect on microalgae flocculation are evaluated. Finally,
   microalgae flocculation is also considered from an ecological point of
   view by taking advantage of their interaction with other microorganisms.

   recently due to the growing energy demand and non-renewable nature of
   petroleum. However, high cost of production and environmental health
   related issues like excess use of inorganic fertilizers, eutrophication
   are the major constraints in commercial-scale biodiesel production.
   Besides this, solid wastes (garden-based) management is also a global
   concern. In the present study, to overcome these limitations
   vermicompost extract was tested as nutrient source to enhance growth
   performance and lipid production from a freshwater microalga (Graesiella
   emersonii MN877773). Garden wastes were first converted into
   vermicompost manure and its extract (aerobic and anaerobically digested)
   was prepared. The efficacy of the extract was then tested in combination
   with BG11 medium. The mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae in
   anaerobically digested vermicompost extract at 50:50 combination with
   BG11 medium enhanced the cell biomass (0.64 g d. wt. L-1) and lipid
   productivity (3.18 mg L-1 day-1) of microalgae by two times. Moreover,
   the combination also improved the saturated (methyl palmitate) and
   monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid) content in the test algae. The
   quality of biodiesel also complies with all the properties of biodiesel
   standard provided by India, the USA, and Europe except the cold filter
   plugging property. The combination was also found to improve the cell
   biomass (0.041 g L-1) as compared to BG11 medium in mass-scale
   cultivation. Hence, the study proved that G. emersonii grown in media
   supplemented with garden waste-based vermicompost extract had
   significant potential for mass-scale biodiesel and bioproduct
   production.

AB The effect of sugarcane molasses on lipid content and fatty acids methyl
   ester (FAME) profile byChromochloris zofingiensisis investigated in this
   work. For this purpose, the strain has been cultivated under mixotrophic
   conditions in a medium amended with specific concentrations of molasses
   (0.5 g/L, 1 g/L, and 2 g/L) able to sustain microalgae growth. Better
   biomass concentration, lipid content, and lipid productivity (1.6 g/L,
   38% wt, and 286 mg/L/day) than the control (1.32 g/L, 16% wt, and 139
   mg/L/day) were obtained with 2 g/L of molasses. The highest value of the
   total lipid content (42% wt) was reached with 1 g/L of molasses. FAME
   profile revealed a 97% composition in C16-C18 with no statistically
   meaningful differences among the three concentrations of molasses
   tested. The most represented fatty acids were C18:1 oleic (> 38% wt),
   C18:2 linoleic (> 21% wt), and C16:0 palmitic (> 14% wt). When using 2
   g/L of molasses unsaturated fatty acids reached the highest portion
   (77%) than the control (61%). Specifically, all FAMEs have been
   quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed in order to improve biodiesel
   properties. The main characteristics of biodiesel obtainable from the
   algal lipids appeared in compliance with ASTM standards for unblended
   biodiesel and fulfilled European regulations (EN 14,214 and EN 590) for
   the quality of biodiesel. Owing the compliance of the corresponding
   biodiesel characteristics with international standards, a profitable
   biodiesel can be obtained under mixotrophic conditions triggered by the
   use of a food industry waste.

AB While current approaches have limitations for efficient and
   cost-effective microalgal biofuel production, new processes, which are
   financially economic, environmentally sustainable, and ecologically
   stable, are needed. Typically, microalgae cells are small and grow
   individually. Harvest of these cells is technically difficult and it
   contributes to 20-30% of the total cost of biomass production. A new
   process of pelletized cell cultivation is described in this study to
   co-culture a filamentous fungal species with microalgae so that
   microalgae cells can be co-pelletized into fungal pellets for easier
   harvest. This new process can be applied to microalgae cultures in both
   autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions to allow microalgae cells
   attach to each other. The cell pellets, due to their large size, can be
   harvested through sieve, much easier than individual cells. This method
   has the potential to significantly decrease the processing cost for
   generating microagal biofuel or other products.

U1 1
U2 64
AB Microalgae are currently cultivated on a relatively small scale for
   nutritional products, supplements and aquaculture feed. In recent years
   there has been renewed interest in algal bioenergy, which would require
   cultivation at far greater scales. A key component of large-scale
   production systems is the delivery of CO2to the algal cells, which is
   often a limiting factor in ponds and air sparged systems. Although many
   methods of CO2supplementation to algal reactors have been investigated,
   the most commonly suggested method is still the direct injection of
   CO2enriched gas into the growth medium. A sound understanding of
   CO2gas-liquid mass transfer is critical to efficient operation of
   cultivation systems as mixing and gas compression may represent
   significant operational expenses. For carbon capture or sequestration
   through algal culture, CO2recovery is equally important, particularly
   where carbon trading is involved.Chlorella vulgariswas grown in internal
   loop airlift reactors under varied CO2partial pressures in the inlet
   gas. In these reactors, with an overall mass transfer coefficient of
   0.0094 s-1, an inlet CO2partial pressure of 0.0012 atm (1200 ppm CO2by
   volume) was sufficient to overcome any mass transfer limitations. Under
   these operating conditions, a CO2recovery of 26% resulted. Increasing
   the partial pressure of CO2in the inlet gas above 0.0012 atm did not
   increase the algal productivity and caused significant decreases in
   CO2recovery to 9.7% and 2.1% at inlet CO2partial pressures of 0.00325
   atm and 0.0145 atm respectively. Much research into algal growth is done
   without analysis of CO2gas-liquid mass transfer, using influent
   CO2partial pressures well in excess of the minimum value required to
   overcome CO2gas-liquid mass transfer limitations, even in poorly mixed
   systems. This could result in algal growth being optimised under
   conditions that are not industrially practical or desirable.

AB The use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture poses problems for the
   health of the soil and the environment. Biofertilizers and microalgal
   biostimulants emerge as an alternative to reduce these damages. This
   study aimed to understand how microalgae are inserted in the process of
   developing biofertilizers/biostimulants. A search for research articles
   was carried out in the Scopus and Web of Science databases and resulted
   in 87 relevant studies. By analyzing these articles, it was possible to
   structure this review to understand how microalgal biofertilizers and
   biostimulants act on plants. The purpose of microalgal biofertilizer is
   to add nutrients to the soil. The use of wastewater for microalgal
   growth makes the process less costly and is a treatment alternative.
   Culture media with higher levels of nitrogen, and microalgae that remove
   higher levels of nitrate result in biomass with higher levels of
   protein. Microalgal biostimulants are associated with compounds that can
   encourage plant growth. These compounds can promote enzymatic and
   antifungal activity, act similarly to phytohormones, and participate in
   the synthesis of proteins and amino acids in plants. Microalgal
   biofertilizers/biostimulants can be part of integrated biorefinery
   concepts. The integration of the production of these products with the
   development of biofuels increases the economic viability of these
   bioproducts. Even though there is a lot of talk about the use of
   biorefineries, there are few studies on the effective application of
   this concept with the use of microalgal biomass. An in-depth analysis of
   the mechanism of action of microalgae in the development of bioproducts
   for agriculture can make the process more economically advantageous and
   sustainable.

AB Ecotoxicological tests provide information about the possible harmful
   effects that certain substances can cause on living beings. Thus, this
   review article is an analysis of ecotoxicological tests developed in
   recent years to determine the toxicity of hydrocarbons in aquatic
   samples, especially candidate fuels or biofuels, which use different
   organisms that can provide valuable and necessary information about the
   consequences that these compounds can have in the trophic chain. In the
   process of developing new compounds or products derived from
   hydrocarbons, it is important to know the cause-effect relationship that
   the development of the product may have on the environment, hence the
   importance of using these tests to select the most suitable and least
   harmful product, thus discarding the production of those that could have
   deleterious effects and cause environmental catastrophes. The organisms
   normally used for analyzing aqueous or dissolved samples are: zebrafish
   (Danio rerio); microcrustaceans (Daphniasp.); microalgae
   (Scenedesmussp.,Chlorellasp., among others); and marine bacteria
   (Aliivibrio fischeri); being part of them, or the organisms as such,
   object of study. This seeks to understand the effect that the compound
   can have on them, providing important information at different trophic
   levels.

AB The increase in global pollution, industrialization and fast economic
   progress are considered to inflict serious consequences to the quality
   and availability of water throughout the world. Wastewater is generated
   from three major sources, i.e. industrial, agricultural, and municipal
   which contain pollutants, such as: xenobiotics, microplastics, heavy
   metals and augmented by high amount of carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen
   compounds. Wastewater treatment is one of the most pressing issues since
   it cannot be achieved by any specific technology because of the varying
   nature and concentrations of pollutants and efficiency of the treatment
   technologies. The degradation capacity of these conventional treatment
   technologies is limited, especially regarding heavy metals, nutrients,
   and xenobiotics, steering the researchers to bioremediation using
   microalgae (Phycoremediation). Bioremediation can be defined as use of
   microalgae for removal or biotransformation of pollutants and CO2 from
   wastewater with concomitant biomass production. However, the usage of
   wastewaters for the bulk cultivation of microalgae is advantageous for
   reducing carbon, nutrients cost, minimizing the consumption of
   freshwater, nitrogen, phosphorus recovery, and removal of other
   pollutants from wastewater and producing sufficient biomass for value
   addition for either biofuels or other value-added compounds. Several
   types of microalgae like Chlorella and Dunaliella have proved their
   applicability in the treatment of wastewaters. The bottlenecks
   concerning the microalgal wastewater bioremediation need to be
   identified and elucidated to proceed in bioremediation using microalgae.
   This objective of this paper is to provide an insight about the
   treatment of different wastewaters using microalgae and microalgal
   potential in the treatment of wastewaters containing heavy metals and
   emerging contaminants, with the specialized cultivation systems. This
   review also summarizes the end use applications of microalgal biomass
   which makes the bioremediation aspect more environmentally sustainable.

U1 13
U2 203
AB Microalgae, due to various environmental stresses, constantly tune their
   cellular mechanisms to cope with them. The accumulation of the stress
   metabolites is closely related to the changes occurring in their
   metabolic pathways. The biosynthesis of metabolites can be triggered by
   a number of abiotic stresses like temperature, salinity, UV-radiation
   and nutrient deprivation. Although, microalgae have been considered as
   an alternative sustainable source for nutraceutical products like
   pigments and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to cater the
   requirement of emerging human population but inadequate biomass
   generation makes the process economically impractical. The stress
   metabolism for carotenoid regulation in green algae is a 2-step
   metabolism. There are a few major stresses which can influence the
   formation of phycobiliprotein in cyanobacteria. This review would
   primarily focus on the cellular level changes under stress conditions
   and their corresponding effects on lipids (including omega-3 PUFAs),
   pigments and polymers.

TI Screening suitability of Northern hemisphere algal strains for

SO Molecules
VL 25

PY 2020
U1 0
U2 12
AB Rapid rises in atmospheric CO2 levels derived from fossil fuel
   combustion are imposing urgent needs for renewable substitutes. One
   environmentally friendly alternative is biodiesel produced from suitable
   microalgal fatty acids. Algal strains normally grow
   photoautotrophically, but this is problematic in Northern areas because
   of the light limitations for much of the year. Mixotrophic and
   particularly heterotrophic strains could be valuable, especially if they
   can be cultivated in municipal wastewater with contents of nutrients
   such as nitrogen and phosphorous that should be reduced before release
   into receiving water. Thus, the aim of this study was to screen for
   microalgal strains suitable for heterotrophic cultivation with a cheap
   carbon source (glycerol) for biodiesel production in Nordic, and other
   high-latitude, countries. One of the examined strains, a Desmodesmus sp.
   strain designated 2-6, accumulated biomass at similar rates in
   heterotrophic conditions with 40 mM glycerol as in autotrophic
   conditions. Furthermore, in heterotrophic conditions it produced more
   fatty acids, and ca. 50% more C18:1 fatty acids, as well as showing a
   significant decrease in C18:3 fatty acids, all of which are highly
   desirable features for biodiesel production.

VL 36

U1 7
U2 110
AB Landfilling of municipal waste, an environmental challenge worldwide,
   results in the continuous formation of significant amounts of leachate,
   which poses a severe contamination threat to ground and surface water
   resources. Landfill leachate (LL) is generated by rainwater percolating
   through disposed waste materials and must be treated effectively before
   safe discharge into the environment. LL contains numerous pollutants and
   toxic substances, such as dissolved organic matter, inorganic chemicals,
   heavy metals, and anthropogenic organic compounds. Currently, LL
   treatment is carried out by a combination of physical, chemical, and
   microbial technologies. Microalgae are now viewed as a promising
   sustainable addition to the repertoire of technologies for treating LL.
   Photosynthetic algae have been shown to grow in LL under laboratory
   conditions, while some species have also been employed in larger-scale
   LL treatments. Treating leachate with algae can contribute to
   sustainable waste management at existing landfills by remediating
   low-quality water for recycling and reuse and generating large amounts
   of algal biomass for cost-effective manufacturing of biofuels and
   bioproducts. In this review, we will examine LL composition, traditional
   leachate treatment technologies, LL toxicity to algae, and the potential
   of employing algae at LL treatment facilities. Emphasis is placed on how
   algae can be integrated with existing technologies for biological
   treatment of LL, turning leachate from an environmental liability to an
   asset that can produce value-added biofuels and bioproducts for the
   bioeconomy.

TI Phospholipid metabolism in an industry microalga Chlorella sorokiniana:
   the impact of inoculum sizes.
SO PLoS ONE

IS 8
PS e70827
PY 2013
U1 0
U2 9
AB Chlorella sorokiniana is an important industry microalga potential for
   biofuel production. Inoculum size is one of the important factors in
   algal large-scale culture, and has great effects on the growth, lipid
   accumulation and metabolism of microalgae. As the first barrier of cell
   contents, membrane plays a vital role in algal inoculum-related
   metabolism. The knowledge of phospholipids, the main membrane component
   and high accumulation of phospholipids as the major content of total
   lipids mass in some microalgae, is necessary to understand the role of
   membrane in cell growth and metabolism under different inoculum density.
   Profiling of C. sorokiniana phospholipids with LC-MS led to the
   identification of 119 phospholipid species. To discover the phospholipid
   molecules most related to change of inoculum sizes, Partial Least
   Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was employed and the results
   revealed that inoculum sizes significantly affected phospholipid
   profiling. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl- ethanolamine (PE)
   and several phosphatidylcholine (PC) species might play an important
   role under our experimental conditions. Further analysis of these
   biomarkers indicated that cell membrane status of C. sorokiniana might
   play an important role in the adaption to the inoculum sizes. And the
   culture with inoculum size of 1*106 cells mL-1 presented the best
   membrane status with the highest content of PC and PG, and the lowest
   content of PE. We discovered that the inoculum size of 1*106 cells mL-1
   might provide the best growth condition for C. sorokiniana. Also we
   proposed that PG, PE and several PC may play an important role in
   inoculum-related metabolism in C. sorokiniana, which may work through
   thylakoid membrane and photosynthetic pathway. Thus this study would
   provide more potential targets for metabolic engineering to improve
   biofuel production and productivity in microalgae.

AB Microalgal starch is a potential feedstock for biofuel production. The
   effects of KNO3and MgSO4concentrations and light intensity on biomass
   and starch production by the marine microalga,Tetraselmis
   subcordiformis, were investigated. Under 200 mol m-2s-1irradiance and
   sulfur-deprived conditions, a starch productivity of 0.62 g L-1d-1and a
   starch content of 62.1% based on dry weight (DW) was achieved. A starch
   content of 54.3% was achieved under low irradiance and nitrogen
   starvation, which was 6.5% higher than that under nutrient- and
   light-sufficient conditions. Photosynthetic activity was indispensable
   for starch accumulation. It is difficult to reach high starch
   productivity and starch concentration simultaneously. Proper nutrient
   concentrations are necessary to achieve high starch productivity or
   starch concentration based on the target. The high starch productivity
   and starch content suggest thatT. subcordiformisis a promising
   microalgal starch producer.

TI Utilization of microalgae for bio-jet fuel production in the aviation

SO Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
VL 149
PY 2021
U1 11
U2 133
AB Aviation sector discharges approximately 2% of the global anthropogenic
   CO2,and the proportion is growing. The search for cost-effective and
   environmental-friendly bio-jet fuels derived from natural resources is
   gaining momentum. The microalgae cultivation conditions including
   temperature, pH, light intensity and nutrients have shown significant
   influence on the microalgae growth rate and chemical composition, which
   create the opportunities to enhance the yield and quality of microalgae
   bio-jet fuel. This review is focused on the hydroprocessing method for
   converting microalgae oil into bio-jet fuel, as well as the novel
   conceptual approaches for bio-jet fuel production such as gasification
   with Fischer-Tropsch and sugar-to-jet. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of
   biomass is one of the best alternative ways to replace natural aviation
   fuel due to the high maximum energy efficiency and low emission of
   greenhouse gas. In addition, hydroprocessing with the aid of Ni and
   zeolites catalysts has successfully converted the microalgae biodiesel
   to bio-jet fuel with high yield and alkane selectivity. Among these
   techniques, hydroprocessing used the lowest production cost with the
   longest duration, whereas the bio-jet fuel with high selectivity
   (C8-C16) could be produced by using gasification with the
   Fischer-Tropsch process. Consequently, gasification and Fischer-Tropsch
   and sugar-to-jet can become the future alternative process to convert
   microalgae to bio-jet fuel. The development of microalgae bio-jet fuel
   will increase the security of energy supply and reduce the fuel expenses
   in aviation industry.

AB While engineering of new biofuels pathways into microbial hosts has
   received considerable attention, innovations in bioprocessing are
   required for commercialization of both conventional and next-generation
   fuels. For ethanol and butanol, reducing energy costs for product
   recovery remains a challenge. Fuels produced from heterologous aerobic
   pathways in yeast and bacteria require control of aeration and cooling
   at large scales. Converting lignocellulosic biomass to sugars for fuels
   production requires effective biomass pretreatment to increase surface
   area, decrystallize cellulose and facilitate enzymatic hydrolysis.
   Effective means to recover microalgae and extract their intracellular
   lipids remains a practical and economic bottleneck in algal biodiesel
   production.

AB Increasing energy prices demand a renewable, carbon neutral, transport
   fuel that is environmentally and commercially sustainable. The interest
   in the production of microalgae as biofuels is increasing due to their
   high oil content, rapid biomass production and small foot print. In this
   research, marine microalgaeDunaliella tertiolecta(Chlorophyceae)
   andThalassiosira pseudonana(Bacillariophyceae) were incubated in
   nitrogen (N)-replete medium, and then transferred to N-free medium for
   15 and 11 days, respectively. Fluorescence induction and relaxation
   (FIRe) fluorometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
   were used to monitor the photosynthetic performance, lipid production
   and metabolic responses to changing N availability. Growth rates ofD.
   tertiolectaandT. pseudonanawere 0.840.16 d-1and 1.210.09 d-1,
   respectively in N-replete medium. Upon transfer to N-free medium. The
   growth rates ofT. pseudonanadeclined rapidly, whileD.
   tertiolectacontinued to grow for 5 days in N-free medium before growth
   declined slowly. The maximum quantum yield of photochemistry (Fv/Fm)
   remained high initially forD. tertiolectabut decreased immediately after
   transfer to N-free media forT. pseudonana. The functional absorption
   cross section for PSII (sigmaPSII) increased, the time constant for
   QAreoxidation (tauQa) and connectivity factor (p) decreased in parallel
   to the nutritional status of the microalgae. The relative protein and
   lipid content varied in response to N limitation, but carbohydrates did
   not change. Based on FTIR,D. tertiolectaandT. pseudonanaproduced 20-26%
   lipid when most stressed. The combination of photosynthetic efficiency
   and biomass composition monitoring provided evidence that metabolic
   strategies to changing nutrient status are species-specific.

AB The optimization of bio-diesel production depends on numerous parameters
   such as renewable biological triglyceride sources, type of catalyst and
   alcohol for the transesterification reaction, molar ratio of
   oil-alcohol, and heating sources. In this review we will highlight the
   use of microwave (MW) radiation for bio-diesel production and its
   advantage over other heating sources, starting with a comparison between
   the two-stage method consisting of oil extraction (the first step) and
   bio-diesel production by transesterification (the second step), with a
   one-stage method that provides direct transesterification of a
   feed-stock without the extraction step. A comparison will be made for
   the one- and two-stage methods performed under microwave heating,
   sonication, and reflux using SrO, KOH, and NaOH catalysts for bio-diesel
   production. The various feed-stocks reviewed in this perspective are
   triolein, soybean oil, microalgae biomass ofNannochloropsis, and castor
   and jatropha seeds. The extension of the microwave-heating methodology
   to continuous-flow processing has been used to scale up the reaction.
   Moreover, the presented continuous-flow bio-diesel preparation is
   doneviaa novel laminar flow reactor-separator. This instrument not only
   enables to scale up the reaction, but also allows glycerol as a
   byproduct to phase separate and settle from the reacting flow.

AB Microalgae biomasses are considered promising feedstocks for biofuel and
   methane productions. Two Continuously Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTR), fed
   with fresh (CSTR-C) and heat pre-treated (CSTR-T) Chlorella biomass were
   run in parallel in order to determine methane productions. The methane
   yield was 1.5 times higher in CSTR-T with regard to CSTR-C. Aiming to
   understand the microorganism roles within of the reactors, the sludge
   used as an inoculum (I), plus raw (CSTR-C) and heat pre-treated (CSTR-T)
   samples were analyzed by high-throughput pyrosequencing. The bacterial
   communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi
   and Firmicutes. Spirochaetae and Actinobacteria were only detected in
   sample I. Proteobacteria, mainly Alfaproteobacteria, were by far the
   dominant phylum within of the CSTR-C bioreactor. Many of the sequences
   retrieved were related to bacteria present in activated sludge treatment
   plants and they were absent after thermal pre-treatment. Most of the
   sequences affiliated to the Bacteroidetes were related to uncultured
   groups. Anaerolineaceae was the sole family found of the Chloroflexi
   phylum. All of the genera identified of the Firmicutes phylum carried
   out macromolecule hydrolysis and by-product fermentation. The
   proteolytic bacteria were prevalent over the saccharolytic microbes. The
   percentage of the proteolytic genera increased from the inoculum to the
   CSTR-T sample in a parallel fashion with an available protein increase
   owing to the high protein content of Chlorella. To relate the taxa
   identified by high-throughput sequencing to their functional roles
   remains a future challenge.

AB Background Future sustainable energy production can be achieved using
   mass cultures of photoautotrophic microorganisms, which are engineered
   to synthesize valuable products directly from CO2and sunlight. As
   cyanobacteria can be cultivated in large scale on non-arable land, these
   phototrophic bacteria have become attractive organisms for production of
   biofuels. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, one of the cyanobacterial model
   organisms, provides many attractive properties for biofuel production
   such as tolerance of seawater and high light intensities. Results Here,
   we performed a systems analysis of an engineered ethanol-producing
   strain of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, which was grown
   in artificial seawater medium over 30 days applying a 12:12 h day-night
   cycle. Biosynthesis of ethanol resulted in a final accumulation of 0.25%
   (v/v) ethanol, including ethanol lost due to evaporation. The
   cultivation experiment revealed three production phases. The highest
   production rate was observed in the initial phase when cells were
   actively growing. In phase II growth of the producer strain stopped, but
   ethanol production rate was still high. Phase III was characterized by a
   decrease of both ethanol production and optical density of the culture.
   Metabolomics revealed that the carbon drain due to ethanol diffusion
   from the cell resulted in the expected reduction of pyruvate-based
   intermediates. Carbon-saving strategies successfully compensated the
   decrease of central intermediates of carbon metabolism during the first
   phase of fermentation. However, during long-term ethanol production the
   producer strain showed clear indications of intracellular carbon
   limitation. Despite the decreased levels of glycolytic and tricarboxylic
   acid cycle intermediates, soluble sugars and even glycogen accumulated
   in the producer strain. The changes in carbon assimilation patterns are
   partly supported by proteome analysis, which detected decreased levels
   of many enzymes and also revealed the stress phenotype of
   ethanol-producing cells. Strategies towards improved ethanol production
   are discussed. Conclusions Systems analysis of ethanol production in
   Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 revealed initial compensation followed by
   increasing metabolic limitation due to excessive carbon drain from
   primary metabolism.

AB Commercial-scale production of microalgae biomass for biofuel and
   biochemicals requires a substantial amount of water and nutrients. Many
   studies are conducted to explore the potential of various aqueous
   streams originating from harvesting stage and different energy recovery
   steps as an alternative for water and nutrient supply. Presence of toxic
   organic compounds, unassimilated ions, particulate matter, and high
   alkalinity in post-harvest water limit its recyclability. Nutrient
   recovery from biomass via anaerobic digestion (AD) and various
   hydrothermal processes is being explored. So, there is a need to
   understand the impact of harvesting methods, nature and impact of
   organic compounds, buildup of algogenic organic matter (OM), amount of
   unused nutrients, and salinity on water recycling. Optimum conditions
   for maximum nutrient recovery from AD and hydrothermal processes are
   discussed for effective nutrient recycling. This review is an attempt to
   understand the challenges associated with the recycling of aqueous
   streams for water and nutrient requirement for sustainable microalgae
   cultivation. The effectiveness of a recycling stream is defined here as
   "biomass ratio." Possible growth inhibiting factors are identified, and
   their solutions are suggested along with potential directions for future
   research. Large-scale sustainable cultivation of microalgae through
   recycling of different streams depends on better understanding of
   biological activity of algal OM through detailed characterization and
   in-depth understanding of physiochemical properties.

AB Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic organisms that inhabit diverse
   ecological habitats ranging from freshwater and brackish water to
   seawater and wastewater. They are also especially equipped to thrive in
   extreme temperatures and pH conditions. Decades of research have
   highlighted their potential as sources of biofuels, foods, feeds and
   high-value bio-actives. However, industrial-scale cultivation of
   microalgae is still not being carried out to its full potential. This
   review aims to shed light on the potential of microalgal-derived food,
   feed and fuel in developing countries and to what extent microalgae
   could be applied to sustainable development efforts with a special focus
   on Kenya. The Kenyan government has set out a development policy termed
   'Kenya Vision 2030' that aims to transform the nation into a newly
   industrialised country with a high quality of life for all its people by
   the year 2030. Here we show that, not only does Kenya lie in an optimal
   geographical region for microalgal cultivation, but that microalgae has
   the capability to fulfil some of the 'Kenya Vision 2030' goals.

AB Background The production of microalgal biofuels, despite their
   sustainable and renowned potential, is not yet cost-effective compared
   to current conventional fuel technologies. However, the biorefinery
   concept increases the prospects of microalgal biomass as an economically
   viable feedstock suitable for the co-production of multiple biofuels
   along with value-added chemicals. To integrate biofuels production
   within the framework of a microalgae biorefinery, it is not only
   necessary to exploit multi-product platforms, but also to identify
   optimal microalgal cultivation strategies maximising the microalgal
   metabolites from which biofuels are obtained: starch and lipids. Whilst
   nutrient limitation is widely known for increasing starch and lipid
   formation, this cultivation strategy can greatly reduce microalgal
   growth. This work presents an optimisation framework combining
   predictive modelling and experimental methodologies to effectively
   simulate and predict microalgal growth dynamics and identify optimal
   cultivation strategies. Results Microalgal cultivation strategies for
   maximised starch and lipid formation were successfully established by
   developing a multi-parametric kinetic model suitable for the prediction
   of mixotrophic microalgal growth dynamics co-limited by nitrogen and
   phosphorus. The model's high predictive capacity was experimentally
   validated against various datasets obtained from laboratory-scale
   cultures ofChlamydomonas reinhardtiiCCAP 11/32C subject to different
   initial nutrient regimes. The identified model-based optimal cultivation
   strategies were further validated experimentally and yielded significant
   increases in starch (+ 270%) and lipid (+ 74%) production against a
   non-optimised strategy. Conclusions The optimised microalgal cultivation
   scenarios for maximised starch and lipids, as identified by the kinetic
   model presented here, highlight the benefits of exploiting modelling
   frameworks as optimisation tools that facilitate the development and
   commercialisation of microalgae-to-fuel technologies.

AB Microalgae can continuously convert carbon dioxide into biofuels as a
   typical organism of biological carbon fixation. This study investigated
   the effects of exogenous putrescine on lipid accumulation, algal growth,
   and transcriptional metabolism ofTetradesmus obliquus. The results
   showed that the content of neutral lipids increased by 2.26-fold after
   short-term stress of putrescine, and the total lipids increased to
   355.51 mg/g. Furthermore, the transcriptomic analysis reveals that
   putrescine treatment plays a dramatic role in photosynthetic electron
   transport, carbon metabolism, and signal transduction pathways, and the
   purpose of lipid accumulation was achieved by influencing the changes in
   cell carbon flux and physiological functions. Altogether, this study
   demonstrates for the first time that putrescine treatment has a positive
   effect on lipid accumulation through unprecedented regulation of key
   metabolic nodes and provides theoretical support for the industrial
   biodiesel production of microalgae.

AB Photosynthesis is a process which converts light energy into energy
   contained in the chemical bonds of organic compounds by photosynthetic
   pigments such as chlorophyll (Chl a, b, c, d, f) or bacteriochlorophyll.
   It occurs in phototrophic organisms, which include higher plants and
   many types of photosynthetic bacteria, including cyanobacteria. In the
   case of the oxygenic photosynthesis, water is a donor of both electrons
   and protons, and solar radiation serves as inexhaustible source of
   energy. Efficiency of energy conversion in the primary processes of
   photosynthesis is close to 100%. Therefore, for many years
   photosynthesis has attracted the attention of researchers and designers
   looking for alternative energy systems as one of the most efficient and
   eco-friendly pathways of energy conversion. The latest advances in the
   design of optimal solar cells include the creation of converters based
   on thylakoid membranes, photosystems, and whole cells of cyanobacteria
   immobilized on nanostructured electrode (gold nanoparticles, carbon
   nanotubes, nanoparticles of ZnO and TiO2). The mode of solar energy
   conversion in photosynthesis has a great potential as a source of
   renewable energy while it is sustainable and environmentally safety as
   well. Application of pigments such as Chl f and Chl d (unlike Chl a and
   Chl b), by absorbing the far-red and near infrared region of the
   spectrum (in the range 700-750 nm), will allow to increase the
   efficiency of such light transforming systems. This review article
   presents the last achievements in the field of energy photoconverters
   based on photosynthetic systems.

AB BACKGROUND: Biodiesel is an alternative to conventional fossil diesel
   fuel. Currently, it is mainly produced from vegetable oils and
   consequently it has an adverse impact on food price. Lipids from
   oleaginous microorganisms (e.g. microalgae, bacteria, fungi and yeasts)
   could be an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production and therefore
   the growth and lipid accumulation of Trichosporon oleaginosus was
   studied under different conditions. RESULTS: The growth of T.
   oleaginosus on the xylose containing media enhanced the lipid
   accumulation and reduced cell growth, while on the glucose-containing
   media the opposite effect was observed. Trichosporon oleaginosus can
   accumulate above 50% of total lipids in dry cell mass during continuous
   and batch culture in the nitrogen-limited conditions. In the continuous
   culture relatively high productivity of total lipid accumulation (0.67 g
   dm-3 h-1) was observed on the glucose containing media. The type of
   substrate limitation has considerable impact on the fatty acid
   composition of yeast cell lipids. The predicted biodiesel properties
   (based on the fatty acids composition of lipids) were found to meet the
   CEN quality standards. CONCLUSION: The results obtained show that T.
   oleaginosus has great potential for feasible biodiesel production,
   especially when sugars from industrial and agricultural waste are used
   as a substrate.

AB Microalgae biofuel is expected to be an ideal alternative to fossil
   fuels to mitigate the effects of climate change and the energy crisis.
   However, the production process of microalgae biofuel is sometimes
   considered to be energy intensive and uneconomical, which limits its
   large-scale production. Several cultivation systems are used to acquire
   feedstock for microalgal biofuels production. The energy consumption of
   different cultivation systems is different, and the concentration of
   culture medium (microalgae cells contained in the unit volume of medium)
   and other properties of microalgae vary with the culture methods, which
   affects the energy consumption of subsequent processes. This review
   compared the energy consumption of different cultivation systems,
   including the open pond system, four types of closed photobioreactor
   (PBR) systems, and the hybrid cultivation system, and the energy
   consumption of the subsequent harvesting process. The biomass
   concentration and areal biomass production of every cultivation system
   were also analyzed. The results show that the flat-panel PBRs and the
   column PBRs are both preferred for large-scale biofuel production for
   high biomass productivity.

AB Chlorella sorokiniana(CS) is a prominent microalga with vast potential
   as a biocarrier for carbon mitigation toward a green process. However,
   challenges remain in achieving high biomass levels and production rates.
   Therefore, a systematic feeding strategy using 4-aminobutyric acid
   (GABA) and CRISPR technology was applied to improve microalgal
   productivity. At first, GABA increased protein content by 1.4-fold,
   while intermittent supplementation during cultivation resulted in a
   1.58-fold and 2.13-fold increase in biomass and pigment content,
   respectively. Under halophilic conditions, the optimal approach involved
   repeated feeding of 5 mM GABA at the initial and mid-log phases of
   growth, resulting in biomass, protein, and pigment levels of 6.74 g/L,
   3.24 g/L, and 49.87 mg/L. CRISPRa mediated glutamate synthase and using
   monosodium glutamate (MSG) as a cheap precursor for GABA has effectively
   enhanced the biomass, protein, and lutein content, thus offers a
   cost-effective approach to commercialize high-valued chemical using
   algae towards a low-carbon paradigm.

AB The impact of microalgae (including blue-green algae or cyanobacteria)
   on human life can be both beneficiary and deleterious. While microalgae
   can be cultivated and used as feedstocks for the production of bioenergy
   and high value-added products in nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and
   aquaculture feeds, some microalgae cause harmful algal blooms (HABs)
   that cause large-scale mortality in aquatic environments around the
   world. Thus, with the development of microalgal biotechnology and
   increasing concern about HABs, research on microscopic algae has
   increased significantly. However, this growth of academic research and
   application fields has been hindered by difficulties in obtaining axenic
   cultures. Therefore, this review provides a brief explanation of diverse
   establishment techniques, along with their strengths and weaknesses,
   with the hope of facilitating successful axenic cultures. A compilation
   of research fields and relevant important findings is also presented to
   clarify the importance of pure algal cultures. Finally, several
   controversial and sometimes overlooked issues related to the
   establishment, maintenance, and utilization of axenic cultures are
   discussed.

AB The freshwater alga Chlorella, a highly productive source of starch,
   might substitute for starch-rich terrestrial plants in bioethanol
   production. The cultivation conditions necessary for maximizing starch
   content in Chlorella biomass, generated in outdoor scale-up solar
   photobioreactors, are described. The most important factor that can
   affect the rate of starch synthesis, and its accumulation, is mean
   illumination resulting from a combination of biomass concentration and
   incident light intensity. While 8.5% DW of starch was attained at a mean
   light intensity of 215 mol/(m2s1), 40% of DW was synthesized at a mean
   light intensity 330 mol/(m2s1). Another important factor is the phase of
   the cell cycle. The content of starch was highest (45% of DW) prior to
   cell division, but during the course of division, its cellular level
   rapidly decreased to about 13% of DW in cells grown in light, or to
   about 4% in those kept in the dark during the division phase. To produce
   biomass with high starch content, it is necessary to suppress cell
   division events, but not to disturb synthesis of starch in the
   chloroplast. The addition of cycloheximide (1 mg/L), a specific
   inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, and the effect of element
   limitation (nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus) were tested. The majority of
   the experiments were carried out in laboratory-scale photobioreactors,
   where culture treatments increased starch content to up to about 60% of
   DW in the case of cycloheximide inhibition or sulfur limitation. When
   the cells were limited by phosphorus or nitrogen supply, the cellular
   starch content increased to 55% or 38% of DW, respectively, however,
   after about 20 h, growth of the cultures stopped producing starch, and
   the content of starch again decreased. Sulfur limited and
   cycloheximide-treated cells maintained a high content of starch (60% of
   DW) for up to 2 days. Sulfur limitation, the most appropriate treatment
   for scaled-up culture of starch-enriched biomass, was carried out in an
   outdoor pilot-scale experiment. After 120 h of growth in complete
   mineral medium, during which time the starch content reached around 18%
   of DW, sulfur limitation increased the starch content to 50% of DW.

AB In the present study, the marine microalga Tisochrysis lutea was
   cultivated mixotrophically in F2 growth medium with sodium acetate as
   exogenous carbon source. The medium was composed of different
   concentrations of nitrogen to determine the impact of nitrogen depletion
   on cellular growth and chemical composition. Nitrogen depletion led to
   severely decreased growth and protein content. However, mild nitrogen
   depletion (0.22 mM NaNO3) led to maximum lipid yield. The fatty acid
   methyl ester profile also showed increased unsaturation as the nitrogen
   content decreased. Growth in nitrogen-free medium increased the
   proportions of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, while the
   proportion of saturated fatty acids decreased. Growth under all tested
   nitrogen levels showed undetectable fatty acids with ≥4 double bonds,
   indicating these fatty acids had oxidative stability. In addition, all
   tested nitrogen concentrations led to specific gravity, kinematic
   viscosity, iodine value, and cetane number that meet the standards for
   Europe and the U.S.A. However, growth in the presence of nitrogen
   deficiency enhanced the higher heating value of the resulting biodiesel,
   a clear advantage from the perspective of energy efficiency. Thus,
   mixotrophic cultivation of T. lutea with nitrogen limitation provides a
   promising approach to achieve high lipid productivity and production of
   high-quality biodiesel.

U1 9
U2 29
AB This comprehensive study unveils the vast global potential of microalgae
   as a sustainable bioenergy source, focusing on the utilization of
   marginal lands and employing advanced machine learning techniques to
   predict biomass productivity. By identifying approximately 7.37 million
   square kilometers of marginal lands suitable for microalgae cultivation,
   this research uncovers the extensive potential of these underutilized
   areas, particularly within equatorial and low-latitude regions, for
   microalgae bioenergy development. This approach mitigates the
   competition for food resources and conserves freshwater supplies.
   Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms based on robust
   datasets from global microalgae cultivation experiments spanning 1994 to
   2017, this study integrates essential environmental variables to map out
   a detailed projection of potential yields across a variety of
   landscapes. The analysis further delineates the bioenergy and carbon
   sequestration potential across two effective cultivation methods:
   Photobioreactors (PBRs), and Open Ponds, with PBRs showcasing
   exceptional productivity, with a global average daily biomass
   productivity of 142.81 mg L-1 d-1, followed by Open Ponds at 122.57 mg
   L-1 d-1 . Projections based on optimal PBR conditions suggest an annual
   yield of 99.54 gigatons of microalgae biomass. This yield can be
   transformed into 64.70 gigatons of biodiesel, equivalent to 58.68
   gigatons of traditional diesel, while sequestering 182.16 gigatons of
   CO2, equating to approximately 4.5 times the global CO2 emissions
   projected for 2023. Notably, Australia leads in microalgae biomass
   production, with an annual output of 16.19 gigatons, followed by
   significant contributions from Kazakhstan, Sudan, Brazil, the United
   States, and China, showcasing the diverse global potential for
   microalgae bioenergy across varying ecological and geographical
   landscapes. Through this rigorous investigation, the study emphasizes
   the strategic importance of microalgae cultivation in achieving
   sustainable energy solutions and mitigating climate change, while also
   acknowledging the scalability challenges and the necessity for
   significant economic and energy investments.

U2 86
AB The potential of microalgae biomass as a feedstock for bioethanol
   fermentation has been widely considered in recent years. Yet, to date,
   only a modest level of research has been reported in this area. In all
   likelihood, the generation of a sustainable, sufficient level of biomass
   for biofuel production will need to be undertaken in saline water, and
   potentially under hypersaline conditions, to circumvent reliance on
   fresh water. However, the processing challenges associated with the
   fermentation of hypersaline biomass have yet to be adequately addressed.
   This review examines developments thus far for producing bioethanol from
   microalgae, indicating alternative means by which hypersaline microalgal
   biomass may be utilised, and provides a framework in which the
   industrial potential for sourcing such biomass should be considered.

AB This paper presents the effects of various phosphorus concentrations
   (10, 50, 250 and 500 mg l-1K2HPO4) on the biomass production and
   composition ofArthrospira(Spirulina)platensisin relation to light
   intensity (24, 42 and 60 E m-2s-1). The maximum biomass production was
   3,592392 mg l-1and this was observed in 250 mg l-1K2HPO4at 60 E
   m-2s-1light intensity after 32 days of cultivation. A maximum specific
   growth rate (max) of 0.55 d-1was obtained in 500 mg l-1K2HPO4at 60 E
   m-2s-1. The protein, lipid and chlorophyll contents of the biomass
   varied from 33.59 to 60.57%, 5.34 to 13.33% and 0.78 to 2.00%,
   respectively. The most significant finding was that phosphorus
   limitation (10 mg l-1K2HPO4) caused a drastic increase of the
   carbohydrate content (59.64%). The effect of phosphorus limitation on
   the carbohydrate content was independent of the light intensity. The
   accumulated carbohydrates are proposed to be used as substrate for
   biofuel generation via one of the appropriate biomass energy conversion
   technologies. Also, it was observed that phosphorus removal is a
   function of biomass density, phosphorus concentration and light
   intensity.

AB Microalgae have garnered significant interest among researchers and
   industries as a potential source of valuable products that can find
   applications in the food, feed, biofuels, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals,
   and nutraceuticals industries. Microalgae can remediate various waste
   streams. This review discusses the current trends in the valorization of
   algal biomass and proposes integrated biorefinery approaches to produce
   high-value products by sustainable routes. In such processes, the waste
   streams can be used as a source of nutrients for the production of
   microalgal biomass, rich in high-quality lipids, digestible proteins and
   bioactive compounds. The integrated approaches presented in this study
   offer cost-effective and environment-friendly processing techniques
   while expanding the bioproducts portfolio in the food and therapeutics
   sector. The simultaneous or sequential extraction of valuable compounds
   from microalgae makes the biorefinery proposition appealing for waste
   minimization, revenue diversification, and complete feedstock
   utilization. The systematic exploration of microalgae on a large scale
   is required to evaluate its future as a favorable resource for
   biorefinery products. This would also necessitate detailed
   techno-economic, environmental, and lifecycle assessment for the
   biorefinery processes.

   forefront of production of liquid fuels from microalgae produced in
   'closed' photobioreactors and fermenters: Algae.Tec, Algenol Biofuel,
   Heliae, Solazyme and Solix. All the five companies in the review have
   developed novel closed production systems, each with unique technology
   partners, capabilities and commercial strategies. Advantages of reactors
   include higher volumetric productivity and reduced contamination risks.
   Conversely, the largest challenges for reactors are minimising capital
   and production costs, in addition to attracting initial investment
   capital for non-conventional complex technical systems. This review
   provides a concise summary of each company's technology, background, and
   where available, a qualified assessment of the productivity and
   economics of their systems. This review demonstrates that commercially
   viable production systems will need to achieve sustained volumetric
   productivity to reduce per unit costs, and industry cross-collaboration
   will be essential for closed system technology developments to
   successfully produce cost-competitive fuels.

U1 0
U2 27
AB Oxygen (O2) is a strong inhibitor of hydrogenase (HydA) activity and
   expression and altering the sulfur (S) oxidizing transitions in
   photosystem II (PSII) often allows algal photohydrogen production;
   however, this may not be practical in a wastewater environment. To
   counteract natural mechanisms of oxygen evolution in PSII, we utilized
   acetic acid and butyric acid, which are main volatile fatty acids (VFAs)
   found in anaerobic bacterial digestion in wastewater treatment, as
   oxygen regulators for photosynthetic biohydrogen production using
   Chlorella vulgaris. It was found that a VFA-containing synthetic
   wastewater promotes oxygen depletion in a photobioreactor (PBR),
   producing maximum hydrogen yield of 65.40.3 moL H2 L-1 mM-1 acetate
   without artificial sulfur or chloride deprivation. Butyric acids showed
   no significant effect on oxygen depletion and biohydrogen production in
   the PBR. The measurements of both relative expression level of mRNA and
   specific activities of reactivate HydA revealed that repetitive algal H2
   photo-evolution was possible by HydA synthesis in C. vulgaris followed
   by complete oxygen depletion controlled by acetic acid levels in the
   PBR. This emerging understanding of the role of VFAs on oxygen
   regulation in PSII in natural environments is expected to lead
   algal-driven bioenergy production technologies to the next level.

   source of industrial resources. The review included, inter alia, the
   potential for use of these organisms in the cosmetics and medical
   industries, including the most important ingredients that make them a
   valuable food product. It also noted their growing popularity and
   potential future use, e.g. as biofuels, natural fertilizers or
   components of sewage treatment plants. The possibility of using
   macroalgae as a biological factor limiting the occurrence of mass blooms
   of cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea is also presented.

AB Algal biofuel has been advocated as a sustainable and environmentally
   friendly renewable energy source. However, intensive chemical usage,
   high energy consumption, and high operation and maintenance costs
   associated with current cell disruption methods have been identified as
   main challenges to cost-effective production of algal biofuel. Viral
   infection of algae is a natural process that can lyse algal cells under
   ambient conditions without using chemicals or energy-intensive
   equipment. This study, for the first time, provides a comprehensive and
   in-depth evaluation of the feasibility of using viruses to assist algal
   lipid extraction. Detailed mechanistic studies were conducted to
   evaluate the impact on mechanical strength of algal cell walls, lipid
   yield, and lipid distribution when Chlorella sp. were infected by
   Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1). Viral disruption with
   multiplicity of infection of 10-8 was able to disrupt concentrated algal
   biomass completely in six days. Our results indicated that viral
   disruption significantly reduced the mechanical strength of algal cells.
   Lipid yield with viral disruption increased more than three times
   compared to no disruption controls and was similar to that of ultrasonic
   disruption. Moreover, lipid composition analysis showed that the quality
   of extracted lipids was not affected by viral infection. The results
   showed that viral infection is a highly cost-effective technique to
   promote lipid extraction without extensive energy input and chemicals
   required by existing disruption methods. The results of this study
   provided new insights in the development of nature-inspired lipid
   extraction methods for cost-efficient biofuel production.

AB In spite of attractive attributes, diatoms are underrepresented in
   research and literature related to the development of microalgal
   biofuels. Diatoms are highly diverse and have substantial
   evolutionarily-based differences in cellular organization and metabolic
   processes relative to chlorophytes. Diatoms have tremendous ecological
   success, with typically higher productivity than other algal classes,
   which may relate to cellular factors discussed in this review. Diatoms
   can accumulate lipid equivalently or to a greater extent than other
   algal classes, and can rapidly induce triacylglycerol under Si
   limitation, avoiding the detrimental effects on photosynthesis, gene
   expression and protein content associated with N limitation. Diatoms
   have been grown on production scales for aquaculture for decades,
   produce value-added products and are amenable to omic and genetic
   manipulation approaches. In this article, we highlight beneficial
   attributes and address potential concerns of diatoms as biofuels
   research and production organisms, and encourage a greater emphasis on
   their development in the biofuels arena.

AB Microalgal biomass can be converted to biofuels to replace
   nonsustainable fossil fuels, but the widespread use of microalgal
   biofuels remains hampered by the high energetic and monetary costs
   related to carbon dioxide supply and downstream processing. Growing
   microalgae in mixed culture biofilms reduces energy demands for mixing,
   maintaining axenic conditions, and biomass concentration. Furthermore,
   maintaining a high pH improves carbon dioxide absorption rates and
   inorganic carbon solubility, thus overcoming the carbon limitation and
   increasing the volumetric productivity of the microalgal biomass.
   Digesting the microalgal biomass anaerobically at high pH results in
   biogas that is enriched in methane, while the dissolved carbon dioxide
   is recycled to the phototrophic reactor. All of the required
   haloalkaline conversions are known in nature.

AB In recent years the increasing demand for food, energy, and valuable

   and sustainable sources. Microalgae represent a promising option to
   produce various products with environmentally friendly applications.
   However, several challenges must be overcome to reduce production cost.
   To this end, using effluents from biogas production units, called
   digestates, in cultivation systems can help to optimize bioprocesses,
   and several bioproducts including biofuels, biofertilizers, proteins and
   valuable chemicals can be obtained. Nevertheless, several parameters,
   including the productivity and quality of biomass and specific target
   products, downstream processes, and cost-effectiveness, must be
   improved. Further investigations will be necessary to take full
   advantage of the produced biomass and effectively upscale the process.

AB Microalgae-based wastewater management has the potential to serve dual
   purposes, including biofuel production and wastewater bioremediation.
   The current study investigates the role of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)
   in the regulation of photosynthesis, biomass accumulation, lipid
   production, and nutrient removal from wastewater by Chlorella
   pyrenoidosa. In wastewaters, a 3 muM concentration of 5-ALA was
   considered optimal, as it increased the photosynthetic light reaction
   and CO2 assimilation of C. pyrenoidosa cells, thereby facilitating
   cellular growth, metabolism, and biomass accumulation. The acceleration
   of algal cellular metabolism increased the substrate pool and enhanced
   the expression of lipogenic genes, thereby promoting lipid production.
   Meanwhile, the removal of nutrients from wastewater was accelerated
   after the addition of 5-ALA. The accelerated nutrient removal from
   wastewaters following 5-ALA treatment was related to C. pyrenoidosa cell
   growth. C. pyrenoidosa is capable of utilizing nitrogen and phosphorus
   from wastewater and accumulating biomass. The biomass from microalgae
   can be used as a feedstock to produce biofuels. Therefore, the current
   study provided a novel strategy for simultaneously promoting CO2
   assimilation, biomass accumulation, lipid production, and wastewater
   nutrient removal with microalgae. It is possible to use microalgae for
   the management of wastewater if research and development on
   commercializing technologies based on microalgae, both upstream and
   downstream, are carried out continuously.

AB Although microalgae are considered as a promising feedstock for
   biofuels, the energy efficiency of the production process needs to be
   significantly improved. Due to their small size and low concentration in
   the culture medium, cost-efficient harvesting of microalgae is a major
   challenge. In this study, the use of electro-coagulation-flocculation
   (ECF) as a method for harvesting a freshwater (Chlorella vulgaris) and a
   marine (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) microalgal species is evaluated. ECF
   was shown to be more efficient using an aluminum anode than using an
   iron anode. Furthermore, it could be concluded that the efficiency of
   the ECF process can be substantially improved by reducing the initial pH
   and by increasing the turbulence in the microalgal suspension. Although
   higher current densities resulted in a more rapid flocculation of the
   microalgal suspension, power consumption, expressed per kg of microalgae
   harvested, and release of aluminum were lower when a lower current
   density was used. The aluminum content of the harvested microalgal
   biomass was less than 1% while the aluminum concentration in the process
   water was below 2 mg L-1. Under optimal conditions, power consumption of
   the ECF process was around 2 kWh kg-1of microalgal biomass harvested
   forChlorella vulgarisand ca. 0.3 kWh kg-1forPhaeodactylum tricornutum.
   Compared to centrifugation, ECF is thus more energy efficient. Because
   of the lower power consumption of ECF in seawater, ECF is a particularly
   attractive method for harvesting marine microalgae.

AB Upgrading biogas offers interchangeability with natural gas, plus the
   benefits of converting waste into energy to help address climate change.
   However, only 5% of the biogas produced worldwide is purified to
   biomethane and injected into the gas grid or used as a transport fuel.
   Using a Technology Roadmapping approach, this study aims to identify
   technology trends, key players, and critical factors to broader the
   production and application of biomethane. Data included 53 companies'
   websites, 194 granted patents, 177 patents applied for, and 225
   articles, correlating them to different timeframes. We classify the
   gathered information into taxonomies, which outlines the sector's global
   trends and gaps over time. Our findings have direct implications for
   guiding R&D management and strategic planning. Overall, we found that
   hybrid processes, mainly membranes combined with pressure swing
   adsorption and absorption with membrane contactor, and cryogenic
   separation are tendencies for short and medium-term development focus.
   Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage, and biological upgrading
   processes, especially microalgae-based, have had a great academic
   interest and are long-term trends, present in 32% and 20% of the
   articles, respectively. Biogas upgrading technologies are at a high
   maturity level with more prominent activity in optimisation and hybrid
   technologies. There is room for materials improvement and breakthroughs
   in second-generation technologies, such as biological methanation and
   Power-to-Gas, by converting carbon dioxide instead of its separation.
   Finally, to ensure biomethane sustainability and competitiveness, energy
   & environmental efficiencies and cost reduction are critical factors for
   R&D, which has prioritised gas purity, yield, and recovery.

   PO4-P removed were 33.331, 37.227 and 1.323 mg/L. Biomass production
   ofDesmodesmussp. was also enhanced in fed-batch cultivation, when ADW
   loading was carried out every 2 days; the biomass concentration peaked
   at 1.039 g/L, which was three times higher than that obtained in batch
   cultivation (0.385 g/L). The highest lipid production (261.8 mg/L) was
   also recorded in fed-batch cultivation as compared to batch cultivation
   (83.3 mg/L). Fed-batch cultivation ofDesmodesmussp. could provide
   effective control of nutrients limitation and/or ammonia inhibition on

AB Coupling algae growth on wastewater with hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)
   is regarded as an environment-enhancing pathway for wastewater
   management, biomass amplification, sustainable energy generation and
   value-added products generation. Through this integrated pathway,
   microalgae can not only recover nitrogen and phosphorus, but also absorb
   heavy metals from the wastewater. The migration and transformation of
   heavy metals need to be specifically assessed and considered due to the
   environmental concerns associated with metal toxicity. This work
   reviewed recent advances with respect to bioremediation mechanisms.
   Particular emphasis was placed on the heavy metal migration,
   transformation, and the key factors involved in algal wastewater
   treatment and biomass conversion. Additionally, the challenges of
   coupling algae wastewater treatment, hydrothermal conversion, and heavy

AB Previous assessments of the economic feasibility and large-scale

   land and carbon dioxide (CO2) availability on the scalability of
   microalgae-based biofuels production. To accurately assess the near-term
   productivity potential of large-scale microalgae biofuel in the USA, a
   geographically realized growth model was used to simulate microalgae
   lipid yields based on meteorological data. The resulting lipid
   productivity potential ofNannochloropsisunder large-scale cultivation is
   combined with land and CO2resource availability illustrating current
   geographically feasible production sites and corresponding productivity
   in the USA. Baseline results show that CO2transport constraints will
   limit US microalgae-based bio-oil production to 4% of the 2030
   Department of Energy (DOE) alternative fuel goal. The discussion focuses
   on synthesis of this large-scale productivity potential results
   including a sensitivity analysis to land and CO2resource assumptions, an
   evaluation of previous modeling efforts, and their assumptions regarding
   the transportation of CO2, the feasibility of microalgae to meet DOE

AB Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, represents both a challenge and an
   opportunity in the quest for sustainable energy. This work investigates
   the biotechnology for converting methane into clean, renewable hydrogen.
   The co-culture of Chlorella sacchrarophila FACHB 4 and Methylomonas sp.
   HYX-M1 was demonstrated to completely convert 1 mmol of methane to
   biomass within 96 h. After acid digestion of such biomass, up to 45.05
   mumol of glucose, 4.07 mumol of xylose, and 26.5 mumol of lactic acid
   were obtained. Both Clostridium pasteurianum DSM525 and Clostridium sp.
   BZ-1 can utilize those sugars to produce hydrogen without any additional
   organic carbon sources. The higher light intensity in methane oxidation
   co-culture systems resulted in higher hydrogen production, with the BZ-1
   strain producing up to 14.00 mumol of hydrogen, 8.19 mumol of lactate,
   and 6.09 mumol of butyrate from the co-culture biomass obtained at
   12,000 lux. The results demonstrate that the co-culture biomass of
   microalgae and methanotroph has the potential to serve as a feedstock
   for dark fermentative hydrogen production. Our study highlights the
   complexities inherent in achieving efficient and complete
   methane-to-hydrogen conversion, positioning this biological approach as
   a pivotal yet demanding area of research for combating climate change
   and propelling the global energy transition.

AB Research on marine microalgae has been abundantly published and patented
   these last years leading to the production and/or the characterization
   of some biomolecules such as pigments, proteins, enzymes, biofuels,
   polyunsaturated fatty acids, enzymes and hydrocolloids . This literature
   focusing on metabolic pathways, structural characterization of
   biomolecules, taxonomy, optimization of culture conditions, biorefinery
   and downstream process is often optimistic considering the valorization
   of these biocompounds. However, the accumulation of knowledge associated
   with the development of processes and technologies for biomass
   production and its treatment has sometimes led to success in the
   commercial arena. In the history of the microalgae market, red marine
   microalgae are well positioned particularly for applications in the
   field of high value pigment and hydrocolloid productions. This review
   aims to establish the state of the art of the diversity of red marine
   microalgae, the advances in characterization of their metabolites and
   the developments of bioprocesses to produce this biomass.

AB Microalgae have significant potential to be an important alternative
   energy source, but the challenges to the commercialization of bio-oil
   from microalgae need to be overcome for the potential to be realized.
   The application of stress can be used to improve bio-oil yields from
   algae. Nevertheless, the understanding of stress effects is fragmented
   due to the lack of a suitable, direct quantitative marker for stress.
   The lack of understanding seems to have limited the development of
   stress based strategies to improve bio-oil yields, and hence the
   commercialization of microalgae-based bio-oil. In this study, we have
   proposed and used the specific intracellular reactive species levels
   (siROS) particularly hydroxyl and superoxide radical levels, separately,
   as direct, quantitative, markers for stress, irrespective of the type of
   stress induced. Although ROS reactions are extremely rapid, the siROS
   level can be assumed to be at pseudo-steady state compared to the time
   scales of metabolism, growth and production, and hence they can be
   effective stress markers at particular time points. Also, the specific
   intracellular (si-) hydroxyl and superoxide radical levels are easy to
   measure through fluorimetry. Interestingly, irrespective of the
   conditions employed in this study, that is, nutrient excess/limitation
   or different light wavelengths, the cell concentrations are correlated
   to the siROS levels in an inverse power law fashion. The composite plots
   of cell concentration (y) and siROS (x) yielded the correlations of y=k1
   . x-0.7 and y=k2 . x-0.79, for si-hydroxyl and si-superoxide radical
   levels, respectively. The specific intracellular (si-) neutral lipid
   levels, which determine the bio-oil productivity, are related in a
   direct power law fashion to the specific hydroxyl radical levels. The
   composite plot of si-neutral lipid levels (z) and si-hydroxyl radical
   level (x) yielded a correlation of z=k3 . x0.65. More interestingly, a
   nutrient shift caused a significant change in the sensitivity of neutral
   lipid accumulation to the si-hydroxyl radical levels.

AB The low cost cultivation mode of Ankistudesmus sp. was discussed in this
   study. The effect of nitrogen, carbon and reactor pattern on biomass,
   fat accumulation and fat composition were investigated. Lipid production
   got higher when in nitrogen starvation cultured outside. Through the
   comparison between slot reactor and tubular reactor. It discovered that
   slot reactor is more suitable for large scale microalgae cultivation.
   Mixotrophic cultivation could significantly improve algal biomass and
   lipid content, under the optimal addition conditions, biomass and lipid
   content were up to 1.41 g/L and 11.9%, 1.64 g/L and 15.9% respectively.
   Algal lipid were made into biodiesel through acidic catalysis and methyl
   esterification. The main contents of algal lipid were palmitic acid,
   oleic acid and linoleic acid. Furthermore, the obtained algal oil in
   conditions of nitrogen limitation and adding glucose had 25.32% palmitic
   acid and 44.74% oleic acid which could provide better oxidative
   stability and cold flow properties.

   isolated from the Nile water in Upper Egypt. These microalgae were
   exposed to nutritional (nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron) limitations and
   salinity stress to study their effects on the algal growth and to
   elevate the lipid content within their cells. The results indicated that
   exposure to these conditions had a significant impact on the algal
   growth. The lipid content of the studied algae increased as a result of
   the salinity stress. The highest lipid content was recorded inA.
   brauniiculture treated with 50 mM NaCl (34.4% of dry weight) andS.
   incrassatuluscultures treated with 100 mM NaCl (37.7% of dry weight) on
   the 6th day of cultivation, while the culture ofA. falcatustreated with
   100 mM NaCl recorded the maximum lipid content (53% of dry weight) on
   the 10th day of the experiment. The biodiesel quality parameters of the
   fatty acid methyl ester profile ofS. incrassatulusappeared to be in
   agreement with the international criteria.S. incrassatuluscould be
   regarded as a quite promising feedstock for the biodiesel production.

   revolutionary innovation solution. Identifying opportunities in the next
   wave of technologies for Biopharma, along with other policy initiatives
   including financial crisis actions and climate policy, will affect on
   manufacturing biopharmaceutical products today and in the future in cost
   effective manner, and will be our adequate answer addressing to global
   geopolitical, economic and climate changes. It also underscores the
   search for new approach, evidenced by trends around new formulations to
   serve lower income patients. Microalgae biomass comes in many strains,
   and can be used by means of variety product developments. In the last
   years the key task of our R & D was to find a solution for these tasks.
   The biofuel market development dynamics include significant opportunity
   of microalgae raw material and microalgae processing biomass rest of
   biodiesel manufacturing for Biopharma global growth in cost effective
   manner. Second new source of microalgae raw material for Biopharma
   include microalgae production through waste and wastewater cleaning.
   This should provide the opportunity to see the future in a new vision,
   where technology can serve as a revelation of the truth and where every
   endeavor is governed by reflection on and appreciation of the
   environment and thus leading to resolution of global tasks facing the
   world community and inclusion of microalgae in production and bio cycles
   open new cost effective ways for Biopharma companies and conservation of
   nature. A truly coherent microalgae raw material and Biopharma
   production policy has to find ways to bring these two traces closer for
   cost effective manufacturing, well being Biopharma economy and human
   health.

AB Algae is a potent renewable source with the favorable characteristics.
   However, there are still many barriers in the related theory, techniques
   and industrialization, which lead to the high cost of the algae biofuel.
   This paper reviewed the process of the microalgae biofuel's commercial
   process. Investigated the barriers of the technologies especially the
   energy-extensive part and the pilot scale test which is the crucial part
   of the process. The policy supports of American, EU and China for
   microalgae biofuel industry and the effect of them was summarized at
   this paper. Numbers of pilot scale program has launched in the support
   of the government and the private investment, while there is still some
   distance from scale up production. Algae fundamental biology research,
   co-products' production to make profits in short term, and support from
   government are key strategies of algae commercialization.

AB When properly designed, pretreatments may enhance the methane potential
   and/or anaerobic digestion rate, improving digester performance. This
   paper aims at providing some guidelines on the most appropriate
   pretreatments for the main feedstocks of biogas plants. Waste activated
   sludge was firstly investigated and implemented at full-scale, its
   thermal pretreatment with steam explosion being most recommended as it
   increases the methane potential and digestion rate, ensures sludge
   sanitation and the heat needed is produced on-site. Regarding fatty
   residues, saponification is preferred for enhancing their solubilisation
   and bioavailability. In the case of animal by-products, this
   pretreatment can be optimised to ensure sterilisation, solubilisation
   and to reduce inhibition linked to long chain fatty acids. With regards
   to lignocellulosic biomass, the first goal should be delignification,
   followed by hemicellulose and cellulose hydrolysis, alkali or biological
   (fungi) pretreatments being most promising. As far as microalgae are
   concerned, thermal pretreatment seems the most promising technique so
   far.

AB Utilizing industrial off-gas CO2in open system photosynthetic microalgae
   cultivation is a biological means to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
   The captured CO2can also enhance production of microalgal lipids for
   conversion into biodiesel. However, environmental stressors such as
   temperature, pH, luminosity, salinity, metal toxicity, nutrient
   availability, and shear stress can impact the CO2fixation process and
   lipid biosynthesis. We discuss the mechanisms of carbon fixation and
   lipid synthesis in microalgal cells, commercial microalgae cultivation
   systems, and the limitations and potentials of utilizing industrial
   off-gases. The influences of operational and environmental factors on
   CO2sequestration rates and lipid production, as well as manipulative
   approaches for enhanced lipid production are also reviewed.

U2 28
AB Developing an economical algae harvesting system still remains a
   challenge today. One of the strategies to decrease harvesting costs
   prior conversion is employing technologies that can have additional
   benefits apart of separation. In this work we explore ozoflotation as a
   technique to recover microalgae grown in treated wastewater and we
   evaluate the effect of ozone on lipid and FAME recoveries. A high
   percentage of biomass can be harvested (79.6% as TSS) when using an
   ozone dose of 0.23 mg/mg of dried biomass. Additionally, two interesting
   effects of ozone were found in this study. The amount of lipid extracted
   and FAME recovered from the biomass, at least, doubles when using
   ozoflotation (with ozone doses of 0.12-0.23 mg/mg of dried biomass) than
   when using centrifugation. And, the oxidative stability of biodiesel can
   be enhanced by the effect that ozone has in the degree of FAME
   saturation.

U2 28
AB The tremendous increase in human population and rapid decline in
   freshwater resources have necessitated the development of innovative and
   sustainable wastewater treatment methods. Africa as a developing
   continent is currently backing on sustainable solutions to tackle
   impending water resource crisis brought forward by wastewater-induced
   environmental pollution and climate change. Microalgae-based wastewater
   treatment systems represent an emerging technology that is capable of
   meeting the new demand for improved wastewater treatment and climate
   change mitigation strategies in an environmentally friendly manner. This
   review critically looks at the opportunities of Africa in harnessing and
   exploiting the potential of microalgae for the treatment of various
   wastewaters based on their capacity to recycle nutrients and for
   concurrent production of valuable biomass and several useful
   metabolites. Wastewaters, if improperly/completely untreated and
   discharged, simultaneously pollute freshwater sources and present
   significant health and environmental risks. Nutrients in wastewater can
   be utilized and recovered in the form of marketable biomass and products
   when integrated with the cultivation of microalgae. Several valuable
   bioproducts can be generated from wastewater-grown microalgal biomass
   including biofuels, biofertilizers, animal feed, and various bioactive
   compounds. This biorefinery approach would most certainly improve
   wastewater treatment process economics, enhancing the technical
   feasibility of algae-based wastewater remediation in African countries.

AB Biodiesel production from microalgae is a promising approach for energy
   production; however, high cost of its process limits the use of
   microalgal biodiesel. Increasing the levels of triacylglycerol (TAG)
   levels, which is used as a biodiesel feedstock, in microalgae has been
   achieved mainly by nitrogen starvation. In this study, we compared
   effects of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) starvation on TAG accumulation
   and related parameters in wild-typeChlamydomonas reinhardtiiCC-124 mt(-)
   and CC-125 mt(+) strains. Cell division was interrupted, protein and
   chlorophyll levels rapidly declined while cell volume, total neutral
   lipid, carotenoid, and carbohydrate content increased in response to
   nutrient starvation. Cytosolic lipid droplets in microalgae under
   nutrient starvation were monitored by three-dimensional confocal laser
   imaging of live cells. Infrared spectroscopy results showed that
   relative TAG, oligosaccharide and polysaccharide levels increased
   rapidly in response to nutrient starvation, especially S starvation.
   Both strains exhibited similar levels of regulation responses under
   mineral deficiency, however, the degree of their responses were
   significantly different, which emphasizes the importance of mating type
   on the physiological response of algae. Neutral lipid, TAG, and
   carbohydrate levels reached their peak values following 4 days of N or S
   starvation. Therefore, 4 days of N or S starvation provides an excellent
   way of increasing TAG content. Although increase in these parameters was
   followed by a subsequent decline in N-starved strains after 4 days, this
   decline was not observed in S-starved ones, which shows that S
   starvation is a better way of increasing TAG production ofC.
   reinhardtiithan N starvation.

AB Algal biodiesel has been a subject of growing importance in the realm of
   renewable energy due to carbon capture properties and its potential for
   photosynthetic efficiency with high lipid output. This study identified
   five isolates of freshwater green algae, belonging to the Chlorellaceae,
   and measured the lipid classes and fatty acid profiles of these species
   to determine suitability for biodiesel production. To induce the greater
   accumulation of lipids, especially in the form of triacylglycerols
   (TAGs) desired for biodiesel, we examined the lipid accumulation in
   cells stressed by nitrogen limitation, sulfur deficiency, or pH stress.
   Increases in biomass were monitored in order to determine if adjusting
   pH incrementally over the course of the experiment had any effect on
   growth and lipid accumulation of several isolates. TAG accumulation was
   visually screened by Nile Red fluorescence and further assessed by gas
   chromatography. Lipid amounts were comparably equal or better for pH
   stress treatments than for standard nutrient-deprivation treatments.
   Incrementally adjusted pH over the course of growth triggered lipid
   accumulation comparable to constant pH stress treatments, yet biomass
   accumulation was equivalent to unstressed growth. One isolate obtained
   from the Athabasca oil-sands region of Alberta, OS4-2, is a good
   candidate for biodiesel production, having accumulated over 45% of its
   dry weight as lipid, with over 80% of the lipid as triacylglycerols, and
   contains an abundance of 18:1 fatty acids. This class of fatty acids
   improves the cold flow and oxidative stability of biodiesel and is ideal
   for biofuel used in a Canadian climate.

AB The conversion of multi-bioconstituents of microalgal biomass such as
   carbohydrates and proteins to lipids can substantially reduce the
   downstream and overall process cost, as the bioprocessing can be aimed
   at single-desired biofuel product, e.g., biodiesel. The present study
   developed an integrated process to enhance the lipid yield through
   oleaginous yeast fermentation of microalgal biomass, and
   cost-effectively extract the lipids through permeable and switchable
   ionic liquid (IL). A 60 g/L of microalgal (Chlamydomonas mexicana)
   biomass was pretreated via microwave which showed 37% cell disruption
   efficiency. The pretreated biomass was fermented using an oleaginous
   yeast,L. starkeyiwhich effectively consumed the carbohydrates (92%) and
   proteins (91%) ofC. mexicanaand converted it to excessive lipids (188%)
   in comparison to the original microalgal lipids (12.6 g/L) before
   fermentation. The ionic liquid (IL), Dissopropanolamine-Im was used for
   high-thoughput disruption of the biomass and extraction of total lipids.
   It significantly improved cell disruption efficiency (95%) and lipid
   extraction efficiency (99%) than the conventional (Bligh & Dyer) lipid
   extraction method (87%) and previously reported methods using several
   ionic liquids (~92%), and required a relatively shorter process time.
   More than 93% of IL could be recovored from the solution, and its
   recyclability was tested for >5 times where it could maintain an
   efficiency of >80% after five cycles. The integration of microalgal
   biomass andL. starkeyimediated fermentation improved the overall lipid
   production (23.72 g/L) and yielded 2.2 times higher biodiesel than the
   conventional process. The outcomes of this study provides a economic and
   sustainable model to overcome the existing limitations of biodiesel
   production from microalgal biomass.

   their roles in inorganic and organic pollutant removal and enhancement
   of microalgae growth. Limited studies have been conducted to establish
   nanomaterial's (CeO2, ZnO, Fe3O4, Al2O3, etc.) role on microalgae in
   pollution remediation; most studies cover inorganic pollutants (heavy
   metals and nutrients) remediation, exhibited 50-300% bioremediation
   efficiency improvement; however, some studies cover antibiotics and
   toxic dyes removal efficiency with 19-95% improvement. These aspects
   unveil the complex mechanisms underlying
   nanomaterial-pollutant-microalgae interactions, focusing on adsorption,
   photocatalysis, and quantum dot properties. Strategies to enhance
   bioremediation efficiency are discussed, including pollutant uptake
   improvement, real-time control, tailored nanomaterial design, and
   nutrient recovery. The review assesses recent advancements, navigates
   challenges, and envisions a sustainable future for bioremediation,
   underlining the transformative capacity of nanomaterial-driven
   microalgae-assisted bioremediation. This work aligns with Sustainable
   Development Goals 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and 12 (Responsible
   Consumption and Production) by exploring nanomaterial-enhanced
   microalgae bioremediation for sustainable pollution management and
   resource utilization.

TI Treatment updates of microalgae biomass for bioethanol production: a
   comparative study.
SO Journal of Cleaner Production
VL 383
PY 2023
U1 11
U2 77
AB Microalgae is a third-generation biomass source that can potentially be
   used as a raw material for bioethanol production. Microalgae is a viable
   alternative energy source to substitute or complement fossil fuels based
   on the disadvantages related to first- and second-generation biofuels.
   Bioethanol from microalgae sources does not compete with food needs. In
   addition, third-generation biomass can be grown in aquatic environments
   and has large-scale CO2requirements. This review article compiles
   literature focusing on the production of microalgal bioethanol and
   summarises the advantages, disadvantages, main features and key aspects
   for each process. The production of bioethanol is achieved through
   pretreatment to break down the cell wall, which is followed by
   saccharification of carbohydrates and fermentation of suitable sugars.
   An effective pretreatment should be simple, have less chemical
   consumption, and have low energy demand so that production costs can be
   reduced. Producing bioethanol by fermentation can be performed in many
   ways, such as separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and
   simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The SSF process is
   more economical, because the combination of hydrolysis and fermentation
   reduces production costs. The results of the comparison of hydrolysis
   methods show that enzymatic hydrolysis can potentially be applied to the
   production of bioethanol because of its affordable economic cost and
   less negative impact on the environment. Economic reasons, such as the
   final yield of ethanol products using this method, are higher than other
   pretreatments. Moreover, this method requires low energy, lack of
   chemicals and mild environmental conditions.

AB MicroalgaeNannochloropsissp. is a widely recognized renewable biodiesel
   feedstock. The ability of this microalgae to absorb CO2constitutes an
   added value toward reducing global warming. However, the process of
   optimizing its growth still involves many challenges. Photoinhibition,
   which takes places during microalgae cultivation when using continuous
   lighting, constitutes an unresolved problem. Therefore, the optimum
   light/dark cycle method is considered necessary. The experiments were
   conducted using a designed, tubular airlift photobioreactor and blue,
   energy-saving, light-emitting diode (LED) lights for the purpose of
   internal illumination. We observed that a 45:15 min (light:dark) cycle
   increased the production ofNannochloropsissp. biomass significantly,
   with a cell density, wet weight, and lipid content of 17 * 106cell/ml,
   7.11 g, and 10.1% dry weight, respectively. By using the blue LED
   lights, our designed, airlift photobioreactor increased cell growth by
   70% compared to the growth ofNannochloropsissp. in nature and produced
   61 times higher lipid content compared toNannochloropsissp. that is
   exposed to natural light.

AB Microalgae are considered a very promising alternative for biofuel
   production. Several strategies were developed to modulate and improve
   algae metabolites production to meet the requirements for biodiesel
   production. Most previous research evidenced that the increase of the
   lipid content is accompanied by a decrease of the biomass production,
   which increases the cost of the downstream processing. Hence, the
   challenge is to find special culture conditions that increase the lipid
   and the biomass productivities simultaneously. In the present work, we
   developed a strategy for the improvement of biomass and lipid
   productivities in a novel local microalga isolate,Chlorocystissp.
   QUCCCM14, which was not previously known as a promising strain. Indeed,
   culturing QUCCCM14 using f/2 medium with 10* NaH2PO4(0.15 g L-1NaNO3and
   5.6 mg L-1NaH2PO4) resulted in an improvement of 3.178 folds the lipid
   productivity reaching 56.121 mg L-1day-1and enhanced the biomass
   productivity reaching 141.363 mg L-1day-1, simultaneously. Comparative
   analyses of the FAME profiles demonstrated that fed-batch culture with
   phosphate or nitrate separately leads to a high production of the omega
   3 fatty acids (Linolenic acid), whereas fed-batch culture with phosphate
   and nitrate simultaneously increased the production of fatty acids
   suitable for biodiesel production.

AB Microalgal biofuel, albeit an exciting potential fossil-fuel-replacement
   candidate, still requires the development of more advanced downstream
   processing technology for its price competitiveness. The major challenge
   in a microalgae-based biorefinery is the efficient separation of
   microalgae from low-concentration culture broth. The post-harvesting
   cell-disruption step necessary to render microalgae suitable for lipid
   extraction, moreover, further raises energy consumption and cost. For
   the mitigation of biorefinery complexity and costs, we suggest herein a
   new scheme that integrates the critical downstream processes (harvesting
   and cell disruption) by means of cationic surfactant-decorated Fe3O4
   nanoparticles. The cationic surfactants' quaternary ammonium heads play
   an important role in not only flocculating negatively charged microalgae
   but also weakening thick cell walls. In the present study, the
   harvesting efficiency and cell-damaging effects of three cationic
   surfactants - cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), cetylpyridinium chloride
   (CPC), and cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) - were evaluated. The
   CTAB-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which were found to be the most
   effective, achieved a 96.6% microalgae harvesting efficiency at a dosage
   of 0.46 g particle per g cell. Next, for the purposes of magnetic
   nanoparticle recycling and high-purity microalgal biomass obtainment,
   microalgae detachment from microalgae-Fe3O4 flocs was performed by
   addition of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The
   detached CTAB-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles showed a steady reuse
   efficiency of about 80%. Furthermore, microalgae harvesting by
   CTAB-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles could contribute to a great
   improvement in the total extracted lipid content and greener wet
   extraction without the additional energy-intensive cell-disruption step,
   thus demonstrating the cell-disruption ability of CTAB-decorated Fe3O4
   nanoparticles.

   expression of genes, both native and those introduced from other
   organisms, resources within an industrial chassis can be siphoned for
   the commercial production of high-value commodities. This developing
   interdisciplinary field has the potential to revolutionize natural
   product discovery from higher plants, by providing a diverse array of
   tools, technologies, and strategies for exploring the large chemically
   complex space of plant natural products using unicellular organisms. In
   this review, we emphasize the key features that influence the generation
   of biorefineries and highlight technologies and strategic solutions that
   can be used to overcome engineering pitfalls with rational design. Also
   presented is a succinct guide to assist the selection of unicellular

AB In order to remove high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and
   refractory sulfamethazine (SM2) from swine digestion effluent, different
   carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios and salinity were used to determine the
   effects of pollutants removal in the microalgae biofilm system.
   Microalgae biofilm treatment under optimal environmental conditions in
   synthetic swine digestion effluent were C/N ratio of 20 and salinity of
   140 mM. In order to make the actual swine digestion effluent discharge
   up to the standard, three different two-cycle treatments (suspended
   microalgae, microalgae biofilm, microalgae biofilm under the optimal
   conditions) were studied. The results showed that after two-cycle
   treatment with microalgae biofilm under the optimal conditions, the
   actual swine digestion effluent levels of total nitrogen (TN), NH4+-N,
   total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), SM2 were 22.65,
   9.32, 4.11, 367.28, and 0.99 mg L-1, respectively, which could satisfy
   the discharge standards for livestock and poultry wastewater in China.
   At the same time, first-order kinetic simulation equations suggested a
   degradation half-life of 4.85 d for SM2 under optimal conditions in
   microalgae biofilm, and microbial community analysis indicated that the
   dominant genus wasHalomonas.Furthermore, 35.66% of lipid, 32.56% of
   protein and 18.44% of polysaccharides were harvested after two-cycle in
   microalgae biofilm treatment under optimal environmental conditions.
   These results indicated that the regulation of C/N and salinity in
   microalgae biofilm for the treatment of swine digestion effluent was a
   high-efficiency strategy to simultaneously achieve wastewater treatment
   and bioenergy production.

AB Photosynthetic organisms need to respond frequently to the fluctuation
   of light quality and light quantity in their habitat. In response to the
   fluctuation of different single wavelength lights, these organisms have
   to adjust and optimize the employment of light energy by redistributing
   excitation energy and remodeling photosystem stoichiometry or light
   complex structure. However, the response of whole cellular processes to
   fluctuations in single wavelength light is mostly unknown. Here, we
   report the transcriptomic and proteomic dynamics and metabolic
   adaptation mechanisms of Nannochloropsis oceanica to blue and red light.
   Preferential exposure to different light spectra induces massive
   reprogramming of the Nannochloropsis transcriptome and proteome.
   Combined with physiological and biochemical investigation, the rewiring
   of many cellular processes was observed, including carbon/nitrogen
   assimilation, photosynthesis, chlorophyll and cartenoid biosynthesis,
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging systems, and chromatin state
   regulation. A strong and rapid regulation of genes or proteins related
   to nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, ROS
   scavenging system, and carotenoid metabolism were observed during 12 h
   and 24 h of exposure under red light. Additionally, two light harvesting
   complex proteins induced by blue light and one by red light were
   observed. The differential responses of N. oceanica to red and blue
   irradiation reveal how marine microalgae adapt to change in light
   quality and can be exploited for biofuel feedstock development.

AB Biohydrogen production from microalgae is a potential alternative energy
   source that is now intensively being researched. The complex natures of
   the biological processes involved have afflicted the accuracy of
   traditional modelling and optimization, besides being costly.
   Accordingly, machine learning algorithms have been employed to overcome
   setbacks, as these approaches have the capability to predict nonlinear
   interactions and handle multivariate data from microalgal biohydrogen
   studies. Thus, the review focuses on revealing the recent applications
   of machine learning techniques in microalgal biohydrogen production. The
   working principles of random forests, artificial neural networks,
   support vector machines, and regression algorithms are covered. The
   applications of these techniques are analyzed and compared for their
   effectiveness, advantages and disadvantages in the relationship studies,
   classification of results, and prediction of microalgal hydrogen
   production. These techniques have shown great performance despite
   limited data sets that are complex and nonlinear. However, the current
   techniques are still susceptible to overfitting, which could potentially
   reduce prediction performance. These could be potentially resolved or
   mitigated by comparing the methods, should the input data be limited.

AB In this work, machine learning (ML) applications in microalgal biofuel
   production are reviewed. First, the basic steps of algal biofuel
   production are summarized followed by a bibliometric analysis to
   demonstrate the major research trends in the field. Also, the major
   challenges related to the commercialization of technology are
   identified. Then, ML applications for various steps in the value chain
   are reviewed and analyzed systematically. Finally, a future perspective
   on the contribution of ML in the field is provided. Our analysis
   indicates that ML applications should focus on screening and selecting
   suitable strains, preferably together with some other value-added
   products, requiring close collaborations among the researchers in the
   field to construct an extensive microalgal strain database. Optimization
   of cultivation conditions appears to be another area where ML can be
   helpful. Although most published ML works on cultivation are not usually
   suitable to extract generalizable knowledge (due to the nonstandard
   nature of strains, wastewater, and irradiation), standard testing and
   methodologies related to reporting protocols should also be built
   through collaboration to build comparable and generalizable ML models.

PS (22 November 2016)
PY 2016

AB Rising oil prices and concerns over climate change have resulted in more
   emphasis on research into renewable biofuels from microalgae. Unlike
   plants, green microalgae have higher biomass productivity, will not
   compete with food and agriculture, and do not require fertile land for
   cultivation. However, microalgae biofuels currently suffer from high
   capital and operating costs due to low yields and costly extraction
   methods. Microalgae grown under optimal conditions produce large amounts
   of biomass but with low neutral lipid content, while microalgae grown in
   nutrient starvation accumulate high levels of neutral lipids but are
   slow growing. Producing lipids while maintaining high growth rates is
   vital for biofuel production because high biomass productivity increases
   yield per harvest volume while high lipid content decreases the cost of
   extraction per unit product. Therefore, there is a need for metabolic
   engineering of microalgae to constitutively produce high amounts of
   lipids without sacrificing growth. Substrate availability is a
   rate-limiting step in balancing growth and fatty acid (FA) production
   because both biomass and FA synthesis pathways compete for the same
   substrates, namely acetyl-CoA and NADPH. In this review, we discuss the
   efforts made for improving biofuel production in plants and
   microorganisms, the challenges faced in achieving lipid productivity,
   and the important role of precursor supply for FA synthesis. The main
   focus is placed on the enzymes which catalyzed the reactions supplying
   acetyl-CoA and NADPH.

AB High energy prices, energy and environment security, concerns about
   petroleum supplies are drawing considerable attention to find a
   renewable biofuels. Biodiesel, a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters
   (FAMEs) derived from animal fats or vegetable oils, is rapidly moving
   towards the mainstream as an alternative source of energy. However,
   biodiesel derived from conventional petrol or from oilseeds or animal
   fat cannot meet realistic need, and can only be used for a small
   fraction of existing demand for transport fuels. In addition, expensive
   large acreages for sufficient production of oilseed crops or cost to
   feed animals are needed for raw oil production. Therefore, oleaginous
   microorganisms are available for substituting conventional oil in
   biodiesel production. Most of the oleaginous microorganisms like
   microalgae, bacillus, fungi and yeast are all available for biodiesel
   production. Regulation mechanism of oil accumulation in microorganism
   and approach of making microbial diesel economically competitive with
   petrodiesel are discussed in this review.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is effective at recovering bioenergy
   from wet microalgae, which is used for cleaning polluted water body. In
   this study, a brackish water-grown microalgae polyculture was
   hydrothermally liquefied into 26.5 wt% bio-crude oil with an energy
   consumption ratio of 2.4, indicating an energy negative process for
   bioenergy production. To improve the economic feasibility of wastewater
   algae-to-bioenergy process, a HTL byproduct, hydrochar, has been
   recycled to assemble in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) as a renewable
   anode material. Owing to the organic components produced from HTL and
   high concentrations of impurities obtained from brackish water, HTL
   hydrochar needs to be post-treated (CO2activation and 'base-acid' wash)
   to increase carbon content, leading to better electrochemical
   performance. By virtue of increased specific surface area (304.06 m2g-1)
   and massive mesopores, post-treated hydrochar exhibits reversible
   discharge-charge capacity of 226 and 223 mAh g-1at 0.1 A g-1after 40
   cycles. There is no related study to investigate the feasibility of
   brackish-grown algae-derived hydrochar as green anodes of LIBs. This
   integration will not only mitigate water pollution (algae treatment for
   brackish water), produce carbon-neutral alternative to fossil fuel
   (algae-derived biofuel production), but also valorize solid byproduct
   for generating clean energy (LIBs anodes synthesis from biomass-derived
   carbon).

AB Gradual increase in concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the
   atmosphere due to the various anthropogenic interventions leading to
   significant alteration in the global carbon cycle has been a subject of
   worldwide attention and matter of potential research over the last few
   decades. In these alarming scenario microalgae seems to be an attractive
   medium for capturing the excess CO2 present in the atmosphere generated
   from different sources such as power plants, automobiles, volcanic
   eruption, decomposition of organic matters and forest fires. This
   captured CO2 through microalgae could be used as potential carbon source
   to produce lipids for the generation of biofuel for replacing
   petroleum-derived transport fuel without affecting the supply of food
   and crops. This comprehensive review strives to provide a systematic
   account of recent developments in the field of biological carbon capture
   through microalgae for its utilization towards the generation of
   biodiesel highlighting the significance of certain key parameters such
   as selection of efficient strain, microalgal metabolism, cultivation
   systems (open and closed) and biomass production along with the national
   and international biodiesel specifications and properties. The potential
   use of photobioreactors for biodiesel production under the influence of
   various factors viz., light intensity, pH, time, temperature, CO2
   concentration and flow rate has been discussed. The review also provides
   an economic overview and future outlook on biodiesel production from
   microalgae.

AB Organic waste recycling is an important emergent technology in
   development to combat the growing crisis of nutrient scarcity. Many
   waste streams and effluents contain high concentrations of valuable
   nutrients, but chemical treatments and recovery processes are both
   fiscally and energetically expensive. Microalgae are well-studied for
   use in biological nutrient recovery systems, but conventional culture
   techniques still have significant shortcomings, especially regarding
   energy balancing. This study sampled microalgae and photosynthetic
   consortia from the local environment and artificially adapted them to
   blended, untreated wastewaters using a stepwise bioprospecting approach.
   Liquid biogas digestate (BD) was selected for its high phosphorus (P)
   and nitrogen (N) concentrations and difficulties associated with
   recycling, while aquaculture effluent (ACE) was selected to dilute BD
   for its slightly acidic pH, low turbidity, and sheer volume produced in
   Finland. Mixed consortia showed 2 * greater biomass production than
   cultures containing only eukaryotic microalgae under concentrations of
   10-25% BD. At 5% and 10% BD, all experimental consortia removed enough
   dissolved P to satisfy EU wastewater discharge standards (<2 mg/L);
   however, only 5% BD results met N discharge standards. (<15 mg/L) by the
   end of the cultivation period (10-12 d). In contrast with nutrient
   removal findings, higher BD concentration resulted in more efficient
   removal of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC, >93% removal). Biomass
   accumulation and removal of P and N were enhanced by the addition of
   plastic mesh "scaffolding"; cultures grown with scaffold demonstrated an
   increase of 0.48 g/L biomass and >60% higher rates of N and P removal
   than cultures grown without scaffolding. Taken together, these results
   provide the foundation for a circular bioeconomy approach for integrated
   biomass production, wastewater remediation, and removal of nutrients and
   carbon.

AB Algal lipids are considered to be good raw materials towards aqua feed
   formulation and biofuels production, and hence, they have been
   investigated for decades. Using external carbon source, microalgal
   cultivation has been getting attention due to high biomass productivity
   and lipid content with flexible cultivation of algae. In this present
   study, a marine microalga,Tetraselmis suecicawas cultivated by combined
   method with sodium acetate as carbon source and reciprocal nutrients
   concentration. The reciprocal concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus
   with sodium acetate supply towards lipid and fatty acid methyl esters
   (FAME) synthesis in terms of live feed efficiency was attempted. The
   highest FAME content (78.44  1.18% of DW) of alga was obtained in nil
   nitrogen condition with limited phosphate concentration (N0-PL) followed
   by N0-P (77.31  2.5% of DW) combination. Limitation of phosphate with
   combination of nil nitrogen (N0-PL) showed slight increment of total
   FAME accumulation and its higher increments resulted in mono-unsaturated
   fatty acids (MUFA) accumulation, indicating nitrogen starvation was a
   real FAME trigger under heterotrophic cultivation. Effect of
   heterotrophic cultivatedT. suecicafeeding on marine
   copepodPseudodiaptomus annandaleiproduced higher population density (119
   15 ind. L-1) in N0-P combination and high rate (71.98%) of nauplii
   production was obtained in N0-PL combination. These findings suggested
   that the heterotrophic microalgae cultivation can be practiced for aqua
   feed (especially for copepod cultivations) formulation as well as to
   phosphorous removal from wastewaters.

AB Microalgae are discussed as a potential renewable feedstock for biofuel
   production. The production of highly concentrated algae biomass with a
   high fatty acid content, accompanied by high productivity with the use
   of natural sunlight is therefore of great interest. In the current study
   an outdoor pilot plant with five 30L Flat Panel Airlift reactors (FPA)
   installed southwards were operated in 2011 in Stuttgart, Germany. The
   patented FPA reactor works on the basis of an airlift loop reactor and
   offers efficient intermixing for homogeneous light distribution. A lipid
   production process with the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (SAG 211-12),
   under nitrogen and phosphorous deprivation, was established and
   evaluated in regard to the fatty acid content, fatty acid productivity
   and light yield. In the first set of experiments limitations caused by
   restricted CO2 availability were excluded by enriching the media with
   NaOH. The higher alkalinity allows a higher CO2 content of supplied air
   and leads to doubling of fatty acid productivity. The second set of
   experiments focused on how the ratio of light intensity to biomass
   concentration in the reactor impacts fatty acid content, productivity
   and light yield. The specific light availability was specified as mol
   photons on the reactor surface per gram biomass in the reactor. This is
   the first publication based on experimental data showing the
   quantitative correlation between specific light availability, fatty acid
   content and biomass light yield for a lipid production process under
   nutrient deprivation and outdoor conditions. High specific light
   availability leads to high fatty acid contents. Lower specific light
   availability increases fatty acid productivity and biomass light yield.
   An average fatty acid productivity of 0.39 gL-1day-1 for a 12 days batch
   process with a final fatty acid content of 44.6% [w/w] was achieved.
   Light yield of 0.4 gmolphotons-1 was obtained for the first 6 days of
   cultivation.

U2 59
AB Fermentative production of butanol for use as a biofuel or chemical
   feedstock is regarded as a promising renewable technology that reduces
   greenhouse gas emissions and has the potential to become a substitute
   for non-sustainable chemical production route. However, butanol toxicity
   to the producing microbes remains a barrier to achieving sufficiently
   high titers for cost-effective butanol fermentation and recovery.
   Investigations of the external stress of high butanol concentration on
   butanol-producing microbial strains will aid in developing improved
   microbes with increased tolerance to butanol. With currently available
   molecular tool boxes, researchers have aimed to address and understand
   how butanol affects different microbes. This review will cover the
   individual organism's inherent responses to surrounding butanol levels,
   and the collective efforts by researchers to improve production and
   tolerance. The specific microorganisms discussed here include the native
   butanol producer Clostridium species, the fermentation industrial model
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the
   genetic engineering workhorse Escherichia coli, and also the
   butanol-tolerant lactic acid bacteria that utilize diverse substrates.
   The discussion will help to understand the physiology of butanol
   resistance and to identify specific butanol tolerance genes that will
   lead to informed genetic engineering strategies for new strain
   development.

AB Microalgae have great potential in producing energy-dense and valuable
   products via thermochemical processes. Therefore, producing alternative
   bio-oil to fossil fuel from microalgae has rapidly gained popularity due
   to its environmentally friendly process and elevated productivity. This
   current work aims to review comprehensively the microalgae bio-oil
   production using pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction. In addition,
   core mechanisms of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction process for
   microalgae were scrutinized, showing that the presence of lipids and
   proteins could contribute to forming a large amount of compounds
   containing O and N elements in bio-oil. However, applying proper
   catalysts and advanced technologies for the two aforementioned
   approaches could improve the quality, heating value, and yield of
   microalgae bio-oil. In general, microalgae bio-oil produced under
   optimal conditions could have 46 MJ/kg heating value and 60% yield,
   indicating that microalgae bio-oil could become a promising alternative
   fuel for transportation and power generation.

   beads withAzospirillum brasilense, under autotrophic and heterotrophic
   growth conditions, with and without ammonium starvation. ACCase is a key
   enzyme in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. Under the two growth
   conditions, co-immobilisation always enhanced the activity of ACCase and
   yielded a higher level of lipids when compared with immobilisation of
   the alga alone. The highest lipid content obtained under autotrophic
   conditions was with ammonium starvation. Cultivation under heterotrophic
   conditions without limitation of nitrogen, with or without the presence
   of bacteria, yielded a higher growth rate and accumulated more lipids
   than under autotrophic conditions. No correlation was found between
   total lipids and ACCase activity. Unusually, ammonium starvation
   significantly reduced lipid accumulation under heterotrophic conditions.
   Consequently, co-immobilisation, sufficient ammonium and heterotrophic
   growth conditions were the most significant parameters for lipid
   accumulation and ACCase activity inC. vulgariswhere the two latter
   parameters are not directly linked.

AB Microalgae are one of the most promising sources of renewable substrates
   used for energy purposes. Biomass and components accumulated in their
   cells can be used to produce a wide range of biofuels, but the
   profitability of their production is still not at a sufficient level.
   Significant costs are generated, i.a., during the cultivation of
   microalgae, and are connected with providing suitable culture
   conditions. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of using sodium
   bicarbonate as an inexpensive alternative CO2 source in the culture of
   Chlorella vulgaris, promoting not only the increase of microalgae
   biomass production but also lipid accumulation. The study was carried
   out at technical scale using 100 L photobioreactors. Gravimetric and
   spectrophotometric methods were used to evaluate biomass growth. Lipid
   content was determined using a mixture of chloroform and methanol
   according to the Blight and Dyer method, while the carbon content and
   CO2 fixation rate were measured according to the Walkley and Black
   method. In batch culture, even a small addition of bicarbonate resulted
   in a significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase in the amount of biomass,
   productivity and optical density compared to non-bicarbonate cultures.
   At 2.0 g.L-1, biomass content was 572  4 mg.L-1, the maximum
   productivity was 7.0  1.0 mg.L-1.d-1, and the optical density was 0.181 
   0.00. There was also an increase in the lipid content (26  4%) and the
   carbon content in the biomass (1322  0.062 g.dw-1), as well as a higher
   rate of carbon dioxide fixation (0.925  0.073 g.L-1.d-1). The
   cultivation of microalgae in enlarged scale photobioreactors provides a
   significant technological challenge. The obtained results can be useful
   to evaluate the efficiency of biomass and valuable cellular components
   production in closed systems realized at industrial scale.

AB Treatment of wastewater while producing microalgal biomass is receiving
   ever-increasing attention, particularly in the biofuels arena. In this
   study, a wastewater chlorophyte isolate, Kirchneriella sp., was tested
   for its ability to be mass cultivated, utilize nutrients from defined
   media and wastewater, and produce bioproducts of commercial interest.
   Growth studies were carried out in various systems at scales up to 60 L,
   with Kirchneriella sp. showing an excellent amenability to being
   cultured. Biomass concentrations of greater than 1 g L-1 were
   consistently achieved, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake was rapid, and
   stable medium-term cultures were maintained. Nitrogen limitation
   affected biomass yield, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield, and cetane
   index. In contrast, a low phosphorus condition had no effect.
   Kirchneriella sp. showed an ability to produce several products of
   commercial value, including carbohydrate-rich biomass, FAME/biodiesel
   and the pigments beta,beta-carotene and lutein.

AB Microalgae are emerging platforms for production of a suite of compounds
   targeting several markets, including food, nutraceuticals, green
   chemicals, and biofuels. Many of these products, such as biodiesel or
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), derive from lipid metabolism. A
   general picture of lipid metabolism in microalgae has been deduced from
   well characterized pathways of fungi and land plants, but recent
   advances in molecular and genetic analyses of microalgae have uncovered
   unique features, pointing out the necessity to study lipid metabolism in
   microalgae themselves. In the past 10 years, in addition to its
   traditional role as a model for photosynthetic and flagellar motility
   processes,Chlamydomonas reinhardtiihas emerged as a model organism to
   study lipid metabolism in green microalgae. Here, after summarizing data
   on total fatty acid composition, distribution of acyl-lipid classes, and
   major acyl-lipid molecular species found inC. reinhardtii, we review the
   current knowledge on the known or putative steps for fatty acid
   synthesis, glycerolipid desaturation and assembly, membrane lipid
   turnover, and oil remobilization. A list of characterized or putative
   enzymes for the major steps of acyl-lipid metabolism inC. reinhardtiiis
   included, and subcellular localizations and phenotypes of associated
   mutants are discussed. Biogenesis and composition ofChlamydomonaslipid
   droplets and the potential importance of lipolytic processes in
   increasing cellular oil content are also highlighted.

AB Energy penalty of solvent regeneration in CO2 absorption process is a
   critical challenge. To avoid the energy consumption, novel ammonia
   absorption-microalgae hybrid CO2 capture process has been designed in
   this work. In the proposed process, the conventional desorption column
   is replaced by a microalgae cultivation system. As a result, the NH4HCO3
   could be utilized as nutrient for microalgae growth and converted into
   biofuel or value-added ingredients. Meanwhile, the challenge of ammonia
   escape could be avoided via high purity ammonia recycling in the hybrid
   process. The experimental results indicated that the selected Chlorella
   sp. L166, L38 and UTEX1602 could be potential microalgae to be used in
   chemical-biological hybrid CO2 capture and utilization process with
   carbon fixation efficiency over 85%, and the yield of protein, lipid and
   polysaccharides was 164  1 mg/L (L166), 710.6  165.8 mg/L (UTEX1602) and
   143.6  28.8 mg/L (L38), respectively. The above results also indicated
   that the novel absorption-microalgae hybrid process could be a promising
   alternative to the conventional CO2 absorption technology.

AB Reducing energy penalty caused by drying and oil extraction is the most
   critical challenge in microalgae biodiesel production. In this study,
   vapor recompression and heat integration are utilized to optimize the
   performance of wet microalgae drying and oil extraction. In the
   microalgae drying stage, the hot exhaust stream is recompressed and
   coupled with wet microalgae to recover the condensate heat. In the oil
   extraction stage, the exergy rate of recovered solvent is also elevated
   by compressor and then exchanged heat with feed and bottom stream in the
   distillation column. Energy and mass balance of the intensified process
   is investigated and compared with the conventional microalgae
   drying-extraction process. The simulation results indicated that the
   total energy consumption of the intensified process can be saved by
   52.4% of the conventional route.

   of energy crisis which make it imperative to develop research and new
   renewable energy. The clean and environmentally-friendly renewable
   energy source is not only used to adjust the energy structure but also
   to reduce the negative effects significantly on the environment. Many
   countries in the world have begun to pay more attention to develop and
   utilize the renewable energy with convenient storage, expedite

   and utilization of biomass energy which is the only renewable carbon
   source can alleviate the energy crisis and reduce the

   energy with great potential of development, photosynthetic microalgae
   has a number of advantages, including carbon sequestration, emission

   development of strain and the optimization of cultivation mode for the
   production of biodiesel by photosynthetic microalgae, the various
   methods of preparing ethanol with photosynthetic microalgae and the
   application of photosynthetic microalgae in fuel cells. Also, the

AB Cyanobacteria like Synechocystis sp. can be exploited as platforms in a
   photosynthesis-to-fuels process for the generation of terpene
   hydrocarbons. Successful application of this concept requires maximizing
   photosynthesis and attaining a high endogenous carbon partitioning
   toward the desirable product. The work addressed the question of the
   regulation of beta-phellandrene synthase transgene expression in
   relation to product yield from the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway of
   cyanobacteria. The choice of strong alternative transcriptional and
   translational cis-regulatory elements and the choice of the
   Synechocystis genomic DNA loci for transgene insertion were
   investigated. Specifically, the beta-phellandrene synthase transgene was
   expressed under the control of the endogenous psbA2 promoter, or under
   the control of the Ptrc promoter from Escherichia coli with the
   translation initiation region of highly expressed gene 10 from
   bacteriophage T7. These heterologous elements allowed for constitutive
   transgene expression. In addition, the beta-phellandrene synthase
   construct was directed to replace the Synechocystis cpc operon, encoding
   the peripheral phycocyanin rods of the phycobilisome antenna. Results
   showed that a 4-fold increase in the cellular content of the
   beta-phellandrene synthase was accompanied by a 22-fold increase in
   beta-phellandrene yield, suggesting limitations in rate and yield by the
   amount of the transgenic enzyme. The work points to the limiting amount
   of transgenic terpene synthases as a potential barrier in the
   heterologous generation of terpene products via the process of
   photosynthesis.

AB Terpenoids are synthesized naturally by plants as secondary metabolites,
   and are diverse and complex in structure with multiple applications in
   bioenergy, food, cosmetics, and medicine. This makes the production of
   terpenoids such as isoprene, beta-phellandrene, farnesene, amorphadiene,
   and squalene valuable, owing to which their industrial demand cannot be
   fulfilled exclusively by plant sources. They are synthesized via the
   Methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP) and the Mevalonate pathway
   (MVA), both existing in plants. The advent of genetic engineering and
   the latest accomplishments in synthetic biology and metabolic
   engineering allow microbial synthesis of terpenoids. Cyanobacteria
   manifest to be the promising hosts for this, utilizing sunlight and CO2.
   Cyanobacteria possess MEP pathway to generate precursors for terpenoid
   synthesis. The terpenoid synthesis can be amplified by overexpressing
   the MEP pathway and engineering MVA pathway genes. According to the
   desired terpenoid, terpene synthases unique to the plant kingdom must be
   incorporated in cyanobacteria. Engineering an organism to be used as a
   cell factory comes with drawbacks such as hampered cell growth and
   disturbance in metabolic flux. This review set forth a comparison
   between MEP and MVA pathways, strategies to overexpress these pathways
   with their challenges.

AB Although microalgal biomass and environmental benefits of microalgae
   surpass those of many other feedstocks, the costs associated with up-
   and downstream technologies still hinder their further development.
   Membrane technology is an emerging technology that has been applied in
   the microalgae industry for cultivation, harvesting, and biorefinery,
   and that has contributed to achieving the economic sustainability of
   microalgal cultivation and reducing energy input. In the most studied
   field (microalgae harvesting), the lowest energy consumption is
   currently 0.67 Wh/m3when using vibrating, negatively charged, patterned
   PSf membranes with flocculation prior to filtration in an MMV system.
   However, the operational flux (95 L/m2h) is not the highest, leaving
   room for optimization. Cost calculations indicated that the total
   electrical cost is only a very small fraction (3.05%) of the total
   production cost (using the energy costs of that period, i.e., 0.1 /kWh),
   with CO2and labor suggested to be the key factors contributing to high
   production cost. Membrane-based microalgal biofilm systems recently
   gained a lot of attention as they offer a win-win strategy for low-cost
   simultaneous microalgae cultivation and harvesting. In addition, they
   can be used in other fields, such as wastewater treatment and the
   production of biochemicals. This review suggests that further studies
   should not only focus on developing new technologies but combine the
   existing technologies and find their synergistic effects to realize high
   performance and low costs.

TI Microalgal and cyanobacterial cultivation: the supply of nutrients.
SO Water Research (Oxford)
VL 65
PS 186-202
PY 2014
U1 16
U2 485
AB Microalgae and cyanobacteria are a promising new source of biomass that
   may complement agricultural crops to meet the increasing global demand
   for food, feed, biofuels and chemical production. Microalgae and
   cyanobacteria cultivation does not interfere directly with food
   production, but care should be taken to avoid indirect competition for
   nutrient (fertilizer) supply. Microalgae and cyanobacteria production
   requires high concentrations of essential nutrients (C, N, P, S, K, Fe,
   etc.). In the present paper the application of nutrients and their
   uptake by microalgae and cyanobacteria is reviewed. The main focus is on
   the three most significant nutrients, i.e. carbon, nitrogen and
   phosphorus; however other nutrients are also reviewed. Nutrients are
   generally taken up in the inorganic form, but several organic forms of
   them are also assimilable. Some nutrients do not display any inhibition
   effect on microalgal or cyanobacterial growth, while others, such as
   NO2or NH3have detrimental effects when present in high concentrations.
   Nutrients in the gaseous form, such as CO2and NO face a major limitation
   which is related mainly to their mass transfer from the gaseous to the
   liquid state. Since the cultivation of microalgae and cyanobacteria
   consumes considerable quantities of nutrients, strategies to improve the
   nutrient application efficiency are needed. Additionally, a promising
   strategy to improve microalgal and cyanobacterial production
   sustainability is the utilization of waste streams by recycling of waste
   nutrients. However, major constraints of using waste streams are the
   reduction of the range of the biomass applications due to production of
   contaminated biomass and the possible low bio-availability of some
   nutrients.

TI Comprehensive insights into conversion of microalgae to feed, food, and

AB Microalgae have been promoted as important feedstocks for producing
   biofuels and bioproducts. However, their production on a large scale
   would require a large amount of water and nutrients. Considering the
   importance of food security and the high economic value of microalgal
   biomass, food and feed applications should be prioritized if microalgae
   are grown using conventional water resources. Nevertheless, microalgae
   can also be grown in nutrient-rich wastewater streams while producing
   valuable biomass and treating harmful effluents. Because of health
   issues, food and feed applications of microalgal biomass grown using
   waste resources are not allowed; hence, it can be used as a feedstock
   for biofuel production. In line with that, this review first briefly
   discusses the applications of microalgae in food, feed, and wastewater
   treatment and then summarizes the efforts put into utilizing microalgal
   biomass to produce biofuels through different pathways. These
   technologies, including thermochemical (200-1300°C), biochemical
   (25-55°C), and chemical (25-200°C) conversion methods, are critically
   discussed. The pros and cons of using different microalgal conversion
   technologies are outlined to identify possible future directions for the
   field. Different microalgal biomass harvesting methods are also
   reviewed, and the process conditions are summarized. Parameters
   affecting technology selection, such as energy costs, reaction time, and
   technological sophistication, are also explored and presented. In
   general, microalgal biofuels still face many challenges in replacing
   traditional fossil fuels. Future work should focus on maximizing the
   yield and quality of microalgal biofuels while enhancing their economic
   viability.

AB Purpose - Currently, experimental and theoretical work is being
   performed to ensure that biofuels from microalgae become a reality.
   However, there is a considerable number of discussions concerning in
   which processes should be focussed efforts of research and development.
   The purpose of this paper is to provide decision support not only to
   help build guidelines of research to be undertaken, but also to
   contribute to the design of more adequate policy and funding
   instruments. The key objective of this study is to determine the
   prospects of employing microalgae into the production of biofuels within
   a time scale extending to 2030. Design/methodology/approach - The Delphi
   method is a qualitative research aiming to support strategic
   future-oriented action, such as policy making in the areas of science
   and technology. It is especially appropriate in judgment and long-range
   forecasting (20-30 years) situations, when expert opinions are often the
   only source of information available, due to a lack of appropriate
   historical, economic or technical data. Findings - The Delphi method
   proved to be a successful research method when expert opinions are the
   main source of information available, due to a lack of appropriate
   historical, economic or technical data and the outcomes provided a clear
   outline of the main issues of microalgae biofuels' market at present and
   in the future. Research limitations/implications - The outcomes might
   not represent the majority of the microalgae experts' opinion due to the
   sample size. Originality/value - The work presented in this paper is
   especially original. According to the authors' knowledge, this is the
   first qualitative Delphi study related to algae biofuels.

AB Increasing human population demands more fuel supply causing the release
   of hazardous greenhouse gases that could be compensated by supplementing
   with renewable and environment-friendly alternatives such as biofuels.
   The argument against the use of food crops for biofuel production that
   it may cause food shortages can be countered by using feedstock outside
   the human food chain. This opens up the possibility of using halophytes,
   algae and photosynthetic bacteria as sources of the carbon neutral
   biofuel which can be produced sustainably without compromising
   conventional agriculture. In this review we assess the suitability of
   these non-food resources as bio-fuel alternates.

AB This study is aimed to systematically estimate marginal land resources
   with different grades (total area; land with certain
   eco-environmental-economic feasibility; centralized reserve land) in
   China, and evaluate potential energy production from microalgae on
   marginal lands in the long-, mid- and near-term, based on a model. The
   annual potential energy production from algae in total marginal land of
   China (APEMC) was estimated to 4.19 billion standard coal equivalent
   (tce), far more than total annual energy consumption equivalent in China
   (TECCE) in 2007. For microalgae with 35% lipid content, the APEMC in the
   mid-term would be 37.6-65.8% of the TECCE in 2007. The corresponding
   annual CO2emission mitigation by replacement of fossil fuels by algal
   bioenergy would be 4.27-7.44 billion t. Although Southwest China
   provides the highest potential algae production in the long-term,
   Northwest China provides the highest value in the near-term.

AB To explore the energy barrier between microalgae cells that impedes
   their aggregation and their interfacial interactions with cationic
   starch (CS), this study applied the extended Derjaguin Landau Verwey
   Overbeek (eDLVO) theory combined with the flocculation performance to
   analyze the interactions. The result shows that zeta potential based
   electrostatic interaction played a determinative role no matter for the
   energy barrier or the interfacial interactions. The energy barrier
   between microalgae cells would decrease with the descend of the pH and
   it disappeared when the pH decreased to 3 and resulted in
   self-flocculation. The quantitative analysis of the interfacial
   interactions between microalgae cell and CS showed well agreement with
   the experiment data of flocculation efficiency (FE) under different
   conditions of pH and ionic strength. Thus, the quantitative findings
   will be helpful to know the aggregation and flocculation process better
   and find more effective flocculants for microalgae harvesting.

AB This research examines the growth of Chlorella sp. microalgae under
   nutrient limitation (10-200 mg NaNO3 L-1 and 10-70 mg K2HPO4 L-1) and
   different light intensities (60-450 mol photons m-2 s-1) for achieving
   maximum carbohydrate content and biomass productivity using Response
   Surface Methodology (RSM) technique. According to the results, nutrition
   limitation had considerable effect on carbohydrate accumulation
   especially phosphorus concentrations; as in constant light intensities,
   maximum carbohydrate content was obtained in minimum concentration of
   K2HPO4. Under favorable circumstances; i.e. K2HPO4=10 mg L-1, NaNO3=105
   mg L-1, and light intensity=255 mol photons m-2 s-1 the highest
   carbohydrate content by 60.9% was achieved. Moreover, Supercritical
   Water Gasification (SCWG) of carbohydrate enriched microalgal biomass is
   able to produce much more hydrogen gas in comparison to the basic
   microalgal biomass. In addition, a 1.85 times increase in amount of
   produced gas is appeared as a result of a change in biochemical
   composition of the microalgal biomass.

AB In recent years biodiesel production has attracted worldwide attention
   due to the awareness of fossil fuel depletion and microalgae biomass is
   considered a promising raw material for its formulation. The present
   study evaluated the effects of different levels of nitrogen limitation
   (37.5, 18.75, 9.375 mg L-1NaNO3) on the growth, cell ultrastructure, and
   biochemical composition of a halophilic native strain of the green
   algaPicocystis salinarumas a potential raw material source for
   biodiesel. During a culture period of 20 days, growth measurements and
   photosynthetic pigments were estimated. Cell density, dry weight, and
   chlorophyllsa,bcontent decreased with time as nitrogen limitation
   increase; however, carotenoid content increased. In addition, nitrogen
   limitation caused an progressive increase in the lipid and carbohydrate
   yield and a decrease in protein. The high N limitation (9.375 mg L-1)
   had a significant effect on the accumulation of total lipid content
   (33.87% dry weight). Carbohydrate content (30.98% dry weight) and
   protein content (1.89% dry weight) decrease. The lipid content showed a
   differential FAME profile with high saturated fatty acid values (996.08
   mug g-1dry weight) mainly palmitic acid, compare with the unsaturated
   ones that showed low values under high N limitation. The gradual
   increase of lipid content was also corroborated by transmission electron
   microscopy images with a single large lipid droplet cell formation.
   Therefore, evaluation of the algal culture conditions such as N
   limitation, as a strategy to maximize lipid content and improve the
   fatty acid profile in unexplored strain ofP. salinarum, showed a
   potential biomass yield as a suitable candidate for biodiesel
   production.

AB Phototrophic biofilms are complex conglomerations of light-driven
   microorganisms as autotrophs with heterotrophs embedded in a
   mucilaginous matrix comprising EPS (extracellular polymeric substances),
   attached to a solid surface. EPS provide structural and functional
   integrity and is essential for the physico-chemical and biological
   properties of the biofilms. These biofilms thrive in simple to extreme
   environments and comprise cyanobacteria, diatoms, microalgae, fungi,
   bacteria and protozoa. Formation of flocs/biofilms is an essential facet
   of bioremediation and wastewater treatment. Biofilm formation is a
   scourge in medical sciences, but in agriculture, they can be potent
   candidates for integrated nutrient and disease management or soil
   structure improvement, as they aid in better and effective colonization
   in soil and around roots, enabling a network from soil to the plant. The
   process of biofilm formation is intriguing and presents a challenge for
   understanding the signals and metabolites involved and the orchestration
   of multiple biochemical pathways. Metagenomic analysis of biofilms has
   unveiled complex genomic data and molecular diversity among culturable
   and non-culturable microbial communities dwelling in such biofilms;
   however, information on phototrophic biofilms is scanty.
   Particle-tracking techniques have shown the significance of water
   channels in mediating water flow, nutrient cycling and exchange of
   metabolites within the biofilm community. Proteomic analyses and their
   bioinformatic delineation have illustrated that in these biofilms, the
   phototrophic partner is involved in intercellular signaling,
   aggregation, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. The present review
   focuses on phototrophic biofilm formation, their diversity, applications
   and ecological roles with special emphasis on agriculture and allied
   sectors.

AB Background:Botryococcus brauniiis known for its high hydrocarbon
   content, thus making it a strong candidate feedstock for biofuel
   production. Previous study has revealed that a high cobalt concentration
   can promote hydrocarbon synthesis and it has little effect on growth
   ofB. brauniicells. However, mechanisms beyond the cobalt enrichment
   remain unknown. This study seeks to explore the physiological and
   transcriptional response and the metabolic pathways involved in
   cobalt-induced hydrocarbon synthesis in algae cells. Results: Growth
   curves were similar at either normal or high cobalt concentration (4.5
   mg/L), suggesting the absence of obvious deleterious effects on growth
   introduced by cobalt. Photosynthesis indicators (decline in Fv/Fm ratio
   and chlorophyll content) and reactive oxygen species parameters revealed
   an increase in physiological stress in the high cobalt concentration.
   Moreover, cobalt enrichment treatment resulted in higher crude
   hydrocarbon content (51.3% on day 8) compared with the control (43.4% on
   day 8) throughout the experiment (with 18.2% improvement finally).
   Through the de novo assembly and functional annotation of theB.
   brauniirace A SAG 807-1 transcriptome, we retrieved 196,276
   non-redundant unigenes with an average length of 1086 bp. Of the
   assembled unigenes, 89,654 (45.7%), 42,209 (21.5%), and 32,318 (16.5%)
   were found to be associated with at least one KOG, GO, or KEGG ortholog
   function. In the early treatment (day 2), the most strongly upregulated
   genes were those involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism
   and oxidative phosphorylation, whereas the most downregulated genes were
   those involved in carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis. Genes that
   produce terpenoid liquid hydrocarbons were also well identified and
   annotated, and 21 (or 29.2%) were differentially expressed along the
   cobalt treatment. Conclusions:Botryococcus brauniiSAG 807-1 can tolerate
   high cobalt concentration and benefit from hydrocarbon accumulation. The
   time-course expression profiles for fatty acid biosynthesis, metabolism,
   and TAG assembly were obtained through different approaches but had
   equally satisfactory results with the redirection of free long-chain
   fatty acid and VLCFA away from TAG assembly and oxidation. These
   molecules served as precursors and backbone supply for the fatty
   acid-derived hydrocarbon accumulation. These findings provide a
   foundation for exploiting the regulation mechanisms inB. brauniirace A
   for improved photosynthetic production of hydrocarbons.

   promising strain is crucial for effective biofuel generation.Euglena
   sanguineaone such robust freshwater species with high lipid productivity
   was explored on laboratory scale as well as in mass scale in raceway
   pond. The extracted oil's fatty acid value was only 3.8 mg KOH g-1and
   had 93% triglycerides. Acid value was reduced to 0.3 mg KOH g-1by
   esterification and the optimized parameters obtained were: methanol/oil
   ratio: 0.36, H2SO4: 10 vol.%, time: 42 min. In the subsequent
   transesterification process natural, recoverable and eco-friendly white
   mussel shell was used. Maximum yield of 98% was obtained at 6 wt.% of
   calcinated CaO for the reaction time of 80 min at 0.35 methanol/oil
   ratio. The GC-MS analysis of the algal biodiesel showed the presence of
   saturated fatty acids: C16:0, C18:0, C22:0, C24:0 and monounsaturated
   fatty acids C18:1 at appropriate level to provide better oxidation

AB Biodiesel is urgently needed to alternate transportation fuel against
   fossil energy depletion and carbon dioxide reduction. The bio-diesel
   from soybean or corn, etc. can be confronted with food crisis.
   Microalgae, therefore, has recently been spotlighted as a new source
   because it has high oil lipid with fast growth rate. Photo-bioreactor
   (PBR) can be used for microalgae cultivation against changeable outside
   weather conditions and insufficient land availability. The internal
   environmental conditions can be controlled artificially in PBRs. In this
   study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to make an optimum
   design of bubble-column PBR for mass cultivation of the microalgae
   against field limitations. A three dimensional CFD model based on the
   multi-phase model was initially validated by bubble movement, and
   independent tests in mesh and time step. A new evaluation method of
   mixing efficiency in the PBRs was developed by tracking the movement of
   particles in the PBRs connected with the growth model according to the
   light intensity. Various types of PBRs were compared quantitatively with
   consideration of a microalgae growth model adaptable for the CFD model.
   The result can be used for scaling up the PBR for mass cultivation of
   microalgae to make a year-roundly stable biodiesel production.

AB The potential of microalgae as an alternative energy source has been
   adequately studied. However, exclusive use of microalgae as an energy
   feedstocks cannot warrant their scalability and economical
   sustainability due to the high cost involved in their biomass
   processing. The co-processing of microalgae biomass with other related
   bio-refinery applications can offset their cost and improve their
   sustainability. Thus, it triggers up the need of exploring the potential
   of microalgae biomass beyond their typical use. Microalgae offer
   interesting features to qualify them as alternative feedstocks for
   various bio-refinery applications. Microalgae have unique abilities to
   utilize them for industrial and environmental applications. Thus, this
   review discusses to expand the scope of integrating microalgae with
   other biotechnological applications to enhance their sustainability. The
   use of microalgae as a feed for animal and aquaculture, fertilizers,
   medicine, cosmetic, environmental and other biotechnological
   applications is thoroughly reviewed. It also highlights the barriers,
   opportunities, developments, and prospects of extending the scope of
   microalgae. This study concludes that sustained research funding, and a
   shift of microalgae focus from biofuels production to bio-refinery
   co-products can qualify them as promising feedstocks. Moreover,
   technology integration is inevitable to off-set the cost of microalgae
   biomass processing. It is expected that this study would be helpful to
   determine the future role of microalgae in bio-refinery applications.

AB Triacylglycerols (TAG) from microalgae can be used as feedstocks for
   biofuel production to address fuel shortages. Most of the current
   research has focused on the enzymes involved in TAG biosynthesis. In
   this study, the effects of malic enzyme (ME), which provides precursor
   and reducing power for TAG biosynthesis, on biomass and lipid
   accumulation and its response to salt stress in Dunaliella salina were
   investigated. The overexpression of DsME1 and DsME2 improved the lipid
   production, which reached 0.243 and 0.253 g/L and were 30.5 and 36.3%
   higher than wild type, respectively. The transcript levels of DsME1 and
   DsME2 increased with increasing salt concentration (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.5
   mol/L NaCl), indicating that DsMEs participated in the salt stress
   response in D. salina. It was found that cis-acting elements associated
   with the salt stress response were present on the promoters of two
   DsMEs. The deletion of the MYB binding site (MBS) on the DsME2 promoter
   confirmed that MBS drives the expression of DsME2 to participate in
   osmotic regulation in D. salina. In conclusion, MEs are the critical
   enzymes that play pivotal roles in lipid accumulation and osmotic
   regulation. This publication is licensed under the terms of your

TI The conventional microalgal biofuel production process and the
   alternative milking pathway: a review.
SO Energy (Oxford)
VL 277

U1 5
U2 16
AB Microalgal biofuel shows a promising potential for replacing
   nonrenewable fuel sources such as fossil fuels, as a response to the
   world's energy, economic, and environmental crisis. Although microalgae
   have many merits, the low economic viability of its biofuel production
   process requires collaborative interdisciplinary research to pave the
   way for commercializing this green fuel alternative. This paper reviews
   and evaluates the current status of microalgal biofuel production
   processes and presents a richer understanding of the available
   production pathways by comparing between various cultivation modes and
   systems, harvesting methods, lipid extraction methods, and conversion
   methods, in terms of advantages, disadvantages, feasibility, among other
   aspects. This study adds to the existing literature by shedding light on
   the non-destructive lipid extraction method (milking) and comparing it
   with the conventional extraction process. The results suggest that the
   milking method is superior to the conventional process because it
   eliminates harvesting costs, minimizes recultivation, decreases nutrient
   supply, and other advantages that are mentioned in this paper.
   Nevertheless, the development of this process requires better
   understanding of its mechanism and the microalgae strains which are
   suitable for it. Additionally, this study recommends integrating the
   biorefinery concept into the production of microalgal biofuel,
   implementing genetic engineering to tailor microalgae strains for the
   milking process, and utilizing artificial intelligence and process
   automation to speed up the technology development process.

AB The economic potential of outdoor microalgal bacterial floc (MaB-floc)
   raceway ponds as wastewater treatment technology and bioresource of
   biomass for fertilizer, shrimp feed, phycobiliproteins and biogas in
   Northwest Europe is assessed. This assessment is based on cost data
   provided by industry experts, on experimental data obtained from
   pilot-scale outdoor MaB-floc ponds treating aquaculture and
   food-industry effluents, and from different biomass valorization tests.
   MaB-floc ponds exhibit a cost-performance of EUR 0.25-0.50 m-3wastewater
   which is similar to conventional wastewater treatment technologies. The
   production cost of MaB-flocs in aquaculture and food industry effluent
   is EUR 5.29 and 8.07 kg-1TSS, respectively. Capital costs and pond
   mixing costs are the major expenses. Commercializing MaB-flocs as
   aquaculture feed generates substantial revenues, but the largest profit
   potential lies in production of high-purity phycobiliproteins from
   MaB-flocs. These results highlight the large economic potential of
   MaB-floc technology, and justify its further development.

VL 386
PY 2023
U1 25
U2 145
AB Some mixotrophic microalgae appear to exceed the sum of photoautotrophy
   and heterotrophy in terms of biomass production. This paper mainly
   reviews the carbon and energy metabolism of microalgae to reveal the
   synergistic mechanisms of the mixotrophic mode from multiple aspects. It
   explains the shortcomings of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth,
   highlighting that the mixotrophic mode is not simply the sum of
   photoautotrophy and heterotrophy. Specifically, microalgae in
   mixotrophic mode can be divided into separate parts of photoautotrophic
   and heterotrophic cultures, and the synergistic parts of
   photoautotrophic culture enhance aerobic respiration and heterotrophic
   culture enhance the Calvin cycle. Additionally, this review argues that
   current deficiencies in mixotrophic culture can be improved by
   uncovering the synergistic mechanism of the mixotrophic mode, aiming to
   increase biomass growth and improve quality. This approach will enable
   the full utilization of advantages in various fields, and provide
   research directions for future microalgal culture.

AB Background: Microbial bioengineering has the potential to become a key
   contributor to the future development of human society by providing
   sustainable, novel, and cost-effective production pipelines. However,
   the sustained productivity of genetically engineered strains is often a
   challenge, as spontaneous non-producing mutants tend to grow faster and
   take over the population. Novel strategies to prevent this issue of
   strain instability are urgently needed. Results: In this study, we
   propose a novel strategy applicable to all microbial production systems
   for which a genome-scale metabolic model is available that aligns the
   production of native metabolites to the formation of biomass. Based on
   well-established constraint-based analysis techniques such as OptKnock
   and FVA, we developed anin silicopipeline-FRUITS-that specifically
   'Finds Reactions Usable in Tapping Side-products'. It analyses a
   metabolic network to identify compounds produced in anabolism that are
   suitable to be coupled to growth by deletion of their re-utilization
   pathway(s), and computes their respective biomass and product formation
   rates. When applied toSynechocystissp. PCC6803, a model cyanobacterium
   explored for sustainable bioproduction, a total of nine target
   metabolites were identified. We tested our approach for one of these
   compounds, acetate, which is used in a wide range of industrial
   applications. The model-guided engineered strain shows an obligatory
   coupling between acetate production and photoautotrophic growth as
   predicted. Furthermore, the stability of acetate productivity in this
   strain was confirmed by performing prolonged turbidostat cultivations.
   Conclusions: This work demonstrates a novel approach to stabilize the
   production of target compounds in cyanobacteria that culminated in the
   first report of a photoautotrophic growth-coupled cell factory. The
   method developed is generic and can easily be extended to any other
   modeled microbial production system.

AB Hydrogen has shown enormous potential to be an alternative fuel of the

   last few decades due to advantages such as its high conversion
   efficiency, recyclability and non-polluting nature. Over the last few
   decades, biological hydrogen production has shown great promise for
   generating large scale sustainable energy to meet ever increasing global
   energy demands. Various microorganisms, namely bacteria, cyanobacteria,
   and algae which are capable of producing hydrogen from water, solar
   energy, and a variety of organic substrates, are explored and studied in
   detail. Current biohydrogen production technologies, however, face two
   major challenges such as low-yield and high production cost. Advances
   have been made in recent years in biohydrogen research to improve the
   hydrogen yield through process modifications, physiological
   manipulations, through metabolic and genetic engineering. Recently, cell
   immobilization such as microbes trapping with nanoparticles within the
   bioreactor has shown an increase in hydrogen production. This review
   critically evaluated various biological hydrogen production
   technologies, key challenges, and recent advancements in biohydrogen
   research and development.

AB Microalgae are being considered as a viable feedstock for large-scale
   production of biodiesel. However, though it may look simpler to obtain
   lipids from microalgae, the overall process of choosing an algal strain,
   cultivation, harvesting, dewatering, and extraction of oil is quite
   complicated and not economically prudent at this time. A thorough
   understanding of algae and the overall biodiesel production process
   discussed in this paper is vital so that focused research might lower
   the costs involved. Various diverse species of microalgae are currently
   being used as feedstocks for biofuel. Heterotrophic culture may be
   preferred over photoautotrophic cultivation. For cultivation, specially
   fabricated photobioreactors (PBRs) have the capability to overcome the
   constraints and limitations of the open raceway ponds, although the
   former are cost intensive as compared to the latter. Exergy analysis of
   algal-biodiesel-carbon dioxide cycle shows the overall process to be
   renewable and hence should attain global attention.

   lipid production under such stresses. In this study, two nutrients viz.
   nitrogen and phosphorus were modulated to see its effect on lipid
   productivity in selected cyanobacteria and its correlation with Accase
   followed by molecular dynamics simulation. Results: Selected
   cyanobacteria viz.Oscillatoriasp. (SP8),Anabaenasp. (SP12),Anabaenasp.
   (SP13),Microcoleussp. (SP18), andNostocsp. (SP20) varied in their
   ability to accumulate lipids which ranged from a lowest of 0.13%
   inAnabaenasp. (SP13) to the maximum of 7.24% inMicrocoleussp.
   (SP18).Microcoleussp. (SP18) also recorded highest lipid accumulation at
   both N (6 mM NaNO3) and P (0.20 mM K2HPO4) limiting conditions. The
   overall expression ofaccD was found to be upregulated in
   bothOscillatoriasp. (SP8) andMicrocoleussp. (SP18) for all nitrogen
   concentrations but was differentially regulated with both positive and
   negative induction under phosphorus stress conditions. Maximum induction
   was observed inMicrocoleussp. (SP18) at 0.20 mM K2HPO4. The obtained 3D
   structure of SP8 protein (21.8 kDa) showed six &alpha; helices, while
   SP18 protein (16.7 kDa) exhibited four &alpha; helices and four beta
   sheets. The phi (Upsilon)/psi(psi) angles of the amino acid residues
   observed in Ramachandran plot analysis showed that both SP8 and SP18
   proteins were highly stable with more than 90% amino acids in allowed
   regions. The molecular dynamics simulation results also indicated the
   stability of ligand-bound protein complexes. Conclusion: It has been
   demonstrated that cyanobacterial isolates are affected differently by
   nutrient limitation leading to variation in their lipid productivity.
   The same has been revealed by the behavior of accD gene expression which
   was regulated more by nutrients concentrations rather than the organism.
   However, the ligand-bound protein complexes were stable throughout MD
   simulations.

AB With the depletion of global petroleum and its increasing price,
   biodiesel has been becoming one of the most promising biofuels for
   global fuels market. Researchers exploit oleaginous microorganisms for
   biodiesel production due to their short life cycle, less labor required,
   less affection by venue, and easier to scale up. Many oleaginous
   microorganisms can accumulate lipids, especially triacylglycerols
   (TAGs), which are the main materials for biodiesel production. This
   review is covering the related research on different oleaginous
   microorganisms, such as yeast, mold, bacteria and microalgae, which
   might become the potential oil feedstocks for biodiesel production in
   the future, showing that biodiesel from oleaginous microorganisms has a
   great prospect in the development of biomass energy. Microbial oils
   biosynthesis process includes fatty acid synthesis approach and TAG
   synthesis approach. In addition, the strategies to increase lipids
   accumulation via metabolic engineering technology, involving the
   enhancement of fatty acid synthesis approach, the enhancement of TAG
   synthesis approach, the regulation of related TAG biosynthesis bypass
   approaches, the blocking of competing pathways and the multi-gene
   approach, are discussed in detail. It is suggested that DGAT and ME are
   the most promising targets for gene transformation, and reducing PEPC
   activity is observed to be beneficial for lipid production.

AB In recent years, microalgae biodiesel has attracted expressive attention
   and investment, once it was considered a potential resource for energy.
   Although the wide use of microalgae biodiesel is restricted by its high
   production cost. For cost-efficient and sustainable production of
   biodiesel from microalgae, a proper understanding of the variables and
   their impacts on physiology of the strains is required. In this study, a
   simple factorial design 23was used to find optimal conditions for the
   cultivation ofAnkistrodesmussp. and Chlamydomonas sp. in batch culture.
   The three components considered were nitrate, phosphate and sodium
   chloride, used to assess the metabolic versatility of the strains in
   brackish conditions. The results showed that culture medium with 0.04
   g.L-1nitrate, 0.01 g.L-1phosphate and 5.0 g.L-1sodium chloride resulted
   to be the most effective condition to growth and fatty acids
   accumulation. Using this optimal condition,Ankistrodesmussp.
   andChlamydomonassp. increased in 2.1 and 2.4 folds their fatty acids
   yield, respectively. Importantly, this protocol reduced 75% of the
   nitrate and phosphate concentrations of the original medium (ASM-1).
   Additionally, fatty acids analysis found that these strains were mainly
   constituted of C16-C18, in accordance with the requirements for
   biodiesel production. The simple factorial design applied here proved to
   be an important tool towards a better understanding of synergistic
   effects of tested factors on microalgae metabolism, and the resulting
   information could be used effectively to improve microalgae cultivation.

AB Algal cultivation at high latitudes is challenged by the relatively low
   annual solar flux. One possible scenario to overcome this limitation is
   the use of mixotrophic growth to potentially boost biomass and lipid
   production. Here the effect of glycerol addition on the growth and lipid
   production by twelve indigenous microalgae was examined. The results
   show that there is considerable strain dependent variation in the
   maximum growth rate under mixotrophic conditions with the addition of
   glycerol causing in some cases up to a 2.4-fold increase in growth rate
   and a up to a 1.9-fold increase in biomass. In addition, glycerol
   increased total lipid production 40-60% in some strains. These results
   also show the value in screening culture collections for desired traits
   independent of strain identification since here one (PCH02) of the five
   Chlorella strains showed a large increase in lipid with glycerol.

AB Lutein, a bioactive xanthophyll, has recently attracted significant
   attention for numerous health benefits, e.g., protection of eye health,
   macular degeneration, and acute and chronic syndromes etc. Microalgae
   have emerged as the best platform for high-value lutein production with
   high productivity, lutein content, and scale-up potential. Algal lutein
   possesses numerous bioactivities, hence widely used in pharmaceuticals,
   nutraceuticals, aquaculture, cosmetics, etc. This review highlights
   advances in upstream lutein production enhancement and feasible
   downstream extraction and cell disruption techniques for a large-scale
   lutein biorefinery. Besides bioprocess-related advances, possible
   solutions for existing production challenges in microalgae-based lutein
   biorefinery, market potential, and emerging commercial scopes of lutein
   and its potential health applications are also discussed. The key
   enzymes involved in the lutein biosynthesizing
   Methyl-Erythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway have been briefly described.
   This review provides a comprehensive updates on lutein research

AB Microalgae offer great potential for exploitation, including the
   production of biodiesel, but the process is still some way from being
   carbon neutral or commercially viable. Part of the problem is that there
   is little established background knowledge in the area. We should look
   both to achieve incremental steps and to increase our fundamental
   understanding of algae to identify potential paradigm shifts. In doing
   this, integration of biology and engineering will be essential. In this
   review we present an overview of a potential algal biofuel pipeline, and
   focus on recent work that tackles optimization of algal biomass
   production and the content of fuel molecules within the algal cell.

AB Microalgae are capable of synthesizing high levels of triacylglycerol
   (TAG) which can be used as precursor compounds for fuels and specialty
   chemicals. Algal TAG accumulation typically occurs when cellular cycling
   is delayed or arrested due to nutrient limitation, an environmental
   challenge (e.g., pH, light, temperature stress), or by chemical
   addition. This work is a continuation of previous studies detailing
   sodium bicarbonate-induced TAG accumulation in the alkaline
   chlorophyteScenedesmussp. WC-1. It was found that upon sodium
   bicarbonate amendment, bicarbonate is the ion responsible for TAG
   accumulation; a culture amendment of approximately 15 mM bicarbonate was
   sufficient to arrest the cellular cycle and switch the algal metabolism
   from high growth to a TAG accumulating state. However, the cultures were
   limited in dissolved inorganic carbon one day after the amendment,
   suggesting additional carbon supplementation was necessary. Therefore,
   additional abiotic and biotic experimentation was performed to evaluate
   in- and out-gassing of CO2. Cultures to which 40-50 mM of sodium
   bicarbonate were added consumed DIC faster than CO2could ingas during
   the light hours and total photosynthetic oxygen production was elevated
   as compared to cultures that did not receive supplemental inorganic
   carbon.

   growth rate of microalgae. This review examines past work involving the
   stimulation ofChlorellasp. growth and metabolite production by plant
   growth substances as well as by mixed cultures ofChlorellasp. with
   bacteria. Plant growth substances known to regulateChlorellasp. growth
   and metabolite production include auxins, cytokinins, abscisic acid,
   polyamines, brassinosteroids, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and
   combinations of two or three of the aforementioned substances. Mixed
   cultures of bacteria are examined, including both natural bacteria-algae
   consortia and artificially induced symbioses. For natural consortia,
   commonly occurring bacterial species, including the
   generaBrevundimonasandSphingomonas, are discussed. For artificially
   induced symbioses, the use of the nitrogen-fixing
   bacteriumAzospirillumis examined in detail. In particular, a variety of
   studies have involved the coimmobilization ofChlorellasp.
   withAzospirillumsp. in alginate beads, with the goal of using the mixed
   culture to treat wastewater. In summary, the use of plant growth
   substances and mixed cultures provides two methods to increase the
   growth ofChlorellasp., whether for the production of lipids for
   biofuels, the production of bioproducts, the treatment of wastewater, or
   a variety of other reasons.

AB BACKGROUND: Microalgal biodiesel is one of the best promising candidates
   as an alternative liquid fuel in response to the energy crisis. The
   timely development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly
   culture systems for enhancing microalgae production on a commercial
   scale is extremely important. In this study, the effects of the process
   variables temperature, LED light source (blue, white, red), light
   intensity and aeration rate on biomass production, and the effects of
   the renewal rate and cycle time on the culture harvest of the marine
   microalgaIsochrysissp. were investigated using Box-Behnken design (BBD)
   and central composite design (CCD), respectively. RESULTS: The biomass
   productivity and lipid content ofIsochrysissp. significantly depended on
   temperature. Maximum biomass productivity was achieved under white LED
   light. The optimal conditions for biomass production ofIsochrysissp.
   with economic cost and energy consumption were a culture temperature of
   35°C, white LED illumination, light intensity 182 mumol m-2s-1and an
   aeration rate of 1.0 L L-1min-1. A medium renewal rate of 30% and a
   culture harvest cycle time of three days resulted in the highest biomass
   productivity forIsochrysissp. The respective biomass productivities
   predicted by the models were in good agreement with the results obtained

AB Harvesting is one of the key challenges to determine the feasibility of
   producing biodiesel from algae. This paper presents experimental results
   for a cost-effective system to harvestChaetoceros calcitrans, using
   natural sedimentation, flocculation, and inducing pH. No efficient
   sedimentation of microalgal cells was observed only by gravity. By
   alkalinity-induced flocculation, at a pH value of 9.51, 86% recovery of
   the cells was achieved with a sedimentation rate of 125 cm/h and a
   concentration factor (CF) of 4 (volume/volume (v/v)) in 10 min. The
   maximum photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) of
   concentrated cells was almost the same as fresh culture (0.621).
   Commercial flocculants, aluminium sulphate and poly-aluminium chloride
   (PAC), were also successful in harvesting the studied algal cells.
   Optimum concentration of aluminium sulphate (AS) could be concluded as
   10 ppm with 87.6% recovery and 7.10 CF (v/v) in 30 min for
   cost-efficient harvesting, whereas for PAC it was 20 ppm with 74%
   recovery and 6.6 CF (v/v).Fv/Fmyields of concentrated cells with AS and
   PAC showed a 1% reduction compared to fresh culture. Mg+2was the
   triggering ion for alkalinity-induced flocculation in the conditions
   studied. The rheology behaviour of the concentrated cells was Newtonian
   with values between 2.2*10-3and 2.3*10-3Pa s at 30°C.

U1 11
U2 28
AB Microalgae represent a promising renewable feedstock for the sustainable
   production of biohydrogen. Their high growth rates and ability to fix
   carbon utilizing just sunlight, water, and nutrients make them
   well-suited for this application. Recent advancements have focused on
   improving microalgal hydrogen yields and cultivation methods. This
   review aims to summarize recent developments in microalgal cultivation
   techniques and genetic engineering strategies for enhanced biohydrogen
   production. Specific areas of focus include novel microalgal species
   selection, immobilization methods, integrated hybrid systems, and
   metabolic engineering. Studies related to microalgal strain selection,
   cultivation methods, metabolic engineering, and genetic manipulations
   were compiled and analyzed. Promising microalgal species with high
   hydrogen production capabilities such asSynechocystissp.,Anabaena
   variabilis, andChlamydomonas reinhardtiihave been identified.
   Immobilization techniques like encapsulation in alginate and integration
   with dark fermentation have led to improved hydrogen yields. Metabolic
   engineering through modulation of hydrogenase activity and
   photosynthetic pathways shows potential for enhanced biohydrogen
   productivity. Considerable progress has been made in developing
   microalgal systems for biohydrogen. However, challenges around process
   optimization and scale-up remain. Future work involving metabolic
   modeling, photobioreactor design, and genetic engineering of electron
   transfer pathways could help realize the full potential of this
   renewable technology.

   fromChlorella protothecoides. In tandem with solvent extraction, we
   applied 10, 50, 100, 200, and 300 60 kV/cm, 60 ns duration EPs or 3, 17,
   33, 67, and 100 60 kV/cm, 300 ns duration EPs to match the energy
   densityuapplied to the sample for each EP duration. Lipid recovery
   increased with increasingufor each EP duration until reaching a maximum
   for 17 300 ns EPs (the second lowestu) and 100 60 ns EPs (the third
   lowestu) to achieve a 13.3% and 16.1% increase in lipid extraction,
   respectively. Lipid extraction declined at higherudue to increased cell
   lysis. The largest net energy released calculated from the difference
   between the energy available from the extracted lipids and the applied
   energy of the EPs occurred at the lowestufor each EP duration. Applying
   trains of 100 mus EPs induced qualitatively similar behavior. These
   results suggest that a more detailed parametric study may optimize EP
   parameters for net energy release for specific microalgae and solvents.

TI Insights into the potential impact of algae-mediated wastewater
   beneficiation for the circular bioeconomy: a global perspective.
SO Journal of Environmental Management
VL 297
PY 2021
U1 3
U2 63
AB Algae-based technologies are one of the emerging solutions to societal
   issues such as accessibility to clean water and carbon-neutral energy
   and are a contender for the circular bioeconomy . In this review, recent
   developments in the use of different algal species for nutrient recovery
   and biomass production in wastewater, challenges, and future
   perspectives have been addressed. The ratio and bioavailability of
   nutrients in wastewater are vital parameters, which significantly impact
   nutrient recovery efficiency and algal biomass production . However, the
   optimum nutrient concentration and ratio may vary depending upon the
   microalgal species as well as cultivation conditions. The use of
   indigenous algae and algae-based consortia with other microorganisms has
   been proved promising in improving nutrient recovery efficiency and
   biomass production in pilot scale operations. However, environmental and
   cultivation conditions also play a significant role in determining the
   feasibility of the process. This review further focused on the
   assessment of the potential benefits of algal biomass production,
   renewable biofuel generation, and CO2 sequestration using wastewater in
   different countries on the basis of available data on wastewater
   generation and estimated nutrient contents. It was estimated that 5-10%
   replacement of fossil crude requirement with algal biofuels would
   require ~952-1903 billion m3 of water, 10-21 billion tons of nitrogen,
   and 2-4 billion tons of phosphorus fertilizers . In this context,
   coupling wastewater treatment and algal biomass production seem to be
   the most sustainable option with potential global benefits of polishing
   wastewater through nutrients recycling and carbon dioxide sequestration.

TI Converting biomass into bio-asphalt - a review.
SO IOP Conference Series : Earth and Environmental Science
VL 682
PY 2021
U1 0
U2 0
AB The partial substitution of bio-binder for petroleum asphalt binder is
   possible in the pavement application. Biomass commonly employed
   renewable energy origin is normally a raw substance used for the
   production of bio-binder, which includes palm oil, microalgae, soybean
   oil, vegetable oil, engine oil residue, grape remains, swine waste and
   many others. This review addresses the diverse bio-oils produced from
   different biomasses, followed by the properties of bio-oils and
   performance of bio-asphalt. This review also emphasises on the
   hydrothermal processing of biomass and the parameters affecting the
   quality and quantity of the yield for the use in asphalt. Notably,
   hydrothermal processing is a crucial thermochemical converting procedure
   employed on biomass into materials or biofuel. Following the aimed
   products, such as bio-gas, bio-oil, or bio-carbon, the variables
   selected during the operation (pressure, temperature, and time) is very
   critical. A notable impact has been placed in assessing a wide range of
   biomass supplies for hydrothermal processing due to the suitability of
   the operation for any biomass category. Provided that the majority of
   the biomass supplies are highly moisturised, the hydrothermal operation
   is the most efficacious method of processing the supplies. On the other
   hand, the physical, and rheological properties of the biobinders or
   bio-asphalt were highlighted and discussed. Majority of the bio-oils
   were found to improve the low-temperature performance, but reduce the
   resistance against deformation at high temperature of the bio-asphalt.
   It was also suggested that further studies should emphasise on the
   interaction between the asphalt matrix and bio-oils added at the
   microscale.

AB Microalgae culture has received increasing attention, given its
   prospects as a source of bioenergy and its potential for wastewater
   treatment. In this respect, simple and easily cultivated biomass have a
   number of applications, ranging from its direct use as fertilizer and as
   animal feed to sophisticated high value products, such as biodiesel and
   various pigments. The demand for these products is increasing due to
   their properties, which are economically and environmentally viable
   options. The complication of cultivation methods and the high cost of
   growth medium have become a major drawback for the algal industry; thus,
   the integration with wastewater treatment has provided a feasible
   solution because the exploitation of wastewater as the source of growth
   medium simultaneously eliminates the requirement for expensive medium
   and remediates the wastewater. This review article discusses the
   potential, benefits, strategies, and challenges for microalgae to be
   integrated with wastewater treatment, particularly palm oil mill
   effluent (POME) treatment in Malaysia due to the hazardous properties of
   POME, which may lead to severe pollution. The integration of POME
   treatment by microalgae culturing will potentially reduce the wastewater
   treatment retention time and eliminate toxic elements, which are
   nutrients for the microalgae. The exploration of new algae integration
   methods for the development and formation of valuable products is also
   discussed in this review.

   review.
SO Water
VL 15

PY 2023
U1 0
U2 24
AB Eutrophication-resistant phytoplankton communities in freshwater
   ecosystems have a novel lipid potential to contribute to the development
   of tropical regions. The question that arises due to the
   unsustainability of their eutrophicated waters is how the recognition of
   the lipids of the resident phytoplankton progresses. Our aim was to
   provide an overview of the pico-, nano- and micro-cellular lipids of
   phytoplankton with a focus on eutrophic tropical freshwater ecosystems.
   Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, global and Latin American publications
   were retrieved based on search equations and specific questions. In
   total, 490 studies were reviewed. The inclusion criteria, in order, were
   (1) peer-reviewed articles, (2) articles investigating phytoplankton
   strains or communities from any aquatic environment, (3) articles on
   freshwater ecosystems, and (4) research in tropical climates. The
   contribution of freshwater phytoplankton was high and discontinuous,
   with a representation of 63% in the 21st century. Freshwater themes were
   resolved in the ecological context with phytoplankton or algae keywords,
   while microalgae were targeted using resource use keywords. On the
   tropical scale, technological themes on lipid microalgae were related to
   fatty acids, biofuels, biodiesel, antioxidants, and recombinant DNA. It
   is concluded that studies of the lipid composition of phytoplankton
   communities are delayed in the case of eutrophic tropical freshwater
   ecosystems.

AB The major challenges which large scale biofuel industries facing are
   nutrient supply, harvesting and lipid extraction. The high cost of algal
   biofuel production makes it economically not feasible for commercial
   use. Oleaginous microbes are preferred for biofuel production, as they
   will be having lipid content more than 20 per cent of their dry weight.
   Among the other microbes, yeasts are most preferred as they have high
   lipid content and relatively faster growth rate. Microalgae are also
   advantageous as potential lipid producers and are capable of producing
   lipid via photosynthesis. Mixed cultivation of yeast with microalgae can
   be preferred to carry out an improved lipid production as microalgae in
   a medium act as an oxygen producer for the yeast cells, while yeast will
   provide carbon dioxide to microalgae. This consortium of yeast and
   microalgae produce lipid with more saturated fatty acids, high oxidative
   stability, make harvesting easy and also be grown in wastewater which
   indicates its potential use as an economical biodiesel feedstock.

AB The paper presents a mathematical model of a continuous-flow bioreactor
   in which cultivation ofPseudochlorococcumsp. algae proceeds. The process
   is directed on synthesis of neutral lipids, which are used for
   production of third-generation biodiesel . The model takes into account
   influence of light and nutrient limitation on the growth of microalgae.
   Numerical simulations were performed in order to determine steady-state
   properties of the bioreactor. The influence of key process parameters
   was investigated and detailed process interpretation was presented.
   Existence of optimal dilution rate and optimal influent nitrogen
   concentration was proved. In order to obtain maximum lipids
   productivity, lower dilution rate is required for higher influent
   inorganic nitrogen concentration. The factor limiting the process
   changes with the increase in the dilution rate. At low dilution rates
   the process is limited by nitrogen. At intermediate dilution rates the
   process is limited by light, whereas at high dilution rates the process
   is once again limited by nitrogen. Existence of a critical irradiance
   below which the biomass wash-out occurs was shown. The results presented
   are both of cognitive and practical importance.

AB Microalgae are a sustainable energy source because of their lipid
   storage capacity. However, the cultivation of microalgae requires
   optimization to produce a high biomass and lipid content. Stressing the
   cell is a common approach that is applied to increase the lipid content
   of the algae. Within this context, sodium chloride (NaCl) stress and
   magnesium (Mg2+) limitations were applied individually and mutually to
   understand their potential effects on biomass, lipid quantity, and the
   fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) profile of Auxenochlorella
   protothecoides. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents as high as 43.9%
   were obtained at 0 mg L-1 Mg2+ with 5 g L-1 NaCl. The highest linoleic
   acid content (35.2%) was obtained at 0.3 mg L-1 Mg2+ with 2.5 g L-1
   NaCl. However, the highest biomass was achieved at 18.5 mg L-1 Mg2+ with
   5.0 g L-1 NaCl according to surface response methodology. These
   optimization data could be useful for producing a feasible and
   sustainable biodiesel production strategy with high biomass and lipid
   productivity.

TI Arthrospira (Spirulina) in tannery wastewaters. Part 2: Evaluation of
   tannery wastewater as production media for the mass culture of
   Arthrospira biomass.
SO Water SA
VL 39
IS 2
PS 279-284
PY 2013
U1 0
U2 47
AB Mass blooms of Arthrospira (Spirulina) have been reported in waste
   stabilisation ponds treating tannery wastewaters and have been linked to
   a reduction in odour emissions in these systems. However, these blooms
   are unstable and unreliable, forming and disappearing in an apparently
   unpredictable manner, and they have remained poorly understood.
   Controlled production of Arthrospira biomass in this medium could not
   only be used to enable a more predictable control of odour in these
   systems (as detailed in Part 1 of this report), but could also provide a
   biomass product with external value. Techno-economic studies of
   microalgal biomass production have identified the cost of growth media
   formulation as a critical driver in the profitability of the algal
   biotechnology enterprise. Apart from the potential feed value of
   Arthrospira biomass as a product, the renewed interest in, and possibly
   marginal economics of, biofuels production from the microalgae has
   refocused attention on the possible advantages of wastewater use as
   low-cost production media. Part 2 of this study reports the
   investigation of factors regulating Arthrospira growth in the tannery
   wastewater medium and thus requiring active control in order to optimise
   biomass production. It was shown that Arthrospira growth in this
   high-protein, low-carbonate medium is under ammonia control, rather than
   nutrient limitation, as may previously have been thought. It was also
   shown that an effective mass culture strategy in this medium would
   require a maximum effluent loading rate that operates as a function of
   the optimised ammonia removal rate. Growth optima were demonstrated for
   ammonia and bicarbonate levels of 20 mg.l-1 and 12-17 g.l-1,
   respectively, and inhibition of growth was demonstrated at ammonia
   levels above 60 mg.l-1. Both autotrophic and mixotrophic growth of
   Arthrospira was observed and organic uptake may contribute to a
   stimulation of biomass production compared to growth in defined
   inorganic media. Heavy metal accumulation may present a toxicity hazard
   where biomass is targeted for use in animal feed rations. A heavy metals
   removal step was investigated involving the passage of the tannery
   effluent through an anaerobic sulphide-generating compartment in a
   primary pond, prior to its use in Arthrospira production. An acceptable
   Arthrospira feed-grade biomass was produced in this way. These results
   indicate potential cost-benefit advantages in the use of tannery
   effluent-based growth media for Arthrospira biomass production, and
   waste nutrient recovery may mitigate negative energy yield problems
   where the biomass is further processed in biofuels manufacture.

AB Microalgae have long been considered promising microorganisms, due to
   their potential as a source of valuable pharmaceuticals, pigments,
   carbohydrates, biofuels and other fine chemicals. High-density
   microalgal photobioreactors have been considered for exploiting the
   biotechnological potential of microalgae.Haematococcus pluvialisis
   considered to be the richest natural source of astaxanthin for
   pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic applications. One of the key
   challenges was to provide light sources that are more efficient, to
   deliver light more efficiently to the microalgal culture. Recent
   developments in highly efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have made
   possible the development of LED-based photobioreactors (PBR). We
   investigated the effects of various LEDs on the growth and astaxanthin
   production fromH. pluvialis. The mixture of red and blue was found to be
   the most effective light source for growing this microalga. The ratio of
   mixed red-blue showed the best growth and astaxanthin production. The
   maximum biomass and astaxanthin production with illumination by mixed
   red-blue LEDs was 1.54 g/litre and 20.12 mg/litre, respectively. Biomass
   and astaxanthin were enhanced by a maximum of 4.84 g/litre and 124.96
   mg/litre, with the mixed red-blue illumination at high light intensity
   160 E/m/1. Two stage cultures for large scale cultivation using tubular
   photobioreactor with LED lighting panels was firstly investigated in
   this study.

AB A critical analysis of the novel sewage treatment concept of anaerobic
   digestion followed by CO2 capture by microalgae has been carried out,
   with particular reference to India. The anaerobic process would convert
   the sewage COD into methane and CO2, the latter being converted into
   microalgae in a photobioreactor process, using sunlight as an energy
   source. The microalgae can be used to produce biofuels, co-fired with
   high yielding fuels (like coke) or just recycled back into the anaerobic
   digestion cycle as a substrate for methane production. Overall, this
   process would allow, at least in principle, the conversion of all the
   carbon in the municipal wastewaters into fuels. This study reports data
   on municipal wastewater generation and treatment facilities across the
   globe. The focus is then given to sewage generation and treatment in
   Indian cities, classified into metropolitan, Class-I and Class-II
   cities. Aerobic and anaerobic digestion processes for sewage treatment
   are then compared with a discussion on the advantages of the anaerobic
   membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The advantages and limitations of
   photobioreactors for microalgae growth are discussed. Mass balances are
   then carried out with reference to sewage flows and concentrations in
   India, and the potential energy generation from the process is
   estimated. Overall, the complete process is envisaged to produce about
   1.69*108 kWhd-1 of energy from biogas and microalgae. This has the
   potential to replace 3% of the recent total petroleum product
   consumption in India. The study goes towards "zero discharge" of waste
   to the environment, thus representing a promising sustainable
   development.

AB In Europe, 2.52 kg nitrogen and 0.51 kg phosphorous/inhabitant/year are
   discharged in wastewater. Conventional biological and chemical methods
   for wastewater treatment are costly and not fully efficient in removing
   nutrients, and the discharge of effluents in rivers and lakes enhances
   the eutrophication. The use of microalgae species to remove nutrients
   available in wastewater, as a sustainable and low-cost treatment option,
   and also the use of different systems for algal cultivation in
   wastewater, aiming to obtain biomass and bio-products, is a growing
   field of research. Green microalgae, especially Chlorella species, play
   an important role in wastewater treatment while producing algal biomass,
   with numerous studies proving the high potential of Chlorella to consume
   nutrients from different categories of wastewater: municipal wastewater,
   wastewater from agriculture, wastewater from zootechnics, industrial
   wastewater. Cultivated in autotrophic, heterotrophic or mixotrophic
   conditions, in open or closed systems, microalgae have an important role
   in reducing greenhouse gases, consuming 1.83 kg CO2/kg dry algal
   biomass. Algal biomass can be capitalized to obtain many value-added
   products, including biofuels. The aim of this study is to review the
   advances in the utilization of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris in the
   treatment of municipal and zootechnical wastewater, emphasizing the
   removal of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).

AB Resource recovery from piggery biogas slurry has become an inevitable
   demand for sustainable development of pig industry. Microalgae show
   great potential in recovering nitrogen and phosphorus from piggery
   slurry, but struggle to utilize organic pollutants, as most of them are
   inert components (e.g., humic acids, HAs). In this study, nano-TiO2 was
   used to enhance the utilization of HAs by microalgae from piggery biogas
   slurry. Results showed that the optimal conditions for microalgal growth
   and HAs removal by the microalgae-TiO2 coupling system were TiO2 dosage
   of 0.30 g/L, microalgal inoculation concentration of 0.40 g/L, light
   intensity of 360 mol photon/(m2.s) and temperature of 30°C, with the
   microalgal chlorophyll concentration of 6.51 mg/L and HAs removal
   efficiency of 50.14%. Analysis of HAs composition variations in the
   piggery biogas slurry indicated that the decrease of HAs was caused by
   their decomposition into small molecules under the photocatalytic
   reactions of TiO2.

AB Recycling bioresources is the only way to sustainably meet a growing
   world population's food and energy needs. One of the ways to do so is by
   using agro-industry wastewater to cultivate microalgae. While the
   industrial production of microalgae requires large volumes of water,
   existing agro-industry processes generate large volumes of wastewater
   with eutrophicating nutrients and organic carbon that must be removed
   before recycling the water back into the environment. Coupling these two
   processes can benefit the flourishing microalgal industry, which
   requires water, and the agro-industry, which could gain extra revenue by
   converting a waste stream into a bioproduct. Microalgal biomass can be
   used to produce energy, nutritional biomass, and specialty products.
   However, there are challenges to establishing stable and circular
   processes, from microalgae selection and adaptation to pretreating and
   reclaiming energy from residues. This review discusses the potential of
   agro-industry residues for microalgal production, with a particular
   interest in the composition and the use of important primary (raw) and
   secondary (digestate) effluents generated in large volumes: sugarcane
   vinasse, palm oil mill effluent, cassava processing waster, abattoir
   wastewater, dairy processing wastewater, and aquaculture wastewater. It
   also overviews recent examples of microalgae production in residues and
   aspects of process integration and possible products, avoiding
   xenobiotics and heavy metal recycling. As virtually all agro-industries
   have boilers emitting CO2that microalgae can use, and many industries
   could benefit from anaerobic digestion to reclaim energy from the
   effluents before microalgal cultivation, the use of gaseous effluents is
   also discussed in the text.

AB Large-scale production of renewable biofuels through microbiological
   processes has drawn significant attention in recent years, mostly due to
   the increasing concerns on the petroleum fuel shortages and the
   environmental consequences of the over-utilization of petroleum-based
   fuels. In addition to native biofuel-producing microbes that have been
   employed for biofuel production for decades, recent advances in
   metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have made it possible to
   produce biofuels in several non-native biofuel-producing microorganisms.
   Compared to native producers, these non-native systems carry the
   advantages of fast growth, simple nutrient requirements, readiness for
   genetic modifications, and even the capability to assimilate CO2 and
   solar energy, making them competitive alternative systems to further
   decrease the biofuel production cost. However, the tolerance of these
   non-native microorganisms to toxic biofuels is naturally low, which has
   restricted the potentials of their application for high-efficiency
   biofuel production. To address the issues, research have been recently
   conducted to explore the biofuel tolerance mechanisms and to construct
   robust high-tolerance strains for non-native biofuel-producing
   microorganisms. In this review, we critically summarize the recent
   progress in this area, focusing on three popular non-native
   biofuel-producing systems, i.e. Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus and
   photosynthetic cyanobacteria.

AB Discharge of untreated domestic and industrial wastewater into aquatic
   bodies is posing a serious eutrophication threat, leading to a slow
   degradation of the water resources. A number of physical, chemical and
   biological methods have been developed for the treatment of wastewaters;
   among these, the use of microalgae is considered as a more eco-friendly
   and economical approaches. Microalgae are versatile organisms which
   perform multiple roles in the environment - bioremediation of
   wastewater, gleaning of excess nutrients and in turn, generate valuable
   biomass which finds applications in the food, biofuel and pharmaceutical
   industries. They are currently being utilized to reduce the high
   nutrient load (especially N and P) from wastewaters, which fulfill the
   growth requirements of microalgae, making it a suitable cultivation
   medium for biomass production. The present review represents a
   comprehensive compilation of reports on microalgal diversity of
   wastewaters, followed by a critical overview of their utilization,
   suitability and potential in bioremediation vis-a-vis biomass
   production. This review also emphasizes the superiority of polyalgal and
   consortial approaches in wastewater treatment, as compared to the use of
   unialgal inocula, besides providing useful pointers for future research
   needs in this area.

AB Background: Oleaginous microalgae are promising production hosts for the
   sustainable generation of lipid-based bioproducts and as bioenergy
   carriers such as biodiesel. Transcriptomics of the lipid accumulation
   phase, triggered efficiently by nitrogen starvation, is a valuable
   approach for the identification of gene targets for metabolic
   engineering. Results: An explorative analysis of the detailed
   transcriptional response to different stages of nitrogen availability
   was performed in the oleaginous green algaMonoraphidium neglectum.
   Transcript data were correlated with metabolic data for cellular
   contents of starch and of different lipid fractions. A pronounced
   transcriptional down-regulation of photosynthesis became apparent in
   response to nitrogen starvation, whereas glucose catabolism was found to
   be up-regulated. An in-depth reconstruction and analysis of the pathways
   for glycerolipid, central carbon, and starch metabolism revealed that
   distinct transcriptional changes were generally found only for specific
   steps within a metabolic pathway. In addition to pathway analyses, the
   transcript data were also used to refine the current genome annotation.
   The transcriptome data were integrated into a database and complemented
   with data for other microalgae which were also subjected to nitrogen
   starvation. It is available at https://tdbmn.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de.
   Conclusions: Based on the transcriptional responses to different stages
   of nitrogen availability, a model for triacylglycerol and lipid
   hyperaccumulation is proposed, which involves transcriptional induction
   of thioesterases, differential regulation of lipases, and a re-routing
   of the central carbon metabolism. Over-expression of distinct
   thioesterases was identified to be a potential strategy to increase the
   oleaginous phenotype ofM. neglectum, and furthermore specific lipases
   were identified as potential targets for future metabolic engineering
   approaches.

AB With impending climate change and ever decreasing supplies of easily
   extractable fossil fuel, means to produce renewable and sustainable
   replacement fuels are being sought. Plants or algae appear ideal since
   they can use sunlight to fix CO2 into usable fuel or fuel feedstocks.
   However, as the world population approaches the 1010 (10 billion) mark,
   the use of agricultural land to produce fuel instead of food cannot be
   justified. Microalgal biofuel production is under intense investigation
   due to its promise as a sustainable, renewable biofuel that can be
   produced using non-arable land and brackish or non-potable water. Some
   species accumulate high levels of TAGs (triacylglycerols) that can be
   converted to fatty acid esters suitable as replacement diesel fuels.
   However, there are many technical barriers to the practical application
   of microalgae for biofuel production and thus a number of significant
   challenges need to be met before microalgal biodiesel production becomes
   a practical reality. These include developing cost-effective cultivation
   strategies, low energy requiring harvesting technologies, and energy
   efficient and sustainable lipid conversion technologies. The large
   culture volumes that will be necessary dictate that the necessary
   nutrients come from wastewaters, such as the effluents from secondary
   treatment of sewage. Economical and energy sparing harvesting will
   require the development of novel flocculation or floatation strategies
   and new methods of oil extraction/catalysis that avoid the extensive use
   of solvents. Recent advances in these critical areas are reviewed and
   some of the possible strategies for moving forward are outlined.

AB Algal biofuels have received wide attention in recent years for its
   potential to reduce the dependence on conventional fossil fuels. Despite
   the portrayed advantages of high growth rate, carbon sequestration and
   waste remediation; large scale application of microalgal biofuels is
   still lacking because of the lower percentage of extractable lipids
   obtained from the harvested biomass. Thus, there is a substantial
   impetus to analyse the strategies for enhancing the lipid profile and
   yield to improve the microalgal biofuel quality as well as to reduce the
   costs incurred at field scale. Several biochemical and molecular
   strategies to increase the algal lipid accumulation has gained huge
   scientific interest in recent years and have opened up new avenues for
   algal biorefinery. However, the time and cost involved as well as the
   ecological risks associated with real-time applications often restricts
   their utilization. The present review gathers a compendium of the key
   milestones associated with the recent approaches of biochemical, genetic
   and metabolic engineering for lipid quantity and quality enhancement.
   Biochemical and engineering aspects of coercing the cells to
   environmental stress and altering the mode of nutrition has been
   elucidated. The advancements in genetic and metabolic engineering, the
   associated risk factors and the future perspectives have been
   highlighted. Strategic integration of the bioprocess and biomolecular
   techniques to explore its synergistic impact to rationally engineer
   microalgae with improved triacylglycerols has been emphasized.
   Assessment of the long term risks associated herewith can be used to
   avert the challenges, making algal biofuels a commercial reality in
   future.

AB Background: Microalgae have the potential to rapidly accumulate lipids
   of high interest for the food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and energy
   (e.g. biodiesel) industries. However, current lipid extraction methods
   show efficiency limitation and until now, extraction protocols have not
   been fully optimized for specific lipid compounds. The present study
   thus presents a novel lipid extraction method, consisting in the
   addition of a water treatment of biomass between the two-stage solvent
   extraction steps of current extraction methods. The resulting modified
   method not only enhances lipid extraction efficiency, but also yields a
   higher triacylglycerols (TAG) ratio, which is highly desirable for
   biodiesel production. Results: Modification of four existing methods
   using acetone, chloroform/methanol (Chl/Met), chloroform/methanol/H2O
   (Chl/Met/H2O) and dichloromethane/methanol (Dic/Met) showed respective
   lipid extraction yield enhancement of 72.3, 35.8, 60.3 and 60.9%. The
   modified acetone method resulted in the highest extraction yield, with
   68.90.2% DW total lipids. Extraction of TAG was particularly improved
   with the water treatment, especially for the Chl/Met/H2O and Dic/Met
   methods. The acetone method with the water treatment led to the highest
   extraction level of TAG with 73.77.3 g/mg DW, which is 130.810.6% higher
   than the maximum value obtained for the four classical methods (31.94.6
   g/mg DW). Interestingly, the water treatment preferentially improved the
   extraction of intracellular fractions, i.e. TAG, sterols, and free fatty
   acids, compared to the lipid fractions of the cell membranes, which are
   constituted of phospholipids (PL), acetone mobile polar lipids and
   hydrocarbons. Finally, from the 32 fatty acids analyzed for both neutral
   lipids (NL) and polar lipids (PL) fractions, it is clear that the water
   treatment greatly improves NL-to-PL ratio for the four standard methods
   assessed. Conclusion: Water treatment of biomass after the first solvent
   extraction step helps the subsequent release of intracellular lipids in
   the second extraction step, thus improving the global lipids extraction
   yield. In addition, the water treatment positively modifies the
   intracellular lipid class ratios of the final extract, in which TAG
   ratio is significantly increased without changes in the fatty acids
   composition. The novel method thus provides an efficient way to improve
   lipid extraction yield of existing methods, as well as selectively
   favoring TAG, a lipid of the upmost interest for biodiesel production.

AB Filamentous oleaginous microalgae specie Tribonema minus is a promising
   feedstock for biodiesel production. However, the metabolic mechanism of
   lipid production in this filamentous microalgal specie remains unclear.
   Here, we compared the lipid accumulation of T. minus at different growth
   phases, and described the de novo transcriptome sequencing and assembly
   and identified important pathways and genes involved in TAG production.
   Total lipid increased by 2.5-fold and its TAG level in total lipid
   reached 81.1% at stationary phase. Using the genes involved in the lipid
   metabolism, the TAG biosynthesis pathways were generated. Moreover,
   results also demonstrated that, in addition to the observed
   overexpression of the fatty acid synthesis pathway, TAG production at
   stationary growth phase was bolstered by repression of the
   beta-oxidation pathway, up-regulation of genes that funnels acetyl-CoA
   to lipid biosynthesis, especially gene encoding for
   phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) which funnels DAG to
   TAG biosynthesis.

AB The lack of tax incentives for biomethane use requires the optimization
   of both biogas production and upgrading in order to allow the full
   exploitation of this renewable energy source. The large number of
   biomethane contaminants present in biogas (CO2, H2S, H2O, N2, O2, methyl
   siloxanes, halocarbons) has resulted in complex sequences of upgrading
   processes based on conventional physical/chemical technologies capable
   of providing CH4 purities of 88-98% and H2S, halocarbons and methyl
   siloxane removals >99%. Unfortunately, the high consumption of energy
   and chemicals limits nowadays the environmental and economic
   sustainability of conventional biogas upgrading technologies. In this
   context, biotechnologies can offer a low cost and environmentally
   friendly alternative to physical/chemical biogas upgrading. Thus,
   biotechnologies such as H2-based chemoautrophic CO2 bioconversion to
   CH4, microalgae-based CO2 fixation, enzymatic CO2 dissolution,
   fermentative CO2 reduction and digestion with in situ CO2 desorption
   have consistently shown CO2 removals of 80-100% and CH4 purities of
   88-100%, while allowing the conversion of CO2 into valuable bio-products
   and even a simultaneous H2S removal. Likewise, H2S removals >99% are
   typically reported in aerobic and anoxic biotrickling filters,
   algal-bacterial photobioreactors and digesters under microaerophilic
   conditions. Even, methyl siloxanes and halocarbons are potentially
   subject to aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. However, despite these
   promising results, most biotechnologies still require further
   optimization and scale-up in order to compete with their
   physical/chemical counterparts. This review critically presents and
   discusses the state of the art of biogas upgrading technologies with
   special emphasis on biotechnologies for CO2, H2S, siloxane and
   halocarbon removal.

AB Microalgae can provide several different types of renewable biofuels.
   These include methane produced by anaerobic digestion of the algal
   biomass; biodiesel derived from microalgal oil and photobiologically
   produced biohydrogen. This review presents the current classification of
   biofuels, with special focus on microalgae and their applicability for
   the production of biodiesel. The paper considered issues related with
   the processing and culturing of microalgae, for not only those that are
   involved in biofuel production, but as well as the possibility of their
   utilization in environmental pollution control, especially with relation
   to greenhouse gas emissions and the process of sewage purification. The
   paper gives also a characterization of microalgae used in the production
   of biofuels and of their advantages relative to other raw materials used
   in fuel production.

AB Fuels from microalgae are being considered as important alternatives to
   fossil fuels. In this work we have identified challenges and
   opportunities for research in the production of energy from microalgae.
   The most important challenge facing this alternative resource is the
   energy generation efficiency (EGE) when microalgae are used for the
   generation of energy. EGE is about 35% for coal fired power plants while
   integrated gasification fuel cell cycle (IGFC) and advanced-IGFC
   (A-IGFC) have an efficiency of over 50%. Other challenges include,
   achieving a high titer of 2 g/l, a high lipid content of up to 30% and a
   high CO2 mass transfer efficiency. We observed that the process of
   energy generation from microalgae has good positive energy balance if
   the EGE can be improved to greater than 50% by developing IGFC/A-IGFC
   technologies. Other challenges come from energy spent in dewatering,
   loss of energy when solvents are recycled during the process of lipid
   extraction, use of energy in the form of methanol and energy used in
   recycling excess methanol if biodiesel is produced, and energy used in
   the production of nutrients, among others. Hence, future research must
   be targeted at minimizing the energy input in these processes.

U2 47
AB The scientific evidence on applications of microalgae in bioremediation
   of wastewaters, increasing agricultural productivity, and biomass
   production strengthens their potential in supporting global
   socio-economic and environmental sustainability. Microalgae can consume
   organic compounds and pollutants present in domestic, agricultural, and
   industrial wastewater. This leads to biomass production in wastewater
   and water being relatively safe to be disposed of into water bodies and
   safeguard life in water. The extensive diversity of microalgae,
   encompassing a distinct array of physiological, reproductive, and
   functional traits, along with their remarkable efficiency in wastewater
   treatment, positions this group of organisms as exceptionally superior
   to other organisms. Molecular and biotechnological approaches have
   provided promising tools for improving the biomass production of
   microalgae from wastewater. Recent technological innovations have
   facilitated harvesting algal biomass from wastewater treatment plants
   for developing a range of bioproducts like bioenergy, biofertilizer and
   other various high value biochemicals. Microalgal communities and their
   biomass produced from wastewater are investigated for the restoration of
   degraded lands. The potential use of diverse microalgal species and
   their biomass from wastewater for restoration of degraded lands such as
   salt-affected lands, drought ridden arid areas, fly ash contaminated
   lands, and metal-polluted mine spoils is discussed. Moreover, this
   review elaborates on how use of microalgae from wastewater to wastelands
   can contribute to various sustainable development goals (SDGs). It is
   found that extending microalgae research and use from wastewater to
   wastelands can support achieving all SDGs by directly contributing to 10
   goals.

TI Screening of freshwater oleaginous microalgae from South China and its
   cultivation characteristics in energy grass digestate.
SO Journal of Cleaner Production
VL 276
PY 2020
U1 12
U2 56
AB Microalgae biodiesel attracts considerable attention from energy
   organizations around the world. Lack of high oil-producing oleaginous
   microalgae is considered as one of the main bottlenecks for large-scale
   production of microalgae biodiesel. To address this issue, a nitrogen
   limitation-based method for screening oleaginous microalgae using
   24-well plates was developed in the present study. Thirty microalgae
   strains collected from a subtropical freshwater system of South China
   were selected and cultivated in bubbling column photobioreactors, with
   lipid yields as the endpoints. The dry weight (DW) of seven strains
   exceeded 6.0 g L-1 and total lipid contents of 10 strains were over 40%
   DW. Coelastrella sp. GN12 was further evaluated as it had the highest
   lipid yield (4.94 g L-1) and abundant triacylglycerol (95% total lipid).
   This strain was cultured in various digestates from mono-digested energy
   grass diluted with BG-11. A ratio of 25% energy grass digestate: BG-11
   (v: v) (designated as EG25) and a pure unsterilized energy grass
   digestate (designated as EG100U) were the most effective at growth and
   oil accumulation (with total lipid content > 50% DW). Total nitrogen
   removal rates of EG25 and EG100U were 73% and 57%, respectively, and the
   strain was even more effective at removing total phosphorus (96% and
   94%, respectively). Therefore, energy grass digestate can be used as a
   substitute medium for GN12, transforming waste into valuable energy
   sources and achieving the benefits of resource recycling and clean
   energy production.

   biodiesel production.
SO Water Research (Oxford)
VL 251
PY 2024
U1 66
U2 310
AB Waste activated sludge (WAS) as one of the major pollutants with a
   significant annual production, has garnered significant attention
   regarding its treatment and utilization. If improperly discharged, it
   not only caused environmental pollution but also led to the wastage of
   valuable resources. In this study, the microalgae growth and lipid
   accumulation using waste activated sludge extracts (WASE) under
   different temperature conditions were investigated. The highest lipid
   content (59.13%) and lipid productivity (80.41 mg L-1 d-1) were obtained
   at cultivation temperatures of 10 and 25°C, respectively. It was found
   that microalgae can effectively utilize TN/TP/NH4+-N and other nutrients
   of WASE. The highest utilization rates of TP, TN and NH4+-N were
   achieved at a cultivation temperature of 10°C, reaching 84.97, 77.49 and
   92.32%, respectively. The algal fatty acids had carbon chains
   predominantly ranging from C14 to C18, making them suitable for
   biodiesel production. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of
   transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed up-regulation of genes
   associated with triglyceride assembly, the antioxidant system of algal
   cells, and cellular autophagy, as well as the accumulation of
   metabolites related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and lipids.
   This study offers novel insights into the microscopic mechanisms of
   microalgae culture using WASE and approaches for the resource
   utilization of sludge.

AB Cyanobacteria have gained a lot of attention in recent years because of
   their potential applications in biotechnology. We present an overview of
   the literature describing the uses of cyanobacteria in industry and
   services sectors and provide an outlook on the challenges and future
   prospects of the field of cyanobacterial biotechnology. Cyanobacteria
   have been identified as a rich source of biologically active compounds
   with antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities.
   Several strains of cyanobacteria were found to accumulate
   polyhydroxyalkanoates, which can be used as a substitute for
   nonbiodegradable petrochemical-based plastics. Recent studies showed
   that oil-polluted sites are rich in cyanobacterial consortia capable of
   degrading oil components. Cyanobacteria within these consortia
   facilitated the degradation processes by providing the associated
   oil-degrading bacteria with the necessary oxygen, organics and fixed
   nitrogen. Cyanobacterial hydrogen has been considered as a very
   promising source of alternative energy, and has now been made
   commercially available. In addition to these applications, cyanobacteria
   are also used in aquaculture, wastewater treatment, food, fertilizers,
   production of secondary metabolites including exopolysaccharides,
   vitamins, toxins, enzymes and pharmaceuticals. Future research should
   focus on isolating new cyanobacterial strains producing high value
   products and genetically modifying existing strains to ensure maximum
   production of the desired products. Metagenomic libraries should be
   constructed to discover new functional genes that are involved in the
   biosynthesis of biotechnological relevant compounds. Large-scale
   industrial production of the cyanobacterial products requires
   optimization of incubation conditions and fermenter designs in order to
   increase productivity.

AB Microalgae are promising sustainable resources because of their ability
   to convert CO2 into biofuels and chemicals directly. However, the
   industrial production and economic feasibility of microalgal bioproducts
   are still limited. As such, metabolic engineering approaches have been
   undertaken to enhance the productivities of microalgal bioproducts. In
   the last decade, impressive advances in microalgae metabolic engineering
   have been made by developing genetic engineering tools and multi-omics
   analysis. This review presents comprehensive microalgal metabolic
   pathways and metabolic engineering strategies for producing lipids, long
   chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids, terpenoids, and carotenoids.
   Additionally, promising metabolic engineering approaches specific to
   target products are summarized. Finally, this review discusses current
   challenges and provides future perspectives for the effective production
   of chemicals and fuels via microalgal metabolic engineering.

AB Renewable energy is one of the key issues for sustainable development.
   Compared with alcohols and esters, alkanes - with the highest energy
   density - are a better liquid fuel. In this study, we focused on
   medium-chain alkanes, the main compounds of jet fuels. To control the
   chain length of alkanes, a chain length specific thioesterase from
   Umbellularia californica, a fatty acyl-CoA reductase Acinetobacter sp.
   M-1 that prefers lauroyl-CoA and myristoyl-CoA, and a decarbonylase from
   Nostoc punctiforme were engineering into Escherichia coli cells. The
   combination of genes, which determines the chain length of products, was
   carefully designed to control the product spectrum. Undecane and
   tridecane were produced with a concentration of 2.210.18 and 1.830.12
   mg.g-1, respectively. A total of 4.010.43 mg.g-1 pentadecane was also
   detected in the final products. The results showed the feasibility to
   use microorganisms as cell factories for alkane production. The product
   spectrum revealed that the chosen genes played a key role in the
   production of chain length specific alkanes.

AB Combining anaerobic digestion with microalgae cultivation has been
   increasingly explored as an environmentally-sustainable means of energy
   recovery and nutrient removal from biogas slurry (BS); however, due to
   the unique characteristic of BS (i.e., its high chemical oxygen demand
   (COD); high ammonium, total phosphate (TP), and total nitrogen (TN)
   content; high turbidity; and heavy metal content), significant
   challenges to large-scale application existed, including potential
   negative interactions among BS components and microalgae. This review
   identifies several physicochemical characteristics of BS that inhibit
   microalgae growth and, thereby, affect both BS remediation and
   microalgae biomass production. The potential inhibition of algal growth
   by heavy metals is also discussed, and progress in the pretreatment of
   BS for microalgae cultivation is examined.

AB There is an urgent need to develop sustainable solutions to convert
   solar energy into energy carriers used in the society. In addition to
   solar cells generating electricity, there are several options to
   generate solar fuels. This paper outlines and discusses the design and
   engineering of photosynthetic microbial systems for the generation of
   renewable solar fuels, with a focus on cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are
   prokaryotic microorganisms with the same type of photosynthesis as
   higher plants. Native and engineered cyanobacteria have been used by us
   and others as model systems to examine, demonstrate, and develop
   photobiological H2 production. More recently, the production of
   carbon-containing solar fuels like ethanol, butanol, and isoprene have
   been demonstrated. We are using a synthetic biology approach to develop
   efficient photosynthetic microbial cell factories for direct generation
   of biofuels from solar energy. Present progress and advances in the
   design, engineering, and construction of such cyanobacterial cells for
   the generation of a portfolio of solar fuels, e.g., hydrogen, alcohols,
   and isoprene, are presented and discussed. Possibilities and challenges
   when introducing and using synthetic biology are highlighted.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) of algal-bacterial biomass grown on wastewater
   has been used successfully for bio-methane production. However,
   challenges with AD of microalgae include inhibition due to accumulation
   of free ammonia (FA) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alkalinity
   depletion, and/or pH outside optimal values. In this study,
   algal-bacterial biomass was cultured on high-strength wastewater and
   then co-digested with sugarcane bagasse, an agricultural waste product
   that is widely available in tropical regions of the world. Biochemical
   methane potential (BMP) assays were set up at approximately 2% solids
   content with varying ratios of algal-bacterial biomass and sugarcane
   bagasse and varying substrate to inoculum ratios (S/I). Although methane
   content of biogas was similar in all digestion sets (61-67%),
   co-digestion sets with algae and bagasse produced higher methane yields
   (145 and 101 mL CH4/g VS) than algae alone (61 and 82 mL CH4/g VS) or
   bagasse alone (74 mL CH4/g VS). A significant correlation (r2 = 0.88, p
   = 0.012) was observed between algal-bacterial biomass content of the
   substrate and total gas production and therefore methane yield.
   Environmental conditions, including pH, alkalinity, total ammonia
   nitrogen (TAN), and VFA concentrations, were in the favorable range in
   all BMPs. However, co-digestion BMPs had greater initial release of COD,
   VFA, and TAN and greater VS reduction, indicating enhanced
   biodegradability of the substrates. Additional research is needed on the
   potential for using waste resources, such as wastewater and agricultural
   residuals, for biogas production in tropical regions.

AB Green algae have been and are being studied because of their commercial
   importance as a source of essential amino acids, vitamins, fatty acids
   and proteins. Most cultural systems today are open ponds. In Europe,
   Poland has beneficial conditions for broad geothermal use, with one of
   the renewable and sustainable energy sources. Romania has a remarkable
   potential in terms of geothermal energy, being considered, after Greece
   and Italy, as having great opportunities to use geothermal resources.
   Only one city in the country, city of Beius, relies entirely on this
   type of heating energy for homes and has important projects to become a
   true geothermal ecological center. In the present study, geothermal
   water could be used to prepare the microalgal culture surrounding to
   heat greenhouses used to grow algae, and to dry the biomass obtained.
   The use of geothermal water offers the possibility of producing algae in
   open ponds covered with greenhouses and plant cultivation in winter. The
   obtained algae can be used for the production of bio-products, biogas,
   algae biodiesel, with potential for application in plant cultivation.

AB Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are highly reduced energy storage molecules
   ideal for biodiesel production. Microalgal TAG biosynthesis has been
   studied extensively in recent years, both at the molecular level and
   systems level through experimental studies and computational modeling.
   However, discussions of the strategies and products of the experimental
   and modeling approaches are rarely integrated and summarized together in
   a way that promotes collaboration among modelers and biologists in this
   field. In this review, we outline advances toward understanding the
   cellular and molecular factors regulating TAG biosynthesis in
   unicellular microalgae with an emphasis on recent studies on
   rate-limiting steps in fatty acid and TAG synthesis, while also
   highlighting new insights obtained from the integration of multi-omics
   datasets with mathematical models. Computational methodologies such as
   kinetic modeling, metabolic flux analysis, and new variants of flux
   balance analysis are explained in detail. We discuss how these methods
   have been used to simulate algae growth and lipid metabolism in response
   to changing culture conditions and how they have been used in
   conjunction with experimental validations. Since emerging evidence
   indicates that TAG synthesis in microalgae operates through coordinated
   crosstalk between multiple pathways in diverse subcellular destinations
   including the endoplasmic reticulum and plastids, we discuss new
   experimental studies and models that incorporate these findings for
   discovering key regulatory checkpoints. Finally, we describe tools for
   genetic manipulation of microalgae and their potential for future
   rational algal strain design. This comprehensive review explores the
   potential synergistic impact of pathway analysis, computational
   approaches, and molecular genetic manipulation strategies on improving
   TAG production in microalgae.

AB A challenge in algae-based bio-oil production is to simultaneously
   enhance specific growth rates and specific lipid content. We have
   demonstrated simultaneous increases in both the above inChlorella
   vulgaristhrough reactive species (RS) induced under ultraviolet (UV) A
   and UVB light treatments. We postulated that the changes in photosystem
   (PS) stoichiometry and antenna size were responsible for the increases
   in specific growth rate. UVB treatment excited PSII, which resulted in a
   twofold to sevenfold increase in PSII/PSI ratio compared to control. An
   excited PSII caused a 2.7-fold increase in the specific levels of
   superoxide and a twofold increase in the specific levels of hydroxyl
   radicals. We have established that the increased specific intracellular
   RS (si-RS) levels increased the PSII antenna size by a significant
   10-fold as compared to control. In addition, the 8.2-fold increase in
   specific lipid content was directly related to the si-RS levels. We have
   also demonstrated that the RS induced under UVA treatment led to a
   3.2-fold increase in the saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio.
   Based on the findings, we have proposed and demonstrated a UV-based
   strategy, which achieved an 8.8-fold increase in volumetric lipid
   productivity.

AB Microalgae have great potential as biofactories for producing a wide
   variety of valuable products. Under stress conditions, it is well-known
   that microalgae accumulate various organic compounds. However, there is
   little information on the response of the diatomChaetoceros muellerito
   different nitrogen concentrations. In the present study,C. muelleriwas
   grown in medium containing different concentrations of nitrogen (NaNO3;
   f: 1.76 mM, f/4: 0.44 mM, f/10: 0.18 mM, and 2f: 3.53 mM) and their
   proximal composition, fatty acid profile, and gene expression
   (AMT1,PTD9,GltD,DGAT2, andNRT2) compared. The results showed no
   significant differences in biomass content among nitrogen treatments.
   Treatment f/10 significantly increased accumulation of lipids and
   carbohydrates but lowered the concentration of proteins. This treatment
   also produced shorter-chain fatty acids and a low percentage of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids, demonstrating the potential of this medium
   for growing microalgae with a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel
   production. Furthermore,DGAT2andNRT2expression was highest at lower
   nitrogen concentrations, suggesting these genes could be important for
   modulating lipid biosynthesis in response to nitrogen limitation.

AB Greenhouse effect, water resource crisis and energy crisis are the three

   Microalgae, as a kind of aquatic plant, have become a hot global
   research topic in the field of CO2 emission reduction, wastewater
   ecological recovery and biological energy. The application research
   progress in using microalgae in the field of CO2 biological trapping and
   wastewater ecological recovery is summarized. Based on microalgal
   biological processes research concentrating on optimum design of one
   unit and lacking of fully cognition toward the importance of
   interconnection, The conception of coupling these factors are putted
   forward. The new biofuel strategy is biodiesel production of high oil
   content microalgae coupled with wastewater treatment and flue gas, then
   algal residue and coal both vaporize. Efficient global optimization and
   environmental comprehensive control is important. To develop low carbon
   economy is an effective way in China, The future research emphasis and
   prospect of microalgae interconnection are also mentioned.

AB Despite microalgae recently receiving enormous attention as a potential
   source of biodiesel, their use is still not feasible as an alternative
   to fossil fuels. Recently, interest in microalgae has focused on the
   production of bioactive compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids
   (PUFA), which provide microalgae a high added value. Several
   considerations need to be assessed for optimizing PUFA production from
   microalgae. Firstly, a microalgae species that produces high PUFA
   concentrations should be selected, such asNannochloropsis
   gaditana,Isochrysis galbana,Phaeodactylum tricornutum,
   andCrypthecodinium cohnii, with marine species gaining more attention
   than do freshwater species. Closed cultivation processes, e.g.,
   photobioreactors, are the most appropriate since temperature, pH, and
   nutrients can be controlled. An airlift column with LEDs or optical
   fibers to distribute photons into the culture media can be used at small
   scale to produce inoculum, while tubular and flat panels are used at
   commercial scale. Depending on the microalgae, a temperature range from
   15 to 28°C and a pH from 7 to 8 can be employed. Relevant conditions for
   PUFA production are medium light irradiances (50-300 mol photons
   m-2s-1), air enriched with (0-1% (v/v) CO2), as well as nitrogen and
   phosphorous limitation. For research purposes, the most appropriate
   medium for PUFA production is Bold's Basal, whereas mixotrophic
   cultivation using sucrose or glucose as the carbon source has been
   reported for industrial processes. For cell harvesting, the use of
   tangential flow membrane filtration or disk stack centrifugation is
   advisable at commercial scale. Current research on PUFA extraction have
   focused on the use of organic solvents assisted with ultrasound or
   microwaves, supercritical fluids, and electroporation or are enzyme
   assisted. Commercial-scale extraction involves mainly physical methods
   such as bead mills and expeller presses. All these factors should be
   taken into account when choosing a PUFA production system, as discussed
   in this review.

AB Using genetically modified cyanobacterial strains, we engineered a Green
   Recovery strategy to convert membrane lipids into fatty acids for
   economical and environmentally sustainable biofuel production. The Green
   Recovery strategy utilizes lipolytic enzymes under the control of
   promoters induced by CO2 limitation. Data indicate that strains of the
   cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 engineered for Green Recovery
   underwent degradation of membrane diacylglycerols upon CO2 limitation,
   leading to release of fatty acids into the culture medium. Recovered
   fatty acid yields of 36.1*10-12 mg/cell were measured in one of the
   engineered strains (SD239). Green Recovery can be incorporated into
   previously constructed fatty-acid-secretion strains, enabling fatty acid
   recovery from the remaining cyanobacterial biomass that will be
   generated during fatty acid biofuel production in photobioreactors.

AB Microalgae represent an exceptionally diverse but highly specialized
   group of micro-organisms adapted to various ecological habitats. Many
   microalgae have the ability to produce substantial amounts (e.g. 20-50%
   dry cell weight) of triacylglycerols (TAG) as a storage lipid under
   photo-oxidative stress or other adverse environmental conditions. Fatty
   acids, the building blocks for TAGs and all other cellular lipids, are
   synthesized in the chloroplast using a single set of enzymes, of which
   acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) is key in regulating fatty acid
   synthesis rates. However, the expression of genes involved in fatty acid
   synthesis is poorly understood in microalgae. Synthesis and
   sequestration of TAG into cytosolic lipid bodies appear to be a
   protective mechanism by which algal cells cope with stress conditions,
   but little is known about regulation of TAG formation at the molecular
   and cellular level. While the concept of using microalgae as an
   alternative and renewable source of lipid-rich biomass feedstock for
   biofuels has been explored over the past few decades, a scalable,
   commercially viable system has yet to emerge. Today, the production of
   algal oil is primarily confined to high-value specialty oils with
   nutritional value, rather than commodity oils for biofuel. This review
   provides a brief summary of the current knowledge on oleaginous algae
   and their fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis, algal model systems and
   genomic approaches to a better understanding of TAG production, and a
   historical perspective and path forward for microalgae-based biofuel
   research and commercialization.

U1 5
U2 36
AB Research on renewable energy from microalgae has led to a growing
   interest in porous substrate photobioreactors, but their widespread
   adoption is currently limited to pure microalgal biofilm cultures. The
   behavior of microalgal-bacterial biofilms immobilized on microporous
   substrates remains as a research challenge, particularly in uncovering
   their mutualistic interactions in environment enriched with dissolved
   organic matter. Therefore, this study established a novel culture
   platform by introducing microalgal-derived bio-coating that
   preconditioned hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride membranes for the
   microalgal-bacterial biofilm growth of freshwater microalgae,Chlorella
   vulgarisESP 31 and marine microalgae,Cylindrotheca fusiformiswith
   bacteria,Escherichia coli. In the attached co-culture mode, the
   bio-coating we proposed demonstrated the ability to enhance microalgal
   growth for both studied species by a range of 2.5% to 19% starting from
   day 10 onwards. Additionally, when compared to co-culture on uncoated
   membranes, the bio-coating exhibited a significant bacterial growth
   promotion effect, increasing bacterial growth by at least 2.35 times for
   theC. vulgaris-E. colico-culture after an initial adaptation phase. A
   significant increase of at least 72% in intracellular biochemical
   compounds (including chlorophyll, polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids)
   was observed within just five days, primarily due to the high
   concentration of pre-coated organic matter, mainly sourced from the
   internal organic matter (IOM) ofC. fusiformis.Higher accumulation of
   organic compounds in the bio-coating indirectly triggers a competition
   between microalgae and bacteria which potentially stimulate the
   production of additional intra-/extra-organic substances as a defensive
   response. In short, insight gained from this study may represent a
   paradigm shift in the ways that symbiotic interactions are promoted to
   increase the yield of specific bio-compounds with the presence of
   bio-coating.

AB Photosynthetic hydrogen (H2) production by green algae has fascinated
   biologists and energy experts, due to the potential application of this
   process for renewable energy. In this study, H2 photoproduction and PSII
   photochemical activities were investigated in Chlorella sorokiniana
   exposed to simultaneous nitrogen limitation and sulfur (S-) and/or
   phosphorus (P-) deprivation. Under S-deprivation, C. sorokiniana
   produced about 48.2 mL L-1 of H2. Moreover, simultaneous nitrogen
   limitation (0.7 mM NH4Cl) and sulfur- and/or phosphorus-deprivation
   significantly increased H2 production of C. sorokiniana over that of
   S-deprivation alone. Maximum H2 outputs of 77.3, 98.1 and 125.1 mL L-1
   were obtained in the N-limited cultures exposed to P-deprivation
   (TAP-P), S-deprivation (TAP-S) and simultaneous S- and P-deprivation
   (TAP-S-P), respectively. The average rate of H2 production for the
   N-limited culture exposed to TAP-P, TAP-S and TAP-S-P was 1.07, 1.36 and
   1.50 mL L-1 h-1, respectively. Interestingly, the H2 inducement time in
   the culture subjected to simultaneous N-limitation and S- and/or
   P-deprivation was much shorter than that of traditional S-deprivation.
   The photosynthetic inhibitors, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea
   (DCMU) and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropylp-benzoquinone (DBMIB)
   repressed H2 production in TAP-S-P (0.7 mM NH4Cl) medium by 68.04% and
   98.65%, respectively. The conditions of simultaneous N-limitation, S-
   and P-deprivation provided another efficient method for inducing H2
   production in C. sorokiniana. In addition, we also found that two-thirds
   of the required electrons were generated from the splitting of H2O in
   PSII and that the remaining one-third possibly came from some other
   substrate catabolism.

AB Ultrasonication has recently received attention as a novel bioprocessing
   tool for process intensification in many areas of downstream processing.
   Ultrasonic intensification (periodic ultrasonic treatment during the
   fermentation process) can result in a more effective homogenization of
   biomass and faster energy and mass transfer to biomass over short time
   periods which can result in enhanced microbial growth. Ultrasonic
   intensification can allow the rapid selective extraction of specific
   biomass components and can enhance product yields which can be of
   economic benefit. This review focuses on the role of ultrasonication in
   the extraction and yield enhancement of compounds from various microbial
   sources, specifically algal and cyanobacterial biomass with a focus on
   the production of biofuels. The operating principles associated with the
   process of ultrasonication and the influence of various operating
   conditions including ultrasonic frequency, power intensity, ultrasonic
   duration, reactor designs and kinetics applied for ultrasonic
   intensification are also described.

   This review gives an insight into solving multiple problems using a
   nano-biorefinery approach in conjugation with wastewater treatment. The
   major advantage of using a bio-derivative method in nanoparticle
   synthesis is its low toxicity towards the environment. The current
   review discusses the development of nanoscience and its biogenic
   importance. It covers the usage of microalgae for (A) Nanoparticle's

   Nanoparticles in bio-refinery processes (D) Wastewater treatment with
   microalgae and bio-derived nanoparticles (E) A hypothetical mechanistic
   approach, which utilizes the photothermal effect of metallic
   nanoparticles to extract lipids from the cells without cell damage. The
   term "cell milking" has been around for quite some time, and the
   hypothesis discussed in the present study can help in this context. The

AB With petrol and gas prices soaring, people are looking for cheaper,
   renewable sources of fuel for their vehicles. Biodiesel fuel is used in
   diesel engines and is made from domestically available, renewable
   organic resources, such as vegetable oils and animals fats. Biodiesel
   fuel is used in diesel engines and is made from domestically available,
   renewable organic resources, such as vegetable oils and animal fats.
   Biodiesel burns cleaner (i.e. produces fewer emissions) than traditional
   petroleum diesel fuel and is biodegradable. Algae mainly microalgae have
   recently gained a lot of attention as a new biomass source for the
   production of renewable energy. Microalgae can provide several different
   types of renewable biofuel including methane produced by anaerobic
   digestion of the algal biomass, biodiesel derived from microalgal oil
   and photobiologically produced biohydrogen. The idea of using microalgae
   as a source of fuel is not new but is now being taken seriously because
   of the escalating prices of petroleum and more significantly, the
   emerging concern about global warming that is associated with burning
   fossil fuels. Biodiesel is produced currently from plant and animal oils
   but not from microalgae. Biodiesel is a proven fuel and it is
   technically feasible. It is the only renewable biodiesel that can
   potentially displace liquid fuels derived from petroleum. The conversion
   of the extracted algae lipids to biodiesel is relatively easy and the
   product price can easily be compared with fossil fuel prices. This
   review summarizes the advantages, fatty acid composition,
   transesterification, economically effective and efficient potential of
   algae for biofuel production.

AB The proficiency of microalgae to resist heavy metals has potential to be
   beneficial in resolving various environmental challenges. Global
   situations such as the need for cost-effective and ecological ways of
   remediation of contaminated water and for the development of bioenergy
   sources could employ microalgae. In a medium with the presence of heavy
   metals, microalgae utilize different mechanisms to uptake the metal and
   further detoxify it. Biosorption and the next process of bioaccumulation
   are two such major steps and they also include the assistance of
   different transporters at different stages of heavy metal tolerance.
   This capability has also proved to be efficient in eradicating many
   heavy metals like Chromium, Copper, Lead, Arsenic, Mercury, Nickel and
   Cadmium from the environment they are present in. This indicates the
   possibility of the application of microalgae as a biological way of
   remediating contaminated water. Heavy metal resistance quality also
   allows various microalgal species to contribute in the generation of
   biofuels like biodiesel and biohydrogen. Many research works have also
   explored the capacity of microalgae in nanotechnology for the formation
   of nanoparticles due to its relevant characteristics. Various studies
   have also revealed that biochar deduced from microalgae or a combination
   of biochar and microalgae can have wide applications specially in
   deprivation of heavy metals from an environment. This review focuses on
   the strategies adopted by microalgae, various transporters involved in
   the process of tolerating heavy metals and the applications where
   microalgae can participate owing to its ability to resist metals.

AB Microalgae are rich in fatty acids, proteins, and other nutrients, which
   have gained the general attention of researchers all over the world. For
   the development ofChlorella vulgarisin food and feed industry, this
   study was conducted to investigate the differences inC. vulgaris' growth
   and nutritional components under different culture conditions
   (autotrophic, heterotrophic, photoheterotrophic) and the internal
   factors through cell counting in combination with transcriptome and
   nutrient analyses. The results showed that, under the photoheterotrophic
   condition,Chlorella's growth and the contents of lipid and protein were
   significantly higher than that under the heterotrophic condition, and
   the moisture content was lower than that under the heterotrophic
   condition. The saturated fatty acid content under the photoheterotrophic
   condition was the lowest, while the polyunsaturated fatty acid content
   was significantly higher than those under the other two conditions.
   There were 46,583 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including
   33,039 up-regulated DEGs (70.93%) and 13,544 down-regulated DEGs
   (29.07%), under the photoheterotrophic condition in comparison with the
   autotrophic condition. The fold change between the two conditions of
   samples of up-regulated genes was higher than that of the down-regulated
   genes. The KEGG enrichment showed that the up-regulated DEGs in the
   photoheterotrophic condition were significantly enriched in 5 pathways,
   including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway,
   photosynthesis pathway, photosynthesis-antenna protein pathway,
   endocytosis pathway, and phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism pathway.
   DEGs related to fatty acid metabolic pathways were significantly
   enriched in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and the biosynthesis of
   unsaturated fatty acid pathway. The qPCR analysis showed that the
   expression pattern of the selected genes was consistent with that of
   transcriptome analysis. The results of this study lay a theoretical
   foundation for the large-scale production ofChlorellaand its application
   in food, feed, and biodiesel.

AB Microalgae are complex metabolic machineries whose potential has been
   continuously tapped for wide range of applications. Their suboptimal
   biomass yield and bioactives production remain the mainstay for their
   commercialization. To surpass the limitations, genetic engineering and
   its decisive role in strain improvement have led to the enhancement of
   quality and yield of products. Meanwhile, the sporadic use of genetic
   engineering tools specifically toward microalgal strains has limited
   their applicability. In this context, this article was mainly prepared
   to highlight the characteristics of microalgae and the introduction of
   omics approach for the improvement of strain for biorefinery processes.
   Furthermore, genome editing and gene-interfering tools to augment algal
   research using reference strains have been described. The progress made
   by genetic engineering in editing a gene using CRISPR-Cas9 and metabolic
   engineering of microalgae for biofuel production and CO2 sequestration
   have been critically reviewed. As a futuristic alternative, the
   transgenic microalgae would compete with the existing resources reducing
   the dependency on fossil fuel in terms of cost, energy production, and
   efficacy.

U1 5
U2 8
AB In recent years, the growing demand for algae in Western countries is
   due to their richness in nutrients and bioactive compounds, and their
   use as ingredients for foods, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, fertilizers,
   biofuels,, etc. Evaluation of the qualitative characteristics of algae
   involves assessing their physicochemical and nutritional components to
   determine their suitability for specific end uses, but this assessment
   is generally performed using destructive, expensive, and time-consuming
   traditional chemical analyses, and requires sample preparation. The
   hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique has been successfully applied in
   food quality assessment and control and has the potential to overcome
   the limitations of traditional biochemical methods. In this study, the
   nutritional profile (proteins, lipids, and fibers) of seventeen edible
   macro- and microalgae species widely grown throughout the world were
   investigated using traditional methods. Moreover, a shortwave infrared
   (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging device and artificial neural network (ANN)
   algorithms were used to develop multi-species models for proteins,
   lipids, and fibers. The predictive power of the models was characterized
   by different metrics, which showed very high predictive performances for
   all nutritional parameters (for example, R2= 0.9952, 0.9767, 0.9828 for
   proteins, lipids, and fibers, respectively). Our results demonstrated
   the ability of SWIR hyperspectral imaging coupled with ANN algorithms in
   quantifying biomolecules in algal species in a fast and sustainable way.

U1 0
U2 12
AB Microalgae has gathered significant interest as a promising feedstock
   for biocrude production through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL).
   However, the challenge of microalgae harvesting presents a significant
   obstacle to its economic viability and technical feasibility. This study
   aimed to overcome the complexities of microalgae harvesting processes by
   exploiting the self-settling characteristic of microalgaeScenedesmus
   obliquus(S. obliquus). The supernatant was discarded, and theS.
   obliquussolution was utilized as the processing medium for HTL of
   various types of biomass. HTL ofChlorella pyrenoidosa(C. pyrenoidosa)
   inS. obliquussolution at 300°C resulted in a synergistic increase in
   biocrude yield (approximately 10 wt%, daf); however, increasing the
   temperature to 350°C diminished the observed synergy. HTL of spent
   coffee grounds inS. obliquussolution generated 39.0 wt% (daf) and 45 wt%
   (daf) biocrude at 300°C and 350°C, respectively, with no synergistic
   effect observed. Conversely, macroalgaeEnteromorpha prolifera(E.
   prolifera) and sawdust, which had a high carbohydrate content, showed
   antagonistic effects on biocrude yield whenS. obliquussolution was used
   at high temperatures (350°C). These observations were further verified
   by carrying out HTL of carbohydrate model component inS.
   obliquussolution. Principal component analysis of product yields was
   performed in this study, and it revealed that HTL ofC. pyrenoidosa,
   protein, and lipid were significantly different from spent coffee
   grounds,E. prolifera, sawdust, and carbohydrate. Overall, depending on
   the feedstock used, the self-settlingS. obliquussolution could serve as
   a promising HTL processing medium for biocrude production, eliminating

AB Long-chain acyl-CoA reductases (ACRs) catalyze a key step in the
   biosynthesis of hydrocarbon waxes. As such they are attractive as
   components in engineered metabolic pathways for 'drop in' biofuels. Most
   ACR enzymes are integral membrane proteins, but a cytosolic ACR was
   recently discovered in cyanobacteria. The ACR from Synechococcus
   elongatus was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and
   characterized. The enzyme was specific for NADPH and catalyzed the
   reduction of fatty acyl-CoA esters to the corresponding aldehydes,
   rather than alcohols. Stearoyl-CoA was the most effective substrate,
   being reduced more rapidly than either longer or shorter chain
   acyl-CoAs. ACR required divalent metal ions, e.g. Mg2+, for activity and
   was stimulated 10-fold by K+. The enzyme was inactivated by
   iodoacetamide and was acylated on incubation with stearoyl-CoA,
   suggesting that reduction occurs through an enzyme-thioester
   intermediate. Consistent with this, steady state kinetic analysis
   indicates that the enzyme operates by a 'ping-pong' mechanism with
   kcat=0.360.023 min-1, Km (stearoyl-CoA)=31.94.2 M and Km (NADPH)=35.64.9
   M. The slow turnover number measured for ACR poses a challenge for its
   use in biofuel applications where highly efficient enzymes are needed.

AB Pretreatment of microalgal biomass possessing rigid cell wall is a
   critical step for enhancing the efficiency of microalgal biorefinery.
   However, the conventional pretreatment processes suffer the drawbacks of
   complex processing steps, long processing time, low conversion
   efficiency and high processing costs. This significantly hinders the
   industrial applicability of microalgal biorefinery. The innovative
   electricity-aid pretreatment techniques serve as a promising processing
   tool to extensively enhance the release of intracellular substances from
   microalgae. In this review, application of electric field-based
   techniques and recent advances of using electrical pretreatments on
   microalgae cell focusing on pulsed electric field, electrolysis, high
   voltage electrical discharges and moderate electric field are reviewed.
   In addition, the emerging techniques integrating electrolysis with
   liquid biphasic flotation process as promising downstream approach is
   discussed. This review delivers broad knowledge of the present
   significance of the application of these methods focusing on the
   development of electric assisted biomolecules extraction from
   microalgae.

AB The accumulation of storage lipids in oleaginous microalgae can be
   induced by a targeted nutrient limitation. Experiments with varying
   concentrations of nitrate in the culture medium showed differing
   volumetric productivities of Phaeodactylum tricornutum in batch
   experiments. This was partially attributable to the differentiated
   ability of cultures to absorb light. Apart from that, it was
   demonstrated that storage molecule accumulation follows kinetics that
   show saturation at high photon flux densities. The measurement of the
   photoconversion efficiency (PCE) based on a rigorous balancing of
   absorbed light energy and changes in the enthalpy of combustion of
   biomass during nutrient depletion. In batch experiments the PCE was
   increased more than twofold, from 2.48% at low nitrate concentrations to
   a maximum value of 5.65%, by increase of the nitrogen availability.

AB Filamentous cyanobacteria, such as Anabaena 7120 have great industrial
   potential due to their capability to be genetically engineered to
   produce next-generation biofuels while using minimal nutrients. One
   challenge of working with these microbes is that classical methods of
   quantifying cell viability are not effective due to their filamentous
   morphology. Therefore, fluorescent assays were evaluated to determine if
   they could be used as a reliable indicator of cell viability. Initially,
   a dual-stain assay using SYTO 9 and SYTOX Blue was investigated.
   Fluorescence from SYTO 9 was accurately correlated with viable cells;
   however, SYTOX Blue did not work as a non-viable cell indicator due to
   non-specific binding in both viable and non-viable cells.
   Autofluorescence from light harvesting pigments was also evaluated as a
   viable cell indicator, but unfortunately these pigments resulted in
   several emission peaks that couldn't be captured by a single emission
   filter. Moreover, certain light harvesting pigments continued to
   fluoresce after the cell became non-viable. SYTO 9 was then compared to
   absorbance and chlorophyll content to quantify viable Anabaena 7120 in a
   chemical inhibition testing protocol. This protocol requires a low
   initial biomass concentration to prevent binding of the chemicals to
   cell biomass, and at low cell densities SYTO 9 was superior to
   absorbance and chlorophyll content in quantifying viability. It was also
   determined that SYTO 9 allows for the evaluation of different
   cultivation media on the growth of cyanobacteria in photobioreactors.
   SYTO 9 is a reliable, accurate indicator of viability of filamentous
   cyanobacteria and can be used in a high-throughput manner via a
   microplate reader.

AB Isochrysis galbanais widely used in the aquaculture industry and is a
   potential industrial biodiesel producer. The growth ofI. galbanahas been
   enhanced in mixotrophic conditions with glycerol supplementation.
   Nevertheless, the effect mechanism of glycerol onI. galbanaremains
   unclear. This study aimed to reveal how glycerol supplementation (0.1%
   by volume fraction) altered the growth, photosynthesis, respiration,
   fatty acid profile and transcriptome ofI. galbana. Glycerol was shown to
   favor the growth ofI. galbanaunder light. The increase in oxygen uptake
   rate indicates that glycerol is involved in the respiratory carbon
   metabolism ofI. galbana. Furthermore, the added glycerol downregulated
   the photosynthetic activity of the alga, with a decrease in
   light-harvesting pigments, i.e., chlorophyllcand carotenoids, and a
   decrease in photosynthetic electron transfer activity as indicators. In
   addition, the fatty acid profile ofI. galbanawas affected by the
   supplementation of glycerol with a pronounced increase in oleic acid to
   36.47%. Meanwhile, the ratio of Sigma(saturated fatty acids +
   monounsaturated fatty acids)/Sigma(polyunsaturated fatty acids) in
   glycerol-treated samples (3.43) was significantly higher than that in
   control samples (2.13), indicating a better composition for biodiesel.
   Transcriptomic analysis further revealed the molecular mechanisms
   involved in the impacts of glycerol onI. galbana. DEGs enriched to
   photosynthesis, light harvesting, chlorophyll binding, and chloroplast
   thylakoid membrane were mainly downregulated, and the DEGs enriched in
   translation, nitrate transport, stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase activity were
   mainly upregulated, consistent with the results of photosynthesis,
   biomass and the fatty acid profile. This study demonstrated the
   essential role of 0.1% glycerol in accelerating the growth and altering
   the fatty acid profiles ofI. galbana, as well as the preliminary
   molecular mechanism underlying these physiological changes.

AB Microalgal biomass as bioenergy feedstock is gaining wide attention for
   biocrude production through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). However,
   the availability of feedstock in all seasons is a major challenge.
   Hence, to ensure a consistent supply of feedstock and transform waste to
   energy, the present study investigates co-HTL of domestic wastewater
   treatment derived microalgal biomass (Monoraphidium sp. KMC4) and
   domestic sewage sludge (DSS) as bioenergy feedstocks. The effects of
   temperature, feedstock ratio, and residence time were studied and
   optimised for maximum biocrude yield. The study showed that, co-HTL at
   optimum operating conditions of 325°C, 75:25 wt% (KMC4:DSS), and 45 min
   produced 39.38 wt% biocrude yield at a conversion rate of 83.96 wt%. The
   optimum biocrude yield was 16% and 79% higher than the individual HTL of
   KMC4 and DSS respectively. The comprehensive characterizations of co-HTL
   biocrude showed 76.77%, 10.6%, 8.85%, 3.38% of C, H, N, O and 39.47 MJ
   Kg-1 of HHV with an energy recovery rate of 77.53%. Meanwhile, co-HTL
   enhanced the distillation profile of biocrude which had 10.13% of heavy
   naphtha, 23.92% of kerosene, and 27.09% of gas oil. The FTIR and GC-MS
   analysis confirmed that the co-HTL biocrude had superior hydrocarbons
   such as alcohols and esters with limited nitrogen and oxygen
   heterocyclic compounds. In addition, ICP-AES confirmed a significant
   decrease in transfer of mineral elements from the co-HTL feedstock to
   biocrude. This validates the sustainability of the co-HTL process to
   produce high energy density biocrude with the potential to substitute
   fossil fuels.

AB Select groups of cyanobacteria and microalgae possess the ability to
   convert sun light into fuels by producing hydrogen from
   photosynthetically generated electrons and protons. This solar-powered
   biohydrogen production is low but can be improved, among others, by
   developing high rate hydrogen producing mutants. Cyanobacteria are the
   most promising systems for photobiological production of hydrogen, where
   hydrogen generation is catalysed either by the enzyme nitrogenase or by
   hydrogenase. We review the potentials of nitrogenase-based hydrogen
   production as it has the advantage of catalyzing unidirectional
   production of hydrogen. We also discuss the production of mutants of
   heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria with enhanced bio-hydrogen activity,
   and the design and development of sustainable low-cost oxyhydrogen
   biofuel cells using nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in enriched culture
   conditions.

AB The development and application of bioenergy and biofuels conversion
   technology can play a significant role for the production of renewable
   and sustainable energy sources in the future. However, the complexity of
   bioenergy systems and the limitations of human understanding make it
   difficult to build models based on experience or theory for accurate
   predictions. Recent developments in data science and machine learning
   (ML), can provide new opportunities. Accordingly, this critical review
   provides a deep insight into the application of ML in the bioenergy
   context. The latest advances in ML assisted bioenergy technology,
   including energy utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, microalgae
   cultivation, biofuels conversion and application, are reviewed in
   detail. The strengths and limitations of ML in bioenergy systems are
   comprehensively analysed. Moreover, we highlight the capabilities and
   potential of advanced ML methods when encountering multifarious tasks in
   the future prospects to advance a new generation of bioenergy and

AB Biohydrogen production (BHP) from biomass is a characteristic feature of
   prokaryotes and is considered to be a vital source of renewable energy.
   It is considered as the cleanest fuel with no emanation of greenhouse
   gases on ignition. The major biological processes for hydrogen (H2)
   production are: biophotolysis of water by algae and cyanobacteria, dark
   fermentation and photo-fermentation. For the past fifty years, lot of
   work has been carried out for understanding and improving BHP and still
   it has to overcome some of the serious limitations so that it becomes
   viable proposition. The bottlenecks include thermodynamic inefficiency,
   difficulty in using lignocellulosics as feed material, raw material cost
   and lower hydrogen yield. To overcome these major problems, the
   conventional approach is not enough and one has to vigorously think
   modern bioinformatics approaches to conquer them. The accessibility of
   huge sequenced genomes, functional genomics studies, the development of
   in silico models at the genome scale, metabolic pathway reconstruction,
   and synthetic biology approach predicts engineering strategies to
   enhance H2 production in an organism. This review investigates the
   recent status and advancements that have been made in the area of
   biotechnology and bioinformatics, to understand and enhance the H2
   generation to overcome current limitations and make biohydrogen, a
   reality in near future.

AB Background: The use of cyanobacteria and microalgae as cell factories to
   produce biofuels and added-value bioproducts has received great
   attention during the last two decades. Important investments have been
   made by public and private sectors to develop this field. However, it
   has been a challenge to develop a viable and cost-effective platform for
   cultivation of cyanobacteria and microalgae under outdoor conditions.
   Dealing with contamination caused by bacteria, weedy algae/cyanobacteria
   and other organisms is a major constraint to establish effective
   cultivation processes. Results: Here, we describe the implementation in
   the cyanobacteriumSynechococcus elongatusPCC 7942 of a phosphorus
   selective nutrition system to control biological contamination during
   cultivation. The system is based on metabolic engineering ofS.
   elongatusto metabolize phosphite, a phosphorus source not normally
   metabolized by most organisms, by expressing a bacterial phosphite
   oxidoreductase (PtxD). EngineeredS. elongatusstrains expressing PtxD
   grow at a similar rate on media supplemented with phosphite as the
   non-transformed control supplemented with phosphate. We show that when
   grown in media containing phosphite as the sole phosphorus source in
   glass flasks, the engineered strain was able to grow and outcompete
   biological contaminants even when the system was intentionally
   inoculated with natural competitors isolated from an irrigation canal.
   The PtxD/phosphite system was successfully used for outdoor cultivation
   of engineeredS. elongatusin 100-L cylindrical reactors and 1000-L
   raceway ponds, under non-axenic conditions and without the need of
   sterilizing containers and media. Finally, we also show that the
   PtxD/phosphite system can be used as selectable marker forS.
   elongatusPCC 7942 transgenic strains selection, eliminating the need of
   antibiotic resistance genes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the
   PtxD/phosphite system is a stable and sufficiently robust strategy to
   control biological contaminants without the need of sterilization or
   other complex aseptic procedures. Our data show that the PtxD/phosphite
   system can be used as selectable marker and allows production of the
   cyanobacteriumS. elongatusPCC 7942 in non-axenic outdoor reactors at
   lower cost, which in principle should be applicable to other
   cyanobacteria and microalgae engineered to metabolize phosphite.

U1 0

AB Microalgae lipids are a promising energy source, but current biochemical
   methods of lipid-inductions such as nitrogen deprivation have low
   process robustness and controllability. Recently, use of
   mechanotransduction based membrane distortion by applying compression
   stress in a 2D-microsystem was suggested as a way to overcome these
   limitations of biochemical induction. However, reproduction in large
   numbers of cells without cell death has been difficult to overcome
   because compression for direct membrane distortion reduces culture
   volume and leads to cell death due to nutrient deprivation. In this
   study, a mechanotransduction-induced lipid production (MDLP) system that
   redirects elastic microbeads to induce membrane distortion of microalgae
   with alleviating cell death was developed. This system resulted in
   accumulation of lipid in as little as 4 hr. Once compressed, porous
   microbeads absorb media and swell simultaneously while homogeneously
   inducing compression stress of microalgae. The absorbed media within
   beads could be supplied to adjacent cells and could minimize cell death
   from nutrient deficiency. All mechanotransduction was confirmed by
   measuring upregulation of calcium influx and Mat3 genes. The microbeads
   ensured robustness and controllability in repeated
   compression/de-compression processes. Overall, the MDLP system has
   potential for use as a fundamental biodiesel process that requires
   robustness and controllability.

AB Microalgal lipids have been considered as a promising source for
   biodiesel production. Alkaline pH can induce neutral lipid accumulation
   in microalgae cells. However, whether and how proton pumps, especially
   vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), function in these processes is not well
   known. In this study, we treatedPhaeodactylum tricornutumwith V-ATPase
   specific inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BFA1) to determine its role in lipid
   production. Firstly, V-ATPase activity was increased in the latter phase
   of microalgae growth. BFA1 treatment decreased the cell density and
   lipid contents. Further analysis showed that BFA1 treatment reduced the
   number and size of oil bodies. GC-MS analysis showed that lipid
   components were not affected by BFA1 treatment. Intracellular pH was
   decreased and nitrogen depletion was delayed after BFA1 treatment.
   RNA-Seq analysis showed that expression of genes involved in calcium
   signaling, sulfur metabolism, cell cycle, glycolysis, pentose phosphate
   pathway, porphyrin, chlorophyll metabolism and lipid catabolic
   metabolism were upregulated, while expression of genes involved in ion
   transmembrane transport, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, SNARE
   interactions in vesicular transport, fatty acid biosynthesis were
   downregulated under BFA1 treatment. Our findings provided insights into
   the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid accumulation and the key genes
   involved in lipid metabolism inPhaeodactylum tricornutumin response to
   BFA1.

AB Background: Microalgae are considered as a sustainable feedstock for the
   production of biofuels and other value-added compounds. In
   particular,Nannochloropsisspp. stand out from other microalgal species
   due to their capabilities to accumulate both triacylglycerol (TAG) and
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, the commercialization of
   microalgae-derived products is primarily hindered by the high production
   costs compared to less sustainable alternatives. Efficient genome
   editing techniques leading to effective metabolic engineering could
   result in strains with enhanced productivities of interesting
   metabolites and thereby reduce the production costs. Competent
   CRISPR-based genome editing techniques have been reported in several
   microalgal species, and only very recently inNannochloropsisspp. (2017).
   All the reported CRISPR-Cas-based systems inNannochloropsisspp. rely on
   plasmid-borne constitutive expression of Cas9 and a specific guide,
   combined with repair of double-stranded breaks (DSB) by non-homologous
   end joining (NHEJ) for the target gene knockout. Results: In this study,
   we report for the first time an alternative approach for
   CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome editing inNannochloropsissp.; the Cas
   ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and an editing template were directly delivered
   into microalgal cells via electroporation, making Cas expression
   dispensable and homology-directed repair (HDR) possible with high
   efficiency. Apart from widely used SpCas9, Cas12a variants from three
   different bacterium were used for this approach. We observed that
   FnCas12a fromFrancisella novicidagenerated HDR-based targeted mutants
   with highest efficiency (up to 93% mutants among transformants) while
   AsCas12a fromAcidaminococcussp. resulted in the lowest efficiency. We
   initially show that the native homologous recombination (HR) system inN.
   oceanicaIMET1 is not efficient for easy isolation of targeted mutants by
   HR. Cas9/sgRNA RNP delivery greatly enhanced HR at the target site,
   generating around 70% of positive mutant lines. Conclusion: We show that
   the delivery of Cas RNP by electroporation can be an alternative
   approach to the presently reported plasmid-based Cas9 method for
   generating mutants ofN. oceanica. The co-delivery of Cas-RNPs along with
   a dsDNA repair template efficiently enhanced HR at the target site,
   resulting in a remarkable higher percentage of positive mutant lines.
   Therefore, this approach can be used for efficient generation of
   targeted mutants inNannochloropsissp. In addition, we here report the
   activity of several Cas12a homologs inN. oceanicaIMET1, identifying
   FnCas12a as the best performer for high efficiency targeted genome
   editing.

AB A major challenge for next decades is development of competitive
   renewable energy sources, highly needed to compensate fossil fuels
   reserves and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among different
   possibilities, which are currently under investigation, there is the
   exploitation of unicellular algae for production of biofuels and
   biodiesel in particular. Some algae species have the ability of
   accumulating large amount of lipids within their cells which can be
   exploited as feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Strong research
   efforts are however still needed to fulfill this potential and optimize
   cultivation systems and biomass harvesting. Light provides the energy
   supporting algae growth and available radiation must be exploited with
   the highest possible efficiency to optimize productivity and make
   microalgae large scale cultivation energetically and economically
   sustainable. Investigation of the molecular bases influencing light use
   efficiency is thus seminal for the success of this biotechnology. In
   this work factors influencing light use efficiency in algal biomass
   production are reviewed, focusing on how algae genetic engineering and
   control of light environment within photobioreactors can improve the
   productivity of large scale cultivation systems.

AB This study focused on the feasibility of using different concentrations
   of tofu wastewater (TW) as alternative media for Tribonema minus
   cultures to produce valuable biorefinery feedstock. T. minus grew
   mixotrophically in 100% TW with larger carbohydrate (30.99% of dry
   weight (DW)), protein (15.56% of DW) and chrysolaminarin (6.93% of DW)
   accumulations than that of in mBG-11 medium. The highest biomass
   concentration, 7.77 g/L, was achieved in 100% TW, and nutrient removal
   efficiencies of T. minus at this concentration ranged from 60.49% to
   93.60%. Although smaller neutral lipid and palmitoleic acid amounts were
   detected in 100% TW, their productivities reached 133.77 and 67.19
   mg/L/d, respectively, due to the largest biomass yield contribution,
   which were comparable to those in mBG-11 medium. These findings
   demonstrated that TW is a promising alternative medium, and an
   integrated TW biotransformation and biomass valorization process is
   proposed to achieve better economic performance and environmental
   sustainability.

   the biofuels, pharmaceutical formulations, food additives, and fine
   chemicals, especially beta-carotene. We report a high-quality genome
   sequence of D. Salina FACHB435, which has a 472 Mb genome size, with a
   contig N50 of 458 Kb. A total of 30,752 protein-coding genes were
   predicted. The annotation results evaluated by BUSCO was shown that
   completeness was 91.0% and replication was 53.1%. The fragments were
   6.3% and the deletions were 2.6%. Phylogenomic and comparative genomic
   analyses revealed that A. thaliana diverged from Volvocales about 448
   million years ago, then Volvocales C. eustigma, D. salina, and other
   species diverged about 250 million years ago. High light could promote
   the accumulation of beta-carotene in D. salina at a 13 d stage of
   culture. The enrichment of DEGs in KEGG, it notes that the predicted
   up-regulated genes of carotenoid metabolic pathway include DsCrtB,
   DsPDS, DsZ-ISO, DsZDS, DsCRTISO, DsLUT5, DsCrtL-B, and DsCCD8, while the
   predicted down-regulated genes include DsCrtF, and DsLUT1. The four
   genes that were both up-regulated and down-regulated were DsZEP,
   DsCrtR-b, DsCruA/P and DsCrtZ 4. The research results can provide
   scientific basis for the industrialization practice of D. salina.

AB Improving the economic feasibility is necessary for algae-based
   processes to achieve commercial scales for biofuels and bioproducts
   production. A closed-loop system for fusel alcohol production from
   microalgae biomass with integrated nutrient recycling was developed,
   which enables the reuse of nitrogen and phosphorus for downstream
   application and thus reduces the operational requirement for external
   major nutrients. Mixed fusel alcohols, primarily isobutanol and
   isopentanol were produced from Microchloropsis salina hydrolysates by an
   engineered E. coli co-culture. During the process, cellular nitrogen
   from microalgae biomass was converted into ammonium, whereas cellular
   phosphorus was liberated by an osmotic shock treatment. The formation of
   struvite from the liberated ammonium and phosphate, and the subsequent
   utilization of struvite to support M. salina cultivation was
   demonstrated. The closed loop system established here should help
   overcome one of the identified economic barriers to scale-up of
   microalgae production, and enhance the sustainability of
   microalgae-based chemical commodities production.

AB Even with particular interest in sustainable development, due to the
   limited types of bioavailable carbon sources that could support
   heterotrophic/mixotrophic growth, microalgae-derived products still
   suffer from inconsistent yield and high costs. This study demonstrates a
   successful cocultivation of the photoautotroph Chlorella vulgaris with a
   hydrolytic-enzyme-abundant heterotroph, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera,
   enabling efficient starch upcycling from water/wastewater toward
   enhancing microalgae-dominant biomass and lipid production. The
   enzymatic activities of S. fibuligera contributed to the hydrolysis of
   starch into glucose, generating a 7-fold higher biomass through
   mixotrophic/heterotrophic growth of C. vulgaris. Further, scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and quantitative analysis
   suggested a significantly induced accumulation of lipids in C. vulgaris.
   Results of meta-transcriptomics revealed the critical regulatory role of
   illumination in interaction shifting. Gene expression for glycolysis and
   lipid biosynthesis of C. vulgaris were highly activated during dark
   periods. Meanwhile, during illumination periods, genes coding for
   glucoamylase and the sulfur-related activities in S. fibuligera were
   significantly upregulated, leading to induced starch hydrolysis and
   potential increased competition for sulfur utilization, respectively.
   This study indicates that hydrolytic organisms could collaborate to make
   starch bioavailable for nonhydrolytic microalgae, thus broadening the
   substrate spectrum and making starch a novel biotechnological feedstock
   for microalgae-derived products, e.g., biofuels or single-cell protein.

AB The gene expression at the branch point of chlorophyll and heme
   synthesis in the model microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is
   different from that of higher plants. Another green alga, Arctic
   Chlorella, was recently isolated from Arctic sea ice and may be a
   promising candidate for a biofuel. To understand the chlorophyll
   metabolic pathway and relevant nuclear gene expression in Chlorella sp.,
   we characterized chlorophyll-deficient mutants of the Arctic Chlorella
   sp. ArM0029B. First, we characterized the chlorophyll and heme
   biosynthetic pathways based on genes identified by bioinformatics
   analysis of the genome of Arctic Chlorella sp. ArM0029B. Then, we
   isolated and analyzed nine chlorophyll-deficient mutants that showed
   reduced expression of the ChlM gene, which encodes Mg-protoporphyrin
   methyltransferase. Expression of 5-amino levulinic acid dehydratase
   (encoded by ALAD) and glutamyl-tRNA reductase (encoded by HemA) was
   reduced in all nine independent mutants compared to wild type. These
   results indicated that Arctic Chlorella ArM0029B may have a regulatory
   mechanism of gene expression at earlier steps of the Mg-porphyrin branch
   that is more similar to higher plants than to the microalga C.
   reinhardtii. This study provides useful insight into the regulation of
   porphyrin precursor formation in Chlorella and related microalgae.

AB In the modern era, macro-microalgae attract a strong interest across
   scientific disciplines, owing to the wide application of these
   cost-effective valuable bioresources in food, fuel, nutraceuticals, and
   pharmaceuticals etc. The practice of eco-friendly extraction techniques
   has led scientists to create alternative processes to the conventional
   methods, to enhance the extraction of the key valuable compounds from
   macro-microalgae. This review narrates the possible use of novel cell
   disruption techniques, including use of ionic liquid, deep eutectic
   solvent, surfactant, switchable solvents, high voltage electrical
   discharge, explosive decompression, compressional-puffing, plasma, and
   ozonation, which can enable the recovery of value added substances from
   macro-microalgae, complying with the principles of green chemistry and
   sustainability. The above-mentioned innovative techniques are reviewed
   with respect to their working principles, benefits, and possible
   applications for macro-microalgae bioactive compound recovery and
   biofuel. The benefits of these techniques compared to conventional
   extraction methods include shorter extraction time, improved yield, and
   reduced cost. Furthermore, various combinations of these innovative
   technologies are used for the extraction of thermolabile bioactive
   compounds. The challenges and prospects of the innovative extraction
   processes for the forthcoming improvement of environmentally and
   cost-effective macro-microalgal biorefineries are also explained in this
   review.

   CO2efficiently and to remove nutrients of phosphorus and nitrogen,
   making it a better candidate for greenhouse gas bio-modulation and
   wastewater bioremediation. Current studies on Chlorella shows that It
   has a potential as an expression host for recombinant protein
   production, which can alter the current used one, though challenges
   remain to be addressed, performing omics analyses on
   certainChlorellastrains, which may help to uncover the biological
   implications of Chlorella and facilitate the future exploration of
   industrial application.

AB Despite receiving increasing attention during the last few decades, the
   production of microalgal biofuels is not yet sufficiently cost-effective
   to compete with that of petroleum-based conventional fuels. Among the
   steps required for the production of microalgal biofuels, the harvest of
   the microalgal biomass and the extraction of lipids from microalgae are
   two of the most expensive. In this review article, we surveyed a
   substantial amount of previous work in microalgal harvesting and lipid
   extraction to highlight recent progress in these areas. We also discuss
   new developments in the biodiesel conversion technology due to the
   importance of the connectivity of this step with the lipid extraction
   process. Furthermore, we propose possible future directions for
   technological or process improvements that will directly affect the
   final production costs of microalgal biomass-based biofuels.

AB Oil-accumulating microalgae have the potential to enable large-scale
   biodiesel production without competing for arable land or biodiverse
   natural landscapes. High lipid productivity of dominant, fast-growing
   algae is a major prerequisite for commercial production of microalgal
   oil-derived biodiesel. However, under optimal growth conditions, large
   amounts of algal biomass are produced, but with relatively low lipid
   contents, while species with high lipid contents are typically slow
   growing. Major advances in this area can be made through the induction
   of lipid biosynthesis, e.g., by environmental stresses. Lipids, in the
   form of triacylglycerides typically provide a storage function in the
   cell that enables microalgae to endure adverse environmental conditions.
   Essentially algal biomass and triacylglycerides compete for
   photosynthetic assimilate and a reprogramming of physiological pathways
   is required to stimulate lipid biosynthesis. There has been a wide range
   of studies carried out to identify and develop efficient lipid induction
   techniques in microalgae such as nutrients stress (e.g., nitrogen and/or
   phosphorus starvation), osmotic stress, radiation, pH, temperature,
   heavy metals and other chemicals. In addition, several genetic
   strategies for increased triacylglycerides production and inducibility
   are currently being developed. In this review, we discuss the potential
   of lipid induction techniques in microalgae and also their application
   at commercial scale for the production of biodiesel.

AB Background: Cyanobacteria are considered potential photosynthetic
   microbial cell factories for biofuel and biochemical production.
   Ethylene, one of the most important organic chemicals, has been
   successfully synthesized in cyanobacteria by introducing an exogenous
   ethylene-forming enzyme (Efe). However, it remains challenging to
   significantly improve the biosynthetic efficiency of cyanobacterial
   ethylene. Genetic modification of transcription factors is a powerful
   strategy for reprogramming cellular metabolism toward target products.
   In cyanobacteria, nitrogen control A (NtcA), an important global
   transcription regulator of primary carbon/nitrogen metabolism, is
   expected to play a crucial role in ethylene biosynthesis. Results: The
   partial deletion ofntcA(MH021) enhanced ethylene production by 23%,
   whilentcAoverexpression (MH023) in a
   single-copyeferecombinantSynechocystis(XX76) reduced ethylene production
   by 26%. Compared to XX76, the Efe protein content increased 1.5-fold in
   MH021. This result may be due to the release of the negative regulation
   of NtcA on promoter PcpcB, which controlsefeexpression. Glycogen content
   showed a 23% reduction in MH021, and the ratio of intracellular
   succinate to 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) increased 4.8-fold. In a
   four-copyeferecombinant strain with partially deletedntcAand a modified
   tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (MH043), a peak specific ethylene
   production rate of 2463219 L L-1 h-1 OD-1 730 was achieved, which is
   higher than previously reported. Conclusions: The effects of global
   transcription factor NtcA on ethylene synthesis in genetically
   engineeredSynechocystissp. PCC 6803 were evaluated, and the partial
   deletion ofntcAenhanced ethylene production in both singlecopy and
   multi-copyeferecombinantSynechocystisstrains. Increased Efe expression,
   accelerated TCA cycling, and redirected carbon flux from glycogen
   probably account for this improvement. The results show great potential
   for improving ethylene synthetic efficiency in cyanobacteria by
   modulating global regulation factors.

AB Background: The regulation of genes related to lipid metabolism by
   genetic engineering is an important way to increase the accumulation of
   lipids in microalgae. DNA binding with one finger (DOF) is a
   plant-specific transcription factor in higher plants, where it regulates
   carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways by regulating key genes involved
   in these pathways. Overexpression of DOF can increase lipid production
   in plants; however, it is not clear whether overexpression of DOF can
   increase lipids in microalgae. Results: In this study, we cloned a DOF
   transcription factor, crDOF, fromChlamydomonas reinhardtii. The sequence
   of this transcription factor is 1875 bp and encodes a peptide of 624
   amino acids with a conserved DOF domain. Overexpression of crDOF inC.
   reinhardtiisignificantly increased the intracellular lipid content. The
   content of total fatty acids in the transgenic algae line Tranc-crDOF-12
   was 126.01 g/mg (dry weight), which was 23.24% higher than that of the
   wild type. Additionally, the content of unsaturated fatty acids in the
   transgenic Tranc-crDOF-12 line increased significantly. Fluorescence
   quantitative PCR analysis showed that in the transgenic line
   Tranc-crDOF-12, the expression levels of BCC1, FAT1, SQD1, MGD1, DGD1
   and PGP1 genes were significantly upregulated, while the expression
   levels of ACP1, ACS1, CIS1 and SQD2 were downregulated. Conclusions: Our
   results confirm that crDOF increases intracellular lipids inC.
   reinhardtiiby regulating key genes involved in lipid metabolism.
   According to these findings, we propose that enhancing the lipid content
   in microalgae by overexpressing DOF may be achieved in other industrial
   strains of microalgae and be employed for the industrial production of
   biodiesel.

AB Euglena gracilis, a microalgal species of unicellular flagellate
   protists, has attracted much attention in both the industrial and
   academic sectors due to recent advances in the mass cultivation of E.
   gracilis that have enabled the cost-effective production of nutritional
   food and cosmetic commodities. In addition, it is known to produce
   paramylon (beta-1,3-glucan in a crystalline form) as reserve
   polysaccharide and convert it to wax ester in hypoxic and anaerobic
   conditions-a promising feedstock for biodiesel and aviation biofuel.
   However, there remain a number of technical challenges to be solved
   before it can be deployed in the competitive fuel market. Here we
   present a method for efficient selective breeding of live oil-rich E.
   gracilis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Specifically,
   the selective breeding method is a repetitive procedure for one-week
   heterotrophic cultivation, staining intracellular lipids with
   BODIPY505/515, and FACS-based isolation of top 0.5% lipid-rich E.
   gracilis cells with high viability, after inducing mutation with Fe-ion
   irradiation to the wild type (WT). Consequently, we acquire a live,
   stable, lipid-rich E. gracilis mutant strain, named B1ZFeL, with 40%
   more lipid content on average than the WT. Our method paves the way for
   rapid, cost-effective, energy-efficient production of biofuel.

AB The persistent fight against global environmental threats and energy
   catastrophe is currently a major concern for the economic development of
   bioenergy across the entire country. Hence, traditional fuel-based
   reserves are overburdened to cope with the rapid energy crisis,
   necessitating an urgent need for an innovative carbon-neutral
   green-energy resource. In order to address these critical bottlenecks,
   microalgae with incredible metabolic versatility have paved the way for
   a pivotal attention towards sustainable biofuel production. However, due
   to high operational costs and low lipid productivity, the
   microalgae-based biofuel resource is still in its infancy. As a result,
   this problem can be overcome by incorporating engineered microalgal
   strains which can pave the way for significant lipid augmentation for
   biofuel production. Thus, our current review depicts an in-depth
   understanding of a multi-omics approach to microalgae, the broad scope
   of self-sustaining microalgae cultivation, lipid-extraction strategies,
   and conversion processes to improve economic commercialization in the
   bioenergy framework. The present review also provides a detailed
   analysis of the international and national status of bioenergy
   development by several federal agencies.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of olive-oil mill wastewater (OMW) from a
   three-phase centrifugation process used in the olive-oil industry, has
   been studied in relation to the production of the microalga Scenedesmus
   obliquus CCAP 276/3A. The chemical characteristics of OMW indicated
   nitrogen deficiency. RESULTS: S. obliquus is able to assimilate
   nutrients present in a culture medium (water-OMW 5%) and grow at its
   maximum specific growth rate of 0.026 h-1, both under mixotrophic as
   well as heterotrophic conditions. The different daily doses of light
   (DDL) used, in the range 0-36 E m-2 d-1, determined light-limited and
   light-inhibited cultures. The light-inhibited mixotrophic cultures bore
   characteristics similar to those of the heterotrophic cultures, and
   became more so when the dose of light received was higher. The low
   protein yield (258 mg g-1) and high percentage of carbohydrates of the
   biomass (65.8%) confirmed a nutritional-stress situation associated with
   nitrogen limitation. CONCLUSION: The similarity between the fatty-acid
   composition of the heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultures strongly
   inhibited by light appeared to indicate the cancelling of the
   photosynthetic behaviour of the cells at high DDL values. The biomass
   generated can be used for biofuels. The maximum elimination of
   biological oxygen demand (BOD5) per unit of biomass was achieved in the
   heterotrophic cultures.

   protein such as bovine serum Albumin (BSA) was studied in various
   aqueous solutions of ionic liquids at different concentrations. In
   Chapter 4, another ionic liquid based system, an ionic liquid in water
   emulsion stabilized by microgel particles was studied for feasibility of
   separation of components in microalgal biomass. The system was evaluated
   for its efficiency to selectively separate hydrophilic components such
   as proteins from hydrophobic components such as pigments present in
   lysed microalgal biomass. The system could selectively separate the
   components and moreover the proteins so obtained retained its nativity.
   A proof of concept for continuous operation is also presented. Part 2 of
   the thesis explores the possibility of using ionic liquids for
   pre-treatment of microalgal biomass. Microalgae are known to have a
   tough cell wall and usually require energy intensive mechanical cell
   disruption to recover the intracellular components. In Chapter 5, the
   influence of aqueous solution of different ionic liquids on cell wall
   ofHaematococcus pluvialiswas studied. Aqueous solution of the ionic
   liquid, 1-ethyl, 3-methyl imidazolium dibutyl phosphate was found to
   permeabilize the cell wall ofH. pluvialisunder mild condition of
   temperature below 50°C. The pigment, astaxanthin could then be recovered
   using ethyl acetate. It is hypothesized that ionic liquid was capable of
   dissolving certain components such as mannan polymer thereby disrupting
   the polymer structure and forming tiny holes in the cell wall, thus
   paving the way for solvent to penetrate and extract astaxanthin. Using
   microscopy, it was shown that the cells remain intact after ionic liquid
   and solvent treatment and thus shows that ionic liquid permeabilizes the
   microalgae cell wall. While it was shown that tough cell wall ofH.
   pluvialiscould be permeabilized with ionic liquid under mild condition,
   other microalgae was studied, i.e.,Neochloris oleoabundansin Chapter 6.
   Different ionic liquids were tested for their ability to permeabilize
   and subsequently extract all hydrophobic components (e.g. lipids) from
   the cell without affecting the functionality of fragile molecules such
   as proteins. The results showed that microalgae could be permeabilized
   with the ionic liquid, Tributylmethylphosphonium methyl sulfate in
   addition to 1-ethyl, 3-methyl imidazolium dibutyl phosphate used forH.
   pluvialis, indicating possible difference in the cell wall composition
   of two microalgae strains. The lipids are extracted using ethyl acetate
   and the cells were further disrupted by mechanical cell disruption to
   separate the proteins and carbohydrates. The protein analysis showed
   that they were native. While these were all feasibility studies, the
   process can optimized to improve efficiency. Finally, Chapter 7
   summarizes and highlights the main findings in this thesis together with
   the implication of overall results of the thesis for future research is
   discussed.

AB Background: Sterols are vital structural and regulatory components in
   eukaryotic cells; however, their biosynthetic pathways and functional
   roles in microalgae remain poorly understood. Results: In the oleaginous
   microalgaNannochloropsis oceanica, the sterol biosynthetic pathway
   produces phytosterols as minor products and cholesterol as the major
   product. The evidence together with their deduced biosynthetic pathways
   suggests thatN. oceanicaexhibits features of both higher plants and
   mammals. Temporal tracking of sterol profiles and sterol-biosynthetic
   transcripts in response to changes in light intensity and nitrogen
   supply reveal that sterols play roles in cell proliferation, chloroplast
   differentiation, and photosynthesis. Furthermore, the dynamics of fatty
   acid (FA) and FA-biosynthetic transcripts upon chemical
   inhibitor-induced sterol depletion reveal possible co-regulation of
   sterol production and FA synthesis, in that the squalene epoxidase
   inhibitor terbinafine reduces sterol content yet significantly elevates
   free FA production. Thus, a feedback regulation of sterol and FA
   homeostasis is proposed, with the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate
   synthase (DXS, the committed enzyme in isoprenoid and sterol
   biosynthesis) gene potentially subject to feedback regulation by
   sterols. Conclusion: These findings reveal features of sterol function
   and biosynthesis in microalgae and suggest new genetic engineering or
   chemical biology approaches for enhanced oil production in microalgae.

AB Background: Marine microalgae are among the most promising lipid sources
   for biodiesel production because they can be grown on nonarable land
   without the use of potable water. Marine microalgae also harvest solar
   energy efficiently with a high growth rate, converting CO2into lipids
   stored in the cells. Both light intensity and nitrogen availability
   strongly affect the growth, lipid accumulation, and fatty acid
   composition of oleaginous microalgae. However, very few studies have
   systematically examined how to optimize lipid productivity by adjusting
   irradiance intensity, and the metabolic dynamics that may lead to
   improved lipid accumulation in microalgae have not been elucidated.
   Little is known about the mechanism of lipid synthesis regulation in
   microalgae. Moreover, few studies have assessed the potential of using
   marine microalgae as oil producers. Results: In this work, a newly
   isolated marine microalga,Chlamydomonassp. JSC4, was selected as a
   potential lipid producer, and the effect of photobioreactor operations
   on cell growth and lipid production was investigated. The combined
   effects of light intensity and nitrogen depletion stresses on growth and
   lipid accumulation were further explored in an effort to markedly
   improve lipid production and quality. The optimal lipid productivity and
   content attained were 312 mg L-1d-1and 43.1% per unit dry cell weight,
   respectively. This lipid productivity is the highest ever reported for
   marine microalgae. Metabolic intermediates were profiled over time to
   observe transient changes during lipid accumulation triggered by
   combined stresses. Finally, metabolite turnover was also assessed using
   anin vivo13C-labeling technique to directly measure the flow of carbon
   during lipid biosynthesis under stress associated with light intensity
   and nitrogen deficiency. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the
   synergistic integration of cultivation and dynamic metabolic profiling
   technologies to develop a simple and effective strategy for enhancing
   oil production in a marine microalga. The knowledge obtained from this
   study could be useful in assessing the feasibility of marine microalgae
   biodiesel production and for understanding the links between dynamic
   metabolic profiles and lipid biosynthesis during the course of
   microalgal cultivation.

AB Wastewater treatment by microalgae is the economical and environmentally
   friendly strategy, but is still challenged with the strict discharge
   standards and valuable biomass exploitations. The carbon and nitrogen
   metabolism ofChlorella pyrenoidosawas improved by the red LED light and
   starch addition to treat Tilapia aquaculture wastewater (T-AW) and
   produce protein simultaneously in a plate photobioreactor. The red LED
   light was applied to improve the nutrient removals at an outdoor
   temperature, but the concentrations except total nitrogen did not
   satisfy the discharge standards. After starch addition, the removal
   efficiencies of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chemical oxygen
   demand, and total ammonia nitrogen were 85.15, 96.96, 88.53, and 98.01%
   in a flat-plate photobioreactor, respectively, which met the discharge
   standards and the protein production reached 0.60 g/L. At a molecular
   level, the metabolic flux and transcriptome analyses showed that red
   light promoted carbon flux of the Embden-Meyerhof-Pranas pathway and
   tricarboxylic cycle, and upregulated the levels of genes encoding
   alpha-amylase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate dehydrogenase, nitrate
   transporter, and ammonium transporter, which facilitated nutrients
   removal and provided nitrogen sources for protein biosynthesis. The
   harvestingC. pyrenoidosapossessed the 62% essential amino acids and
   great lipid composition for biofuels. This study provided a new
   orientation for outdoor wastewater treatment and protein production by
   collaboratively regulating the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of
   microalgae.

AB The utilization of costly chemical fertilizers and large freshwater
   requirements make the microalgae cultivation process uneconomical and
   highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, the present study aimed
   to integrate cattle wastewater (CW) (alternate for fertilizers) with
   domestic sewage wastewater (DSW) (substitute for freshwater) to
   cultivateChlorella thermophile.To maximize the biomass yield, in-depth
   nutrient consumption patterns in both batch and fed-batch cultivation
   conditions were analyzed. Out of the eight (1%-4.5%) different CW feed
   concentrations tested during the batch cultivation, 2.5% CW set gave the
   highest biomass yield (2.17 g L-1), which was almost double the yield
   obtained using Bold Basal Medium (1.24 g L-1) and DSW without any CW
   addition (1.22 g L-1). However, the biomass yield declined with CW>
   2.5%, and the ammonium (NH4+) inhibitory effect was observed. To address
   the (NH4+) toxicity challenge and further enhance the biomass yield,
   fed-batch experiments were designed with an intermittent CW feeding
   based on nutrient (NH4+) consumption pattern. The fed-batch cultivation
   resulted in twofold increased biomass yield (4.52 g L-1) in comparison
   to the batch process. The nutrient consumption pattern inferred that the
   (NH4+) concentration greater than 600 mg L-1during the logarithmic phase
   was inhibitory forChlorella thermophilacells. On biomass
   characterization, a significant improvement in protein content with CW
   addition was observed. The FAME analysis of the derived lipid stated its
   competitive biofuel quality with up-gradation of C:16 and C:18 groups.
   Based on the obtained results, projection analysis for an integrated
   rural model demonstrated the technology's potential for sustainable
   water management with valuable resource recovery.

   extraction from the algal biomass stands as a challenge due to its low

   aiming a maximization of the lipid extraction from Scenedesmus sp.
   microalgae grown using wastewater as a nutrient medium. The extraction
   method, extraction time, solvent mixture and pretreatment were
   considered between upper and lower levels in order to access their
   significance, including their interactions, on the experimental
   response, while using a reduced number of experiments. The studies were
   performed using low-cost extraction methods (magnetic stirring and
   ultrasonication). The optimal extraction condition was obtained using
   CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) solvent mixture, in a 2-hour extraction period using
   ultrasonication. Fatty acid profiles of extracted lipids were also
   evaluated.

AB As an energy carrier, hydrogen gas is a promising substitute to
   carbonaceous fuels owing to its superb conversion efficiency,
   non-polluting nature, and high energy content. At present, hydrogen is
   predominately synthesized via chemical reformation of fossil fuels.
   While various biological methods have been extensively explored, none of
   them is justified as economically feasible. A sustainable platform for
   biological production of hydrogen will certainly impact the biofuel
   market. Among a selection of biological systems, algae and cyanobacteria
   have garnered major interests as potential cell factories for hydrogen
   production. In conjunction with photosynthesis, these organisms utilize
   inexpensive inorganic substrates and solar energy for simultaneous
   biosynthesis and hydrogen evolution. However, the hydrogen yield
   associated with these organisms remains far too low to compete with the
   existing chemical systems. This article reviews recent advances of
   biochemical, bioprocess, and genetic engineering strategies in
   circumventing technological limitations to hopefully improve the
   applicative potential of these photosynthetic hydrogen production
   systems.

AB Knowledge at the molecular level of microalgae has obtained great
   scientific interest in recent years, because of their potential for
   biofuel production, as well as other highly valued molecules. Recent
   advances in the area of the genetic manipulation of microalgae open an
   entirely new field of possible applications for these organisms as
   biorefineries. This review represents a compendium that gathers the main
   milestones that have marked the area of genetic engineering in
   microalgae during the last decade, from classical techniques for the
   transformation and expression of transgenes, to the most avant-garde
   techniques currently used for gene silencing and DNA edition, as well as
   a discussion about the future perspectives in this field.

AB The last few years has seen an ever-increasing interest in the
   exploitation of microalgae as recombinant platforms for the synthesis of
   novel bioproducts. These could be biofuel molecules, speciality enzymes,
   nutraceuticals, or therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies, hormones,
   and vaccines. This exploitation requires the development of new genetic
   engineering technologies for those fast-growing, robust species suited
   for intensive commercial cultivation in bioreactor systems. In
   particular, there is a need for routine methods for the genetic
   manipulation of the chloroplast genome, for two reasons: firstly, the
   chloroplast genetic system is well-suited to the targeted insertion into
   the genome and high-level expression of foreign genes; secondly, the
   organelle is the site of numerous biosynthetic pathways and therefore
   represents the obvious "chassis," on which to bolt new metabolic
   pathways that divert the carbon fixed by photosynthesis into novel
   hydrocarbons, pigments, etc. Stable transformation of the algal
   chloroplast was first demonstrated in 1988, using the model chlorophyte,
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Since that time, tremendous advances have
   been made in the development of sophisticated tools for engineering this
   particular species, and efforts to transfer this technology to other
   commercially attractive species are starting to bear fruit. In this
   article, we review the current field of algal chloroplast transgenics
   and consider the prospects for the future.

AB This paper presents a model-based assessment of the thermochemical
   conversion of microalgal biomass into Fischer-Tropsch liquids, hydrogen
   and electricity through polygeneration. Two novel conceptual plants are
   investigated, which are both comprised of the same operation units
   (gasification, water-gas shift, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, upgrading,
   separation, Rankine cycle and gas turbines) and mainly differ in the
   location of the water-gas-shift unit. Both plants are found to present a
   carbon efficiency greater than conventional biomass-to-liquid processes.
   The most profitable plants in terms of the saleable products yields ca.
   0.23 m3(1.4 bbl) of liquid transportation fuels (gasoline, kerosene and
   diesel), ca. 16 kg of hydrogen (716.8 scm), and ca. 1.55*109J (430 kW.h)
   of electricity per 1000 kg of dried microalgae. The corresponding
   displaced fossil fuels could offset the carbon emissions by 0.56 kg of
   carbon dioxide for every kg of processed dried microalgae. Nevertheless,
   predicted break-even prices are lower than 40 USD per ton of dried
   microalgae in the base case scenario, which is at least 10 times cheaper
   than the current best scenario for microalgal biomass production. These
   low prices are a major impediment to the viability of these
   thermochemical polygeneration plants, albeit presenting a good potential
   toward cleaner liquid fuel production.

AB A substantial interest is growing in the cultivation of microalgae as a
   source of biofuel production, considering their relatively high lipid
   content, fast growth rates, use of alternative water sources, and growth
   on non-arable land. This paper conducts an energy life cycle analysis
   for a novel hypothetical hybrid energy system where the electricity
   required for microalgae cultivation is generated from semi-transparent
   PV panels to energise paddle wheels and light emitting diodes installed
   on raceway ponds. The combined system configuration allows for a full
   utilisation of the solar spectrum, while enhancing the photosynthetic
   productivity of microalgae cultivation and reducing the evaporation from
   raceway ponds. The findings of study for a hypothetical system installed
   in Western Australia show that the amount of land use substantially
   decreases by 43%, the productivity of microalgae cultivation increases
   by 75%, while the net energy return of the system remains significantly
   higher than one, in comparison with a microalgae cultivation system
   energised by grid electricity. Among a range of variables affecting the
   energy performance of the proposed system, the primary energy demand for
   PV panels and conversion efficiency of LEDs exert the highest impact on
   energy life cycle of the system.

SO Science of the Total Environment

U1 1
U2 33
AB Against the worldwide energy crisis and climate change, new forms of
   energy generation have been investigated. Among the possibilities,
   microalgae are considered potential feedstock for biofuels production.
   However, there are still important challenges to overcome. In this
   context, the integration of biomass cultivation and the treatment of
   different types of wastewater can represent a source of nutrients and
   water, with the additional benefit of reducing the discharge of
   pollutant loads into water bodies. The wastewater grown biomass is
   composed by a microorganism consortium. These microorganisms can develop
   important symbiotic relationships for the optimization of biomass
   production. However, the success of algal biomass cultivation in
   effluents also involves the development of efficient reactors, which
   ranges from design criteria to operational parameters. High rate ponds
   are the most suitable reactors for such a purpose, within the context of
   a wastewater treatment plant. In this reactor, the addition of CO2is an
   important parameter for pH control and, consequently, will influence
   nutrient assimilation. Another relevant operational parameter is the
   pond depth, which will have a major role in radiation availability along
   the water column. With respect to the energy use of the biomass,
   hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) represents an interesting alternative
   for wastewater grown biomass, since the process does not require
   complete drying of the biomass, its bio-oil production efficiency is not
   necessarily attached to the lipid content and may present a positive
   energy balance. In addition, the possibility of using the HTL
   by-products, especially the water soluble products, in the context of a
   biorefinery, represents a route for nutrient recycling, residue
   minimization, and cost reduction.

AB The exploitation of new economically valuable microalgae as a

   the full utilization of microalgae. The efficient preparation of minor
   products from microalgae remains the challenge, owing to the coexistence
   of various components with a similar polarity in the microalgae biomass.
   In this study, a novel approach based on the sustainable-oriented
   strategy for fucoxanthin (FX) production was proposed, which consisted
   of four steps, including the culture of microalga, ethanol extraction,
   ODS column chromatography, and ethanol precipitation. The high-purity FX
   (around 95%) was efficiently obtained in a total recovery efficiency of
   84.28  2.56%. This study reveals that I. zhangjiangensis is a
   potentially promising feedstock for FX production and firstly provides a
   potentially eco-friendly method for the scale-up preparation of FX from
   the microalga I. zhangjiangensis.

AB In this paper the hypothesis was tested whether TAG accumulation serves
   as an energy sink when microalgae are exposed to an energy imbalance
   caused by nutrient limitation. In our continuous culture system, excess
   light absorption and growth-limiting nitrogen supply rates were
   combined, which resulted in accumulation of TAG (from 1.5% to 12.4% w/w)
   in visible lipid bodies inNeochloris oleoabundans, while cell
   replication was sustained. A fourfold increase in TAG productivity
   showed that TAG indeed served as an energy sink. However, the bulk of
   excess energy was dissipated leading to a significantly reduced biomass
   productivity and yield of biomass on light. This demonstrates that when
   aiming at industrial TAG production, sustaining efficient light energy
   use under nutrient stress is an important trait to look for in potential
   production organisms.

AB Microalgae have been studied and tested for over 70 years. However,
   biodiesel, the prime target of the algal industry, has suffered from low
   competitiveness and current steps toward banning the internal combustion
   engine all over the world. Meanwhile, interest in reducing CO2 emissions
   has grown as the world has witnessed disasters caused by global warming.
   In this situation, in order to maximize the benefits of the microalgal
   industry and surmount current limitations, new breakthroughs are being
   sought. First, drop-in fuel, mandatory for the aviation and maritime
   industries, has been discussed as a new product. Second, methods to
   secure stable and feasible outdoor cultivation focusing on CO2
   sequestration were investigated. Lastly, the need for an integrated
   refinery process to simultaneously produce multiple products has been
   discussed. While the merits of microalgae industry remain valid, further
   investigations into these new frontiers would put algal industry at the
   core of future bio-based economy.

AB Microalgae have recently emerged as the most favorite feedstock for
   triacylglycerol (TAG), the storage neutral lipid, for renewable and
   sustainable production of biodiesel, mainly due to their comparable
   lipid contents, faster growth rates and lesser land requirements as
   compared to the non-conventional and non-edible oilseed crops. But the
   real technological challenge is to mass produce microalgae with much
   higher lipid content to make the production of a low-value-high-volume
   product like biodiesel economically viable and environmentally
   sustainable. Recent scientific achievements in TAG overproduction in
   higher eukaryotic systems may be leveraged upon to enhance lipid
   synthesis by manifold in microalgae. Since the available sequence
   homology information have been effectively used in case of the model
   unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to perform
   genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, the gained knowledge and the
   well established genetic engineering tools and techniques coupled with
   the modern system biology approaches may well pave the way for
   delineating and deciphering the TAG biosynthetic pathways in lipid
   accumulating microalgae as targets for metabolic pathway engineering.
   This review thus analyzes the trends and developments in the area of
   metabolic engineering of lipid synthesis in microalgae and discusses the
   vision based on some of the possible strategies that could be adopted to
   reconstruct a stable modified engineered microalga with enhanced lipid
   producing capabilities. The strategies include flux balance analysis for
   target gene identification, over expression of the target enzymes
   involved in lipid biosynthesis, over expression of the target gene under
   specific inducible promoters, constitutive expression of transcription
   regulators, diverting the flux of key metabolites, and integrated in
   silico based approaches. An integrated approach involving multiple gene
   targeting by applying the principles and knowledge of systems biology
   and bioinformatics would provide us with a holistic view and help derive
   some feasible solutions.

AB Growing energy demand and exhaustion of mainstream fuels lead to the
   need for renewable energy sources. Microalgae possess remarkable
   properties including carbon dioxide mitigation, accruing intracellular
   lipids and an ability to thrive in harsh conditions, which makes them a
   potential feedstock for biofuel production. However, narrow
   photosynthetic light absorption and limited lipid production are major
   bottlenecks that remain key obstacles to practical commercialization.
   Therefore, previous research has suggested that the use of nanomaterials
   could overcome these restrictions. Their extraordinary physicochemical
   characteristics, as well as an enormous surface area, can be exploited
   in practical applications. Some nanomaterials are reported to promote
   the photosynthetic efficiency of microalgal cells, which in turn
   increases biomass production. Furthermore, by using specific
   nanoparticles, an advancement in lipid production can also be achieved.
   A specific group of nanomaterials target the upregulation of the key
   enzymes involved in the lipid synthesis pathway, which in turn leads to
   higher lipid production and accumulation. However, most of the studies
   deciphered their toxic behaviour. This review endeavours to deliver an
   overarching insight into the impact of nanomaterials on microalgae
   photosynthesis, lipid and biodiesel production. It also focuses on the
   use of algal residue in possible applications that makes the process
   largely sustainable with zero waste. This review surveys the state of
   the combination of nanotechnology and microalgae to achieve high biomass
   and lipid production along with other valuable products.

AB Background: Microalgae are considered promising alternative energy
   sources because they consume CO2and accumulate large amounts of lipids
   that can be used as biofuel.Nannochloropsisis a particularly promising
   microalga due to its high growth rate and lipid content, and the
   availability of genomic information. Transcription factors (TFs) are
   global regulators of biological pathways by up- or down-regulation of
   related genes. Among these, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs regulate
   growth, development, and stress responses in plants and animals, and
   have been identified in microalgae. We identified two bHLH TFs in the
   genome ofN. salinaCCMP1776,NsbHLH1, andNsbHLH2, and characterized
   functions ofNsbHLH2that may be involved in growth and nutrient uptake.
   Results: We obtainedNsbHLH2overexpressing transformants ofN.
   salinaCCMP1776 by particle bombardment and confirmed that these were
   stable transformants. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
   (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting using antibodies against the FLAG tag
   that was attached at the end of the coding sequence confirmed the
   expression of the NsbHLH2 protein under various culture conditions. The
   qRT-PCR results also indicated that the endogenous and transgenic
   expression ofNsbHLH2was reduced under stressed conditions.
   Overexpression ofNsbHLH2led to increased growth rate in the early growth
   period, and concomitantly higher nutrient uptake, than wild type (WT).
   These enhanced growth and nutrient uptake resulted in increased
   productivities of biomass and FAME. For example, one of the
   transformants, NsbHLH2 3-6, showed increased biomass productivity by 36%
   under the normal condition, and FAME productivity by 33% under nitrogen
   limitation condition. Conclusively, the improved growth in the
   transformants can be associated with the enhanced nutrient uptake. We
   are currently assessing their potential for scale-up cultivation with
   positive outcomes. Conclusion: Overexpression ofNsbHLH2led to enhanced
   growth rate and nutrient uptake during the early growth phase, and
   increased biomass and FAME productivity, especially in the later period
   under normal and stressed conditions. Based on these results, we
   postulate thatNsbHLH2can be employed for the industrial production of
   biodiesel fromN. salina.

AB Fossil fuels that mainly supply the current increasing world's energy
   demand originated from non-renewable resources. In addition to the
   depletion of their resources within the next short time, the combustion
   of fossil fuels to power industries and transportation also negatively
   impacts humans and the environment due to the release of various gaseous
   pollutants. To increase the share of renewables in the primary energy
   mix, the Government of Indonesia is currently struggling to meet a
   target of 23% by 2025. Therefore, more significant efforts to search for
   potential renewable energy sources are the only way to overcome this
   issue. Bioethanol is an eco-friendly renewable energy source since its
   combustion emits a low concentration of pollutants. Microalgae have
   gained significant interest in bioethanol production because of rapid
   biomass growth and relatively easy pre-treatment steps. It is renewable,
   carbon-neutral, sustainable and can be grown in wastewater coupling as
   wastewater treatment. This paper reviews bioethanol production,
   providing knowledge on the characteristics of microalgae potential for
   producing biomass to be converted into bioethanol, introducing process
   for bioethanol production, and presenting the potential challenges of
   bioethanol as a future renewable energy.

AB Microalgae are considered as attractive feedstocks for biofuel
   production nowadays because of their high lipid contents and easy
   cultivation. In the present study, two diatoms, Thalassiosira
   weissflogii and Chaetoceros muelleri, were cultured under various
   nutrient-limitation conditions to explore their comprehensive lipid
   accumulation profiles for further commercialization. In T. weissflogii,
   the highest neutral lipid accumulation and highest lipid productivity
   (14.28 mg L-1 day-1) were both recorded under P-limitation. In C.
   muelleri, the highest lipid content (35.03% of dry cell weight), highest
   neutral lipid accumulation, and highest lipid productivity (29.07 mg L-1
   day-1) were all recorded under N-limitation. Besides, the predominant
   fatty acids of T. weissflogii and C. muelleri were myristic acid
   (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), and palmitoleic acid (C16:1), with the
   amounts of 58.4-74.4 and 74.1-87.7% of the total fatty acids,
   respectively. Moreover, nutrient limitations led to a lower proportion
   of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than that of saturated fatty acid
   (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) in both species. The ratios
   of (SFA+MUFA) to PUFA were from 1.65 to 3.01 in T. weissflogii, and up
   to 3.61 to 8.59 in C. muelleri. Our results suggested the feasibility of
   C. muelleri as biodiesel feedstock due to its more suitable fatty acid
   composition and higher lipid productivity compared to T. weissflogii.

AB Exploring the efficiency of algae to produce remarkable products can be
   directly benefitted by studying its mechanism at systems level. Recent
   advents in biotechnology like flux balance analysis (FBA), genomics and
   in silico proteomics minimize the wet lab exertion. It is understood
   that FBA predicts the metabolic products, metabolic pathways and
   alternative pathway to maximize the desired product, and these are key
   components for microalgae bio-engineering. This review encompasses
   recent transgenesis techniques and metabolic engineering strategies
   applied to different microalgae for improving different traits. Further
   it also throws light on RNAi and riboswitch engineering based methods
   which may be advantageous for high throughput microalgal research. A
   valid and optimally designed microalga can be developed where every
   engineering strategies meet each other successfully and will definitely
   fulfill the market needs. It is also to be noted that Omics (viz.
   genetic and metabolic manipulation with bioinformatics) should be
   integrated to develop a strain which could prove to be a futuristic
   solution for sustainable development for energy.

AB Algae is generally regarded as the only source of renewable biodiesel
   that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels.
   Hydrothermal liquefaction is the method of dissolving organic compounds
   in subcritical water at high ion product, which can accelerate the
   acid-catalyzed and hydrolytic decomposition of algal macromolecules.
   This promising process converts different algal strains with high
   moisture content to high bio-oil yields with lower coke and lower energy
   consumption in comparison to other methods. The properties of the
   resulting bio-oil are clearly affected by parameters such as
   temperature, reaction time, algae species, algae concentration, reaction
   atmosphere, and catalysts, in subcritical water reaction conditions.
   This paper will provide an extensive review of the updated results on
   the hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae. Including summary on the
   conversion of major compounds in microalgae and products related to the
   process and the influences of reaction conditions, catalysts and
   hydrotreating with comparing the variation tendencies and main results
   reported.

VL 248

U1 33
U2 192
AB The utilization of seawater supplemented with wastewater nutrients for
   microalgae cultivation represents a promising and cost-effective
   approach that combines the benefits of wastewater treatment and
   microalgal resource recovery. However, the high salt content in seawater
   poses a significant challenge, hindering microalgal growth and reducing
   the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus on a large scale. The
   phytohormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) was used in this study to enhance
   stress resistance and lipid production of Chlorella pyrenoidosa grown in
   seawater-wastewater medium. Compared to the control groups involving
   regular wastewater and seawater-containing wastewater without IAA,
   Chlorella pyrenoidosa cultivated in the seawater-containing wastewater
   supplemented with IAA exhibited remarkable outcomes. Specifically,
   microalgae in IAA-enhanced seawater-containing wastewater achieved the
   highest lipid productivity (22.67 mg L-1 d-1) along with impressive
   nitrogen (99.3%) and phosphorus (97.3%) removal rates. Moreover, their
   cell sedimentation ratio reached 76.6%, indicating enhanced settling
   properties. Additionally, the physiological mechanism changes after
   exposure to seawater stress and IAA were revealed based on the changes
   in antioxidant enzymes, endogenous hormones, and fatty acid saturation.
   Furthermore, the transcriptomic analysis elucidated the molecular
   mechanisms underlying microalgal lipid synthesis and their response to
   antioxidant stress when exposed to seawater. The supplementation of IAA
   under seawater stress stimulated energy metabolism and the antioxidant
   response in microalgal cells, effectively mitigating the adverse effects
   of seawater stress and promoting overall algal lipid productivity.
   Overall, this study unveiled the potential of exogenous plant hormones,
   particularly IAA, in enhancing stress resistance and lipid productivity
   of microalgae grown in seawater-wastewater medium, which significantly
   contributed towards the efficient use of seawater resources for
   microalgae cultivation and biofuel production.

AB Microalgae are mostly photoautotrophic microscopic organisms. According
   to their cellular structure, they are classified into two types,
   eukaryotes, and prokaryotes, and they are distributed in all types of
   ecosystems, presenting unique qualities due to the fact that they
   synthesize high value-added molecules used in various productive and
   environmental activities, and because their biomass is used as raw
   material to obtain various products. Therefore, the objective of this
   review was to collect, organize, and collate current information on the
   use of microalgae in the development of biotechnology involving the
   areas of agriculture, health, food, bioremediation, and biofuels. The
   results show that the microalga Chlorella stands out for its multiple
   uses in the five areas considered in this study. The search for
   healthier and more environmentally friendly technologies has contributed
   to the development of new biotechnological applications that require the
   study and incorporation of specialized microorganisms to replace and/or
   improve existing applications.

AB In comparison to other methods of producing hydrogen, the production of
   biohydrogen is significantly less harmful to the surrounding ecosystem
   when it was produced from the biological origin such as microalgae. It
   could take the place of conventional fossil fuels while avoiding the
   emission of greenhouse gases. The substrates such as food, agricultural

   the final results, making this method a potentially useful instrument.
   As a consequence of this, numerous approaches to pretreat the algal
   biomass, numerous types of enzymes and catalyst that play a crucial role
   for hydrogen production, the variables that influence the production of

AB Though microalgae and macroalgae are considered as a potential feedstock
   for biofuel and industrially important co-products extraction, still
   there are several research barriers on the commercialization of
   algae-based fuels and products. Based on these bottlenecks, this review
   underpins the biochemical composition of micro- and macroalgae regarding
   biofuel production and bioactive compounds extraction. Further, the
   second chapter summarizes the various cultivation systems for rapid
   generation of macroalgal biomass. Micro- and macroalgae are untapped for
   bioenergy production to assess the feasibility of future green fuel
   sustainability. In general, algae were considered as a potential source
   for various applications worldwide owing to their rich and enormous
   bioactive potential. Therefore, a separate section devoted to recognize
   the crucial role and biological activities of primary and secondary
   metabolites in micro- and macroalgal species, their significant
   contribution as functional foods or therapeutic agents in nutraceutical
   and pharmaceutical industries. The extensive discussion on the
   phenolics, flavonoids and pharmacological properties of other bioactive
   compounds extracted from microalgae has been provided. Further,
   carbohydrates, proteins (phycobiliproteins and phycoerythrin) and their
   organic extraction from macroalgal strains (seaweeds) were well
   described. This review paper describes the importance of bioactive
   compounds and their value in the various other markets besides biofuel

AB Biodiesel, the name popularly given to fatty acid alkyl esters, has
   become an attractive option for the replacement of petroleum diesel
   ('petrodiesel'). While its overall impact on the greenhouse effect
   continues to be debated, other qualities of biodiesel are unquestioned.
   Biodiesel is biodegradable, generally non-toxic and has superior
   lubricity to petrodiesel. Overall emissions are greatly reduced. The
   bulk of the feedstock for its production comes from renewable resources
   and when biodiesel is used as a blend (up to 20%); no changes are
   required for existing diesel engines. However, it is still too costly
   and about 60-80% of the cost for biodiesel comes from the feedstock.
   Concerns have been raised about the propriety of using food for fuel.
   Proposed alternative feedstock such asJatropha curcasaddress some of
   these concerns but have their own disadvantages. This paper is a
   comprehensive review of recent progress on alternative crops for
   feedstock and addresses the issues that may ultimately lead to their
   success or failure: engine performance, yield, fatty acid profile,
   unique minor components, unique fatty acids, toxicity and
   harvestability. The use of agricultural wastes, used or waste oil and
   microbial fats is also discussed. The conclusion is reached that a blend
   of oils and used oils may be the best approach for the immediate future
   while genetically modified plants and microalgae may provide a longer
   term solution.

AB When employing biotechnological processes for the procurement of
   biofuels and bio-products from microalgae, one of the most critical
   steps affecting economy and yields is the "cell disruption" stage.
   Currently, enzymatic cell disruption has delivered effective and cost
   competitive results when compared to mechanical and chemical cell
   disruption methods. However, the introduction of enzymes implies
   additional associated cost within the overall process. In order to
   reduce this cost, autolysis of microalgae is proposed as alternative
   enzymatic cell disruption method. This review aims to provide the state
   of the art of enzymatic cell disruption treatments employed in
   biorefinery processes and highlights the use of endopeptidases. During
   the enzymatic processes of microalgae life cycle, some lytic enzymes
   involved in cell division and programmed cell death have been proven
   useful in performing cell lysis. In this context, the role of
   endopeptidases is emphasized. Mirroring these natural events, an
   alternative cell disruption approach is proposed and described with the
   potential to induce the autolysis process using intrinsic cell enzymes.
   Integrating induced autolysis within biofuel production processes offers
   a promising approach to reduce overall global costs and energetic input
   associated with those of current cell disruption methods. A number of
   options for further inquiry are also discussed.

AB Aims: The United States Department of Energy is aiming to bring
   microalgal biofuels into commercial use by 2030 at the price of $3 per
   gasoline gallon equivalent. Large-scale production of biofuel faces many
   challenges including naturally occurring algal phages; and
   characterizing this threat is the aim of this study. Methods and
   Results: Bench-scale experiments were performed to study the impact of
   viral infectivity on the production of microalgal in bioreactors. All
   environmental samples were tested positive for algal phages which showed
   various levels of infectivity against Synechocystis PCC 6803 and the
   environmental isolates of microalgae. The viral attachment to algal
   cells was observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and to
   determine the shape and size of the viral particles. All the viruses
   detected were c. 50-60 nm icosahedral particles. Viral infection
   resulted in 48% reduction in the biomass of the infected algal culture
   in 22 days. Conclusions: This study has lead to the conclusion that the
   microalgal phages prevalent in natural environment may cause infections
   in broad range of microalgae used for biofuel production. Significance
   and Impact of the Study: This study has detected and quantified the
   phages that can infect algal populations in natural freshwater habitats
   and laboratory cultures of microalgal strains. The impact of viral
   threat to health of commercial algal production operations has been
   identified in this study.

AB Hydrogen is a non-polluting source of energy, which is renewable and
   very abundant in the universe. Microalgae and cyanobacteria produce
   hydrogen by breaking down water and organic compounds. The aim of this
   research was to develop hydrogen production using
   cyanobacteriumAnabaenasp. by nitrogen deprivation in two experimental
   phases of cultivation, optimizing its biomass from physicochemical
   variables. The experiment was carried out with axenic culture, in BG-11
   medium, in triplicate, in two steps and under continuous illumination:
   in the first step, cultures were maintained in an aerobic condition
   until the first half of growth phase under nitrogen limitation; in the
   second step, the biomass was transferred, by centrifugation and cell
   wash, to anaerobic photobioreactors under nitrogen deprivation and the
   atmosphere was changed by argon for hydrogen production. Hydrogen was
   detected by gas chromatography and the hydrogen production parameters
   were tested using the Gompertz model and the volume by the general ideal
   gas equation. The optimization of biomass in the first step of
   cultivation increased its yield by 18.3% and heterocysts formation was
   3.4 times higher in nitrogen privation conditions. Therefore, hydrogen
   production by cell increased 55.2% and the productivity 57.6% when
   compared to the culture ofAnabaenasp. in control condition. The method
   and the strain were effective for hydrogen production and the pH,
   temperature and light intensity affected the improvement of this
   production and increased the biomass yield.

AB Microalgae based biofuel has been extensively researched with huge
   investment over more than a past decade. However, integration of lipid
   accumulation and recovery needs to be optimized for economical
   production of biofuel. Microalgae are promising feedstocks for
   carbon-neutral biofuels and their commercialization depends on strain
   improvement by targeted inhibition of desired gene to increase lipid
   content. The current review describes the triacylglycerol, phospholipid,
   fatty acid, starch biosynthetic pathway and target gene for metabolic
   engineering. Further, it focuses on genome editing techniques viz.,
   Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, RNA
   Interference, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases, Mutation
   and chemical inhibitor to enhance triacylglycerol content together with
   cultivation and biomass harvesting for fuel precursor extraction. It
   also highlights the latest development, challenges for integrating
   single cell oil accumulation and extraction methods like, biomass
   pretreatment, solvent based cell lysis and solvent free green
   technologies for fuel conversion. Future efforts on microalgal
   extracellular matrix, organelle membrane biology, continuous production
   of oil and non-destructive oil recovery from growth media need to be
   addressed for large scale commercial production of biofuel.

AB Availability of renewable biomass for the production of bioenergy is
   need of hour as fossil-based energy consumption has led to both
   environmental and health problems. Algae biomass gains advantages over
   other biomasses (agriculture, sewage, forest, sludge, municipal waste)
   due to their availability, biomass generation in wastewater and negative
   carbon dioxide emission. In this review paper, we have explored the
   algae biomass cultivation routes, thermochemical conversion and
   upgradation of algal biomass. Photo bioreactors (tubular, bag, flat
   panel, etc) are preferred for microalgae cultivation in association with
   raceway open ponds for liquid hydrocarbons production. Algae biomass are
   processed through hydrothermal liquefaction (Temperature range of
   220-320°C, time of 60 min, pressure of 5-20 bar), pyrolysis (Temperature
   range of 320-420°C) and co-liquefaction. The commonly upgradation
   techniques are catalytic cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, etc.
   Hydrodeoxygenation was performed to nullify the oxygen content of
   bio-oil, since in adverse case the bio-oil with higher content causes
   corrosion and coke formation in combustion engines. The algae biofuel
   production cost depends upon the conversion techniques and upgrading
   processes. Further in future this review provides strong base for
   exploring the aqueous phase obtained from thermochemical process for
   bio-hydrogen production via photo-catalytic reforming processes.

AB Objective: With the increasing depletion of fossil energy, biomass
   energy as an alternative energy source has become more concerned.
   Biodiesel is considered to be one of the best alternative energy sources
   to solve the problem of limited fossil fuel reserves due to its
   extremely high similarity to fossil diesel in terms of energy density
   and combustion performance. Currently, most biodiesel is produced
   worldwide from oil crops or animal oil materials. When the edible oil
   crops were used as raw materials for the production of biodiesel,it
   would compete with the food market, and then lead to food shortages.
   Microalgae can grow 10-50 folds faster than terrestrial plants.
   Nutritional composition such as lipids, carbohydrates and proteins of
   microalgae is 3 folds more than those derived from plants and fish. They
   can be cultivated on non-arable land without seasonal limitation.At the
   same time, the harvesting could be in a daily basis. Therefore,
   microalgae have been widely regarded as one of the most promising raw
   materials for biofuels. Nevertheless, one of the main factors hindering
   the industrialization of microalgae biodiesel is its low production of
   microalgae lipid.In this study,to enhance the lipid production, the
   total lipid production of the microalgae strain Z8was used as the
   evaluation index, microalgae heterotrophic medium conditions were
   further optimized. Specifically, the most significant process parameters
   such as glucose, magnesium sulfate, sodium nitrate, calcium chloride,
   dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and citric acid were selected for the
   optimization through using the method of one-variable-at-a time and
   response surface methodology.[Method]The effects of different ingredient
   concentrations in the medium, such as glucose, magnesium sulfate, citric
   acid, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium nitrate, and calcium
   chloride,on the biomass and lipid production were investigated by using
   the method of single factor experiment. After completing the above
   steps, the main influencing factors were found by the
   Plackett-Burman(P-B)screening test. Then, the selected significant
   influencing factors were further optimized through the Central Composite
   Design(CCD)test, and then the optimal culture conditions for microalgae
   were established. Result: Based on the results of single factor
   experiment, the biomass and total lipid were firstly enhanced and then
   remained unchanged when the concentration of glucose was improved. With
   the increase of the concentration of magnesium sulfate, sodium nitrate,
   dipotassium phosphate and citric acid, the phenomenon that the biomass
   and total lipid both increased firstly and then decreased was observed.
   However, there was no significant change in biomass and total lipid if
   the calcium chloride concentration was improved. Four significant
   factors, such as glucose, magnesium sulfate, citric acid, and
   dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, were obtained through the P-B screening
   test.At the same time, these four significant influencing factors were
   further analyzed through the Central Composite Design test, and the
   optimal culture conditions were as follows:magnesium sulfate 200 mg/L,
   dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 0.07 g/L, glucose 18 g/L, citric acid 9
   mg/L, sodium nitrate 1.5 g/L and calcium chloride 0.04 g/L. Other
   conditions were consistent with the heterotrophic BG-11 medium. Under
   these conditions, the biomass of 7.7 g/L and the lipid production of
   3.17 g/L were obtained,respectively, which were 40.77% and 128% higher
   than those under unoptimized conditions. Conclusion: The biomass and
   total lipid of the microalgae strain Z8are outstandingly improved by the
   method of response surface methodology. These results indicate that the
   step-by-step optimization approach could provide some scientific
   suggestions for enhancing the lipid production of microalgae or
   improving other similar fermentation processes, which is beneficial to
   microalgae biodiesel industrialization and commercialization.

AB The unicellular algaNannochloropsissp. (Eustigmatophyta) is a rich
   source of lipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as eicosapentaenoic
   acid) and carotenoids (violaxanthin), which makes it valuable for human
   consumption, aquaculture and biofuel production. Mass production
   ofNannochloropsissp. can be easily achieved in high-rate algal ponds
   (HRAP), in flat panel photobioreactors (FPP) or in tubular
   photobioreactors. While easy to operate, these systems are prone to
   unfavorable growth conditions, which affect productivity. In the present
   study, we cultivatedNannochloropsissp. in 2 outdoor production systems
   and monitored photosynthetic activity. Unfavorable conditions
   (stressors), such as high temperature and high pH in combination with
   high irradiance, were induced in FPP, causing a substantial reduction in
   the photosynthetic rate. The measurements ofNannochloropsissp.
   photosynthetic activity using several chlorophyll fluorescence
   techniques as well as oxygen production measurements showed that this
   species is able to withstand high irradiance levels. Although some
   photodamage due to high irradiance was found, the cultures rapidly
   recovered.Nannochloropsissp. coped well with high pH conditions under
   physiological temperatures. However, a temperature rise above 32°C was
   detrimental, with repair processes being unable to keep up with the rate
   of damage. The cultures in the FPP were more prone to damage by extreme
   temperatures than those in the HRAP due to the high surface:volume
   ratio, which complicated temperature regulation within the physiological
   range.

   release free fatty acids (FFAs), a biofuel precursor. The system uses
   thermostable lipases encoded by genes from thermophilic organisms that
   have been transferred into the cyanobacterial genome and can be
   synthesized by turning off CO2 availability and subsequently activated
   by increasing the concentrated culture temperature. When synthesized in
   FFA-producing strains, the lipase Fnl from Fervidobacterium nodosum
   Rt17-B1 released the most FFA. Of the seven candidate lipases
   investigated, Fnl-synthesizing strains yielded 42.71.5 mg/l FFA at 47°C.
   We also determined that the optimal production conditions for SD338, the
   Synechocystis strain synthesizing Fnl, was to keep the cell concentrates
   at 46°C for two days after a one-day CO2 limitation pretreatment of the
   culture. A 4-l continuous semi-batch production experiment with SD338
   showed that daily harvested cultures (1 l) released an average of
   43.96.6 mg fatty acid and this productivity lasted for at least 20 days
   without significant decline. This improved thermorecovery process can be
   used in conjunction with other means to genetically engineer
   cyanobacteria to produce biofuels or biofuel precursors as the final
   step in recovery of membrane lipids.

AB The use of microalgae in biotechnological processes, such as bioenergy
   production and wastewater treatment have been and continue to be of
   great interest. However, the commercialization of their potential is
   hindered due to various technical challenges, with biomass harvesting
   being the largest and most expensive energy consumer among them.
   Therefore, a major challenge is in finding an efficient harvesting
   method with high economic feasibility. In this study, a
   rapid-sedimentation freshwater green microalga was used for batch
   treatment of artificial wastewater. This strain, in addition to its
   ability to efficiently remove and use N, P as a source of nutrients, has
   the advantage of a fast-sedimentation innate feature that allows for a
   rapid biomass settling (less than 10 minutes) without the addition of
   any flocculant. This green microalgal strain grows in the form of
   macrocolonies that significantly favor harvesting by rapid natural
   gravitational sedimentation. Thus, as this microalga will not require
   centrifugal harvesting, which is expensive and energy-consuming, its use
   at both bench and pilot scale could be a promising, cost-effective, and
   environmentally friendly approach for biotechnological applications.

U1 4
U2 41
AB Demand for clean energy has increased due to the proliferation of
   climate change impact from excessive emission of greenhouse gases (GHG)
   from the combustion of fossil fuels. H2is a clean energy source since
   water vapor is the only byproduct after its combustion. Growing
   microalgae offers a promising low-energy and low-cost approach for
   bioH2production. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was performed
   for the production of H2using microalgae to evaluate the conceptual,
   intellectual, and social structure of the dataset. In addition, a
   scoping review of articles was conducted to highlight recent
   advancements and identify future research recommendations. A total of
   184 relevant publications over 23 years (2000-2022) were retrieved from
   the Scopus database for analysis. The results demonstrated an
   exponential increase in citations from 283 to 996 in the last decade,
   indicating the interest in bioH2production from microalgae. Results also
   revealed that the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy accounted for
   more than 25% of the published articles, of which China contributed
   almost 28%. Oxygen sensitivity of the H2ase enzyme and sulfur
   deprivation were highlighted as the main limiting factors of
   bioH2production using microalgae. It was also evident that the most
   widely studied microalgae species were green algae,
   especiallyChlamydomonasandChlorella.Effective process modifications,
   particularly hybridizing microalgae with bacteria consortium and
   implementing oxygen regulating strategies, were shown to give up to a
   10-fold increase in H2yield. This study also discusses recent
   developments in technologies, strategies, microalgal species, and
   optimizing controlling factors affecting bioH2production.

AB Microalgae are a promising source of raw material (i.e., proteins,
   carbohydrates, lipids, pigments, and micronutrients) for various
   value-added products and act as a carbon sink for atmospheric CO2. The
   rigidity of the microalgal cell wall makes it difficult to extract
   different cellular components for its applications, including biofuel
   production, food and feed supplements, and pharmaceuticals. To improve
   the recovery of products from microalgae, pretreatment strategies such
   as biological, physical, chemical, and combined methods have been
   explored to improve whole-cell disruption and product recovery
   efficiency. However, the diversity and uniqueness of the microalgal cell
   wall make the pretreatment process more species-specific and limit its
   large-scale application. Therefore, advancing the currently available
   technologies is required from an economic, technological, and
   environmental perspective. Thus, this paper provides a state-of-art
   review of the current trends, challenges, and prospects of sustainable
   microalgal pretreatment technologies from a microalgae-based biorefinery
   concept.

AB Biofuels production needs to rely on cheap and renewable resources, in
   order to be economically viable and environmentally sustainable in the
   long term. An energy carrier could not be more environmentally friendly
   than the process to generate it. Today the diesel engine is a very
   important prime mover, being used in buses, trucks, locomotives,
   tractors, pump sets and other stationary industrial applications, small
   and medium electric power generation and marine propulsion. Solar energy
   represents the most abundant and renewable resource, and strategies for
   solar-to-fuel conversion have the potentiality to sustain our energy
   demands in the long term and to be carbon neutral. Today the world is
   facing three critical problems: high fuel prices, climatic changes, and
   air pollution. Due to the wide fields of global usage of diesel engines
   lead to ever increasing demand of petroleum derived fuels. The over
   demanding fuel and its detrimental effect on environmental have brought
   about demands for alternative fuels and energy sources that are
   convenient, environmentally friendly and economically viable. In recent
   years, the prominence to conserve petroleum based fuels has provided the
   motivation for generation of advanced biofuels which explores
   alternative technologies and feedstocks and testing of alternate fuels
   in diesel engine.. Algae and cyanobacteria offer novel solutions that
   would not compete with food for arable land. This study takes a critical
   look on the review of already existing alternative fuels that produce
   less emission or no emission at all. The advantages of the alternative
   fuels are highlighted and exhaustively discussed. The engine performance
   and emission characteristics are also discussed.

AB Hydrogen has emerged as an alternative energy source to meet the
   increasing global energy demand, depleting fossil fuels and
   environmental issues resulting from fossil fuel consumption.
   Microalgae-based biomass is gaining attention as a potential source of
   hydrogen production due to its green energy carrier properties, high
   energy content, and carbon-free combustion. This review examines the
   hydrogen production process from microalgae, including the microalgae
   cultivation technological process for biomass production, and the three
   main routes of biomass-to-hydrogen production: thermochemical
   conversion, photo biological conversion, and electrochemical conversion.
   The current progress of technological options in the three main routes
   is presented, with the various strains of microalgae and operating
   conditions of the processes. Furthermore, the economic and environmental
   perspectives of biomass-to-hydrogen from microalgae are evaluated, and
   critical operational parameters are used to assess the feasibility of
   scaling up biohydrogen production for commercial industrial-scale
   applications. The key finding is the thermochemical conversion process
   is the most feasible process for biohydrogen production, compared to the
   pyrolysis process. In the photobiological and electrochemical process,
   pure hydrogen can be achieved, but further process development is
   required to enhance the production yield. In addition, the high
   production cost is the main challenge in biohydrogen production. The
   cost of biohydrogen production for direct bio photolysis it cost around
   $7.24 kg-1; for indirect bio photolysis it costs around $7.54 kg-1and
   for fermentation, it costs around $7.61 kg-1. Therefore, comprehensive
   studies and efforts are required to make biohydrogen production from
   microalgae applications more economical in the future.

AB Tribonema minus, a promising filamentous oleaginous microalga, was
   cultured under different nutrient concentrations and different culture
   modes (fed-batch culture, two-step culture) to study the method of rapid
   regulation of its lipid metabolism. In contrast to many other oleaginous
   microalgae, T. minus did not show that nitrogen stress promoted lipid
   accumulation; however, sulfur deficiency promoted rapid lipid
   accumulation with a maximum lipid content of 54% of dry weight.
   Increasing the MgSO4 concentration significantly increased nitrogen
   uptake and biomass (10.09 g/L). Lipid productivity was significantly
   increased by the two-step culture using a medium with a high
   concentration of MgSO4 in the first step and a sulfur-free medium in the
   second step. In addition, it was found that the lipid content of T.
   minus was negatively correlated with the intracellular sulfur content
   when the intracellular sulfur content was below 0.6%. This study
   provides a new approach for industrial lipid production in T. minus.

AB The conversion of aldehydes to valuable alkanes via cyanobacterial
   aldehyde deformylating oxygenase is of great interest. The availability
   of fossil reserves that keep on decreasing due to human exploitation is
   worrying, and even more troubling is the combustion emission from the
   fuel, which contributes to the environmental crisis and health issues.
   Hence, it is crucial to use a renewable and eco-friendly alternative
   that yields compound with the closest features as conventional
   petroleum-based fuel, and that can be used in biofuels production.
   Cyanobacterial aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) is a
   metal-dependent enzyme with an alpha-helical structure that contains
   di-iron at the active site. The substrate enters the active site of
   every ADO through a hydrophobic channel. This enzyme exhibits catalytic
   activity toward converting Cn aldehyde to Cn-1 alkane and formate as a
   co-product. These cyanobacterial enzymes are small and easy to
   manipulate. Currently, ADOs are broadly studied and engineered for
   improving their enzymatic activity and substrate specificity for better
   alkane production. This review provides a summary of recent progress in
   the study of the structure and function of ADO, structural-based
   engineering of the enzyme, and highlight its potential in producing
   biofuels.

AB Microalgal species are potential resource of both biofuels and
   high-value metabolites, and their production is growth dependent. Growth
   parameters can be screened for the selection of novel microalgal species
   that produce molecules of interest. In this context our review confirms
   that, autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms have demonstrated a dual
   potential, namely the ability to produce lipids as well as value-added
   products (particularly carotenoids) under influence of various
   physico-chemical stresses on microalgae. Some species of microalgae can
   synthesize, besides some pigments, very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (VL-PUFA, >20C) such as docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic
   acid, those have significant applications in food and health. Producing
   value-added by-products in addition to biofuels, fatty acid methyl
   esters (FAME), and lipids has the potential to improve microalgae-based
   biorefineries by employing either the autotrophic or the heterotrophic
   mode, which could be an offshoot of biotechnology. The review considers
   the potential of microalgae to produce a range of products and indicates
   future directions for developing suitable criteria for choosing novel
   isolates through bioprospecting large gene pool of microalga obtained
   from various habitats and climatic conditions.

AB Microalgae have long been considered promising microorganisms, due to
   their potential as a source of valuable pharmaceuticals, pigments,
   carbohydrates, biofuels, and other fine chemicals. High-density
   microalgal photobioreactors have been considered for exploiting the
   biotechnological potential of microalgae.Haematococcus lacustrisis
   considered the richest natural source of astaxanthin for pharmaceutical,
   nutraceutical, and cosmetic applications. One of key challenges was to
   provide light sources that are more efficient, to deliver light more
   efficiently to the microalgal culture. Recent developments in highly
   efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have made possible the
   development of LED-based photobioreactors (PBR). We investigated the
   effects of various LEDs on the growth and astaxanthin production
   fromHaematococcus lacustris. The mixture of red and blue was found to be
   the most effective light source for growing this microalga. Different
   wavelength mixing ratios of red and blue were also investigated. The
   ratio of mixed red-blue of 1:3 showed the best growth and astaxanthin
   accumulation fromHaematococcus lacustris. The maximum biomass and
   astaxanthin production with illumination by mixed red-blue LEDs at a
   ratio of 1:3 obtained was 2.3 g/L and 55.1 mg/L, respectively. Biomass
   and astaxanthin were enhanced by a maximum of 3.28 g/L and 84.12 mg/L,
   with the mixed red-blue illumination in the ratio 1:3 at high light
   intensity 160 E.m-2.s-1.

AB High and changing salt concentrations represent major abiotic factors
   limiting the growth of microorganisms. During their long evolution,
   cyanobacteria have adapted to aquatic habitats with various salt
   concentrations. High salt concentrations in the medium challenge the
   cell with reduced water availability and high contents of inorganic
   ions. The basic mechanism of salt acclimation involves the active
   extrusion of toxic inorganic ions and the accumulation of compatible
   solutes, including sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol, and glycine
   betaine. The kinetics of these physiological processes has been
   exceptionally well studied in the model Synechocystis 6803, leading to
   the definition of five subsequent phases in reaching a new salt
   acclimation steady state. Recent '-omics' technologies using the
   advanced model Synechocystis 6803 have revealed a comprehensive picture
   of the dynamic process of salt acclimation involving the differential
   expression of hundreds of genes. However, the mechanisms involved in
   sensing specific salt stress signals are not well resolved. In the
   future, analysis of cyanobacterial salt acclimation will be directed
   toward defining the functions of the many unknown proteins upregulated
   in salt-stressed cells, identifying specific salt-sensing mechanisms,
   using salt-resistant strains of cyanobacteria for the production of
   bioenergy, and applying cyanobacterial stress genes to improve the salt
   tolerance of sensitive organisms.

AB Background: Amelioration of biofuel feedstock of microalgae using
   sustainable means through synthetic ecology is a promising strategy. The
   co-cultivation model (Tetraselmis striataandPelagibaca bermudensis) was
   evaluated for the robust biofuel production under varying stressors as
   well as with the selected two-stage cultivation modes. In addition, the
   role of metabolic exudates including the quorum-sensing precursors was
   assessed. Results: The co-cultivation model innovated in this study
   supported the biomass production ofT. striatain a saline/marine medium
   at a broad range of pH, salinity, and temperature/light conditions, as
   well as nutrient limitation with a growth promotion of 1.2-3.6-fold.
   Hence, this developed model could contribute to abiotic stress
   mitigation ofT. striata. The quorum-sensing precursor dynamics of the
   growth promoting bacteriaP. bermudensisexhibited unique pattern under
   varying stressors as revealed through targeted metabolomics (using
   liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, LC-MS).P. bermudensisand its
   metabolic exudates mutually promoted the growth ofT. striata, which
   elevated the lipid productivity. Interestingly, hydroxy alkyl quinolones
   independently showed growth inhibition ofT. striataon elevated
   concentration. Among two-stage cultivation modes (low pH, elevated
   salinity, and nitrate limitation), specifically, nitrate limitation
   induced a 1.5 times higher lipid content (30-31%) than control in both
   axenic and co-cultivated conditions. Conclusion:Pelagibaca bermudensisis
   established as a potential growth promoting native phycospheric bacteria
   for robust biomass generation ofT. striatain varying environment, and
   two-stage cultivation using nitrate limitation strategically maximized
   the biofuel precursors for both axenic and co-cultivation conditions (T
   and T-PB, respectively). Optimum metabolic exudate ofP. bermudensiswhich
   act as a growth substrate toT. striatasurpasses the antagonistic effect
   of excessive hydroxy alkyl quinolones [HHQ, 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines
   and PQS (pseudomonas quorum signal),
   2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone].

AB To overcome economic challenges in microalgal biofuel production, this
   study investigates the overexpression of peroxisome-localized
   peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11 (PEX11) to enhance lipid biosynthesis
   and improve salt stress resistance in Tetradesmus obliquus, aiming to
   advance microalgal biofuel production. Transgenic strains PEX11-2-1 and
   PEX11-2-2 exhibited a 2.13- and 2.51-fold increase in neutral lipid
   content and more cellular lipid droplets compared to WT, along with
   lipid yield and biomass escalating to 255.45 and 815.15 mg/L,
   respectively. This enhancement resulted from the redistribution of
   carbon precursors, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species,
   enhanced NADPH synthesis, and upregulation of lipid synthesis genes.
   Additionally, PEX11 improved salt stress tolerance by upregulating the
   expression of stress-responsive genes, including SnRK2 and PYRC. Fatty
   acid profile alterations, with increases in saturated fatty acids C16:0
   and monounsaturated fatty acids C18:1, and decreases in polyunsaturated
   fatty acids, facilitated high-quality biofuel production. These findings
   highlight novel insights for advancing microalgae-based biorefinery.

AB Thallium (Tl+) is a trace metal with extreme toxicity and is highly
   soluble in water, posing a great risk to ecological and human safety.
   This work aimed to investigate the role played by Tl+in regulating lipid
   accumulation in microalgae and the removal efficiency of Tl+. The effect
   of Tl+on the cell growth, lipid production and Tl+removal efficiency
   ofParachlorella kessleriR-3 was studied. Low concentrations of Tl+had no
   significant effect on the biomass of microalgae. When the
   Tl+concentration exceeded 5 mug L-1, the biomass of microalgae showed
   significant decrease. The highest lipid content of 63.65% and lipid
   productivity of 334.55 mg L-1d-1were obtained in microalgae treated with
   10 and 5 mug L-1Tl+, respectively. Microalgae can efficiently remove
   Tl+and the Tl+removal efficiency can reach 100% at Tl+concentrations of
   0-25 mug L-1. The maximum nitric oxide (NO) level of 470.48 fluorescence
   intensity (1 * 106cells)-1and glutathione (GSH) content of 343.51 nmol
   g-1(fresh alga) were obtained under 5 mug L-1Tl+stress conditions.
   Furthermore, the exogenous donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) supplemented
   with NO was induced in microalgae to obtain a high lipid content
   (59.99%), lipid productivity (397.99 mg L-1d-1) and GSH content (430.22
   nmol g-1(fresh alga)). The corresponding analysis results indicated that
   NO could participate in the signal transduction pathway through
   modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling to activate the
   antioxidant system by increasing the GSH content to eliminate oxidative
   damage induced by Tl+stress. In addition, NO regulation of ROS signaling
   may enhance transcription factors associated with lipid synthesis, which
   stimulates the expression of genes related to lipid synthesis, leading
   to increased lipid biosynthesis in microalgae. Moreover, it was found
   that the change in Tl+had little effect on the fatty acid components and
   biodiesel properties. This study showed that Tl+stress can promote lipid
   accumulation in microalgae for biodiesel production and simultaneously
   effectively remove Tl+, which provided evidence that NO was involved in
   signal transduction and antioxidant defense, and improved the
   understanding of the interrelation between NO and ROS to regulate lipid
   accumulation in microalgae.

AB Biofuels derived from non-crop sources, such as microalgae, offer their
   own advantages and limitations. Despite high growth rates and lipid
   accumulation, microalgae cultivation still requires more energy than it
   produces. Furthermore, invading organisms can lower efficiency of algae
   production. Simple environmental changes might be able to increase algae
   productivity while minimizing undesired organisms like competitive algae
   or predatory algae grazers. Microalgae are susceptible to pH changes. In
   many production systems, pH is kept below 8 by CO2 addition. Here, we
   uncouple the effects of pH and CO2 input, by using chemical pH buffers
   and investigate how pH influences Nannochloropsis salina growth and
   lipid accumulation as well as invading organisms. We used a wide range
   of pH levels (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). N. salina showed highest growth
   rates at pH 8 and 9 (0.190.008 and 0.190.011, respectively; meanSD).
   Maximum cell densities in these treatments were reached around 21 days
   into the experiment (95.6*1069*106 cells mL-1 for pH 8 and
   92.8*10624*106 cells mL-1 for pH 9). Lipid accumulation of unbuffered
   controls were 21.85.8% fatty acid methyl esters content by mass, and we
   were unable to trigger additional significant lipid accumulation by
   manipulating pH levels at the beginning of stationary phase. Ciliates
   (grazing predators) occurred in significant higher densities at pH 6
   (56.939.6*104 organisms mL-1) than higher pH treatments (0.1-6.8*104
   organisms mL-1). Furthermore, the addition of buffers themselves seemed
   to negatively impact diatoms (algal competitors). They were more
   abundant in an unbuffered control (12.75.1*104 organisms mL-1) than any
   of the pH treatments (3.6-4.7*104 organisms mL-1). In general, pH values
   of 8 to 9 might be most conducive to increasing algae production and
   minimizing invading organisms. CO2 addition seems more valuable to algae
   as an inorganic carbon source and not as an essential mechanism to
   reduce pH.

AB Purpose of Review: Cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae,
   are often seen as a problem. Their accumulation (bloom) in surface water
   can cause toxicity and aesthetic concerns. Efforts have been made in
   preventing and managing cyanobacterial blooms. By contrast, purposeful
   cultivation of cyanobacteria can create great opportunities in food,
   chemical and biofuel applications. This review summarises the current
   stage of research and the socio-economic impacts associated with both
   the problems and opportunities induced from the presence of
   cyanobacteria in surface water. Recent Findings: Insightful knowledge of
   factors that trigger cyanobacterial blooms has allowed for the
   development of prevention and control strategies. Advanced technologies
   are utilised to detect, quantify and treat cyanobacterial biomass and
   cyanotoxins in a timely manner. Additionally, understanding of
   cyanobacterial biochemical properties enables their applications in food
   and health industry, agriculture and biofuel production. Researchers
   have been able to genetically modify several cyanobacterial strains to
   obtain a direct pathway for ethanol and hydrogen production.

AB Background: Finding a source from which high-energy-density biofuels can
   be derived at an industrial scale has become an urgent challenge for
   renewable energy production. Some microorganisms can produce free fatty
   acids (FFA) as precursors towards such high-energy-density biofuels. In
   particular, photosynthetic cyanobacteria are capable of directly
   converting carbon dioxide into FFA. However, current engineered strains
   need several rounds of engineering to reach the level of production of
   FFA to be commercially viable; thus new chassis strains that require
   less engineering are needed. Although more than 120 cyanobacterial
   genomes are sequenced, the natural potential of these strains for FFA
   production and excretion has not been systematically estimated. Results:
   Here we present the FFA SC (FFASC), an in silico screening method that
   evaluates the potential for FFA production and excretion of
   cyanobacterial strains based on their proteomes. A literature search
   allowed for the compilation of 64 proteins, most of which influence FFA
   production and a few of which affect FFA excretion. The proteins are
   classified into 49 orthologous groups (OGs) that helped create rules
   used in the scoring/ranking of algorithms developed to estimate the
   potential for FFA production and excretion of an organism. Among 125
   cyanobacterial strains, FFASC identified 20 candidate chassis strains
   that rank in their FFA producing and excreting potential above the
   specifically engineered reference strain, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. We
   further show that the top ranked cyanobacterial strains are unicellular
   and primarily include Prochlorococcus (order Prochlorales) and marine
   Synechococcus (order Chroococcales) that cluster phylogenetically.
   Moreover, two principal categories of enzymes were shown to influence
   FFA production the most: those ensuring precursor availability for the
   biosynthesis of lipids, and those involved in handling the oxidative
   stress associated to FFA synthesis. Conclusion: To our knowledge FFASC
   is the first in silico method to screen cyanobacteria proteomes for
   their potential to produce and excrete FFA, as well as the first attempt
   to parameterize the criteria derived from genetic characteristics that
   are favorable/non-favorable for this purpose. Thus, FFASC helps focus
   experimental evaluation only on the most promising cyanobacteria.

AB Mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae is an economical and
   environment-friendly approach to benefit biofuel production by
   increasing biomass. In this study, a novel strategy of gradient addition
   of carbon source is used in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to obtain better
   biomass yields. Gradient strategy leads to low autophagy levels in
   microalgae, yielding the highest biomass of 9.42  0.21 million cells/mL
   after 15 days of cultivation. This approach produces highest chlorophyll
   (36.17  1.74 mg/mL) and carotenoids (8.85  0.52 mg/mL). At 5 g/L sodium
   acetate, gradient mode results in increased starch accumulation at the
   stationary phase, while the single-stage produces the highest
   triacylglycerol (TAG) content at the log phase. TAG production is
   mediated by the combined action of high autophagy, de novo lipid
   synthesis, and starch degradation process. Increased autophagy indicates
   high oxidative stress in single-stage which results in liquid-liquid
   phase separation (LLPS) of TAG from the cytosol, forming lipid droplets
   (LDs) for cellular redox maintenance. The LD-cytosol phase coexistence
   boundary for single-stage reveals complete LD demixing from cytosol
   above a saturated volume fraction (phisat) due to LD growth. In the
   gradient mode, LDs are small and dispersed in the cytosol. These
   differences in LD size and density are attributed to the cell's proteome
   and thermodynamic factors. For the first time, LLPS is observed to
   influence LD biogenesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Thus, this study
   unravels the metabolic regulation of mixotrophic biofuel production in
   Chlamydomonas, demonstrating gradient strategy as a promising approach
   for improving yields of various bioenergy products.

AB Algae are a group of ubiquitous photosynthetic organisms comprising
   eukaryotic green algae and Gram-negative prokaryotic cyanobacteria,
   which have immense potential as a bioresource for various industries
   related to biofuels, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and feed. This
   fascinating group of organisms also has applications in modern
   agriculture through facilitating increased nutrient availability,
   maintaining the organic carbon and fertility of soil, and enhancing
   plant growth and crop yields, as a result of stimulation of soil
   microbial activity. Several cyanobacteria provide nitrogen fertilization
   through biological nitrogen fixation and through enzymatic activities
   related to interconversions and mobilization of different forms of
   nitrogen. Both green algae and cyanobacteria are involved in the
   production of metabolites such as growth hormones, polysaccharides,
   antimicrobial compounds, etc., which play an important role in the
   colonization of plants and proliferation of microbial and eukaryotic
   communities in soil. Currently, the development of consortia of
   cyanobacteria with bacteria or fungi or microalgae or their biofilms has
   widened their scope of utilization. Development of integrated wastewater
   treatment and biomass production systems is an emerging technology,
   which exploits the nutrient sequestering potential of microalgae and its
   valorisation. This review focuses on prospects and challenges of
   application of microalgae in various areas of agriculture, including
   crop production, protection and natural resource management. An overview
   of the recent advances, novel technologies developed, their
   commercialization status and future directions are also included.

AB The conversion of light wavelength from green (500-600 nm) to red
   (600-700 nm) in the solar spectrum can significantly enhance the
   biodiesel productivity of microalgae because microalgal photosynthetic
   pigments utilize the red light more efficiently. Herein, we applied
   light-converting fluorescent films to enhance the biomass and lipid
   productivity of oleaginousChlorellasp. Although the fluorescent dyes
   have been reported to exhibit excellent fluorescence quantum yields in
   the solution state, the solid film state is more preferred to overcome
   limitations such as low stability and potential leakage issues. However,
   conventional fluorescent dyes exhibit poor emission in the solid film
   state due to aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ). Therefore, this study
   utilized aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-type diketopyrrolopyrrole
   (DPP) fluorescent dyes to overcome the ACQ problems and to fabricate
   highly efficient light-converting red fluorescent films. The fabricated
   light-converting film showed excellent photosynthetic photon flux
   density increase in the red wavelength range by AIE. A maximum total
   fatty acid methyl ester increase ofChlorellasp. was 28.8% using a
   light-converting film containing a deep-red (650-700 nm) emitting dye
   M2. In conclusion, we confirmed that the use of solar energy with
   light-converting films could boost microalgal productivity efficiently,
   even without using light-emitting diodes that require electricity.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an evolving technology that can
   convert waste with high moisture and low energy content to electricity,
   heat, hydrogen and other synthetic fuels more efficiently. The lee side
   is that the HTL process produces enormous amounts of wastewaters (HTWW),
   having high organic and nutrient load. The discharge of the HTWW would
   contaminate the environment and result in the loss of valuable bioenergy
   sources. The valorisation of HTWW has drawn considerable interest.
   Therefore, this review highlights the valorisation of wastewater during
   the HTL of biomass. The review paper begins with the discussion of the
   role of microalgae in valorizing the HTWW. The survey illustrates that
   the selection of appropriate technology is dependent on biomass
   characteristics of the microalgae. Finally, potential research
   opportunities are recommended to improve the viability of the HTL
   wastewater valorisation for bioenergy production. Overall, this review
   concludes that combining various processes, such as microalgae-anaerobic
   digestion, and bio-electrochemical system - microalgae-anaerobic
   digestion would be beneficial in maximizing HTWW valorisation.

AB Background: Within the context of microalgal lipid production for
   biofuels and bulk chemical applications, specialized higher throughput
   devices for small scale parallelized cultivation are expected to boost
   the time efficiency of phototrophic bioprocess development. However, the
   increasing number of possible experiments is directly coupled to the
   demand for lipid quantification protocols that enable reliably measuring
   large sets of samples within short time and that can deal with the
   reduced sample volume typically generated at screening scale. To meet
   these demands, a dye based assay was established using a liquid handling
   robot to provide reproducible high throughput quantification of lipids
   with minimized hands-on-time. Results: Lipid production was monitored
   using the fluorescent dye Nile red with dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent
   facilitating dye permeation. The staining kinetics of cells at different
   concentrations and physiological states were investigated to
   successfully down-scale the assay to 96 well microtiter plates.
   Gravimetric calibration against a well-established extractive protocol
   enabled absolute quantification of intracellular lipids improving
   precision from 8 to 2% on average. Implementation into an automated
   liquid handling platform allows for measuring up to 48 samples within
   6.5 h, reducing hands-on-time to a third compared to manual operation.
   Moreover, it was shown that automation enhances accuracy and precision
   compared to manual preparation. It was revealed that established
   protocols relying on optical density or cell number for biomass
   adjustion prior to staining may suffer from errors due to significant
   changes of the cells' optical and physiological properties during
   cultivation. Alternatively, the biovolume was used as a measure for
   biomass concentration so that errors from morphological changes can be
   excluded. Conclusions: The newly established assay proved to be
   applicable for absolute quantification of algal lipids avoiding
   limitations of currently established protocols, namely biomass
   adjustment and limited throughput. Automation was shown to improve data
   reliability, as well as experimental throughput simultaneously
   minimizing the needed hands-on-time to a third. Thereby, the presented
   protocol meets the demands for the analysis of samples generated by the
   upcoming generation of devices for higher throughput phototrophic
   cultivation and thereby contributes to boosting the time efficiency for
   setting up algae lipid production processes.

AB The surface and surroundings of microalgal cells (phycosphere) are
   critical interaction zones but have been difficult to functionally
   interrogate due to methodological limitations. We examined effects of
   phycosphere-associated bacteria for two biofuel-relevant microalgal
   species (Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Nannochloropsis salina) using
   stable isotope tracing and high spatial resolution mass spectrometry
   imaging (NanoSIMS) to quantify elemental exchanges at the single-cell
   level. Each algal species responded differently to bacterial attachment.
   In P. tricornutum, a high percentage of cells had attached bacteria
   (92%-98%, up to eight bacteria per alga) and fixed 64% more carbon with
   attached bacteria compared to axenic cells. In contrast, N. salina cells
   were less commonly associated with bacteria (42%-63%), harboured fewer
   bacteria per alga, and fixed 10% more carbon without attached bacteria
   compared to axenic cells. An uncultivated bacterium related to
   Haliscomenobacter sp. was identified as an effective mutualist; it
   increased carbon fixation when attached to P. tricornutum and
   incorporated 71% more algal-fixed carbon relative to other bacteria. Our
   results illustrate how phylogenetic identity and physical location of
   bacteria and algae facilitate diverse metabolic responses.
   Phycosphere-mediated, mutualistic chemical exchanges between autotrophs
   and heterotrophs may be a fruitful means to increase microalgal
   productivity for applied engineering efforts.

AB Ethanol production directly from CO2, utilizing genetically engineered
   photosynthetic cyanobacteria as a biocatalyst, offers significant
   potential as a renewable and sustainable source of biofuel. Despite the
   current absence of a commercially successful production system,
   significant resources have been deployed to realize this goal. Utilizing
   the pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas species, metabolically derived
   pyruvate can be converted to ethanol. This review of both peer-reviewed
   and patent literature focuses on the genetic modifications utilized for
   metabolic engineering and the resultant effect on ethanol yield. Gene
   dosage, induced expression and cassette optimizat-ion have been analyzed
   to optimize production, with production rates of 0.1-0.5 g L-1 day-1
   being achieved. The current 'toolbox' of molecular manipulations and
   future directions focusing on applicability, addressing the primary
   challenges facing commercialization of cyanobacterial technologies are
   discussed.

AB Biodiesel produced by microalgae has great potential as a portable
   energy that can replace traditional hydrocarbon sources. One limitation
   of scaling up algal cultivation is the availability of macronutrients,
   particularly inorganic phosphate (Pi), which is a finite and dwindling
   resource. Here,Auxenochlorella protothecoideswas adapted to low Pi
   conditions by continuous cultivation in growth media containing 100
   times less Pi (17.15 M PO4) than replete media for ~40 generations. The
   low Pi-adaptedA. protothecoidespopulations showed significantly higher
   growth rates, compared to wild type (WT) (natural, non-mutated)
   progenitor populations in batch experiments, with average maximum growth
   rates of 0.72 d-1and 0.54 d-1, respectively. Total lipid profiling of
   the adaptingA. protothecoidespopulations indicated a shift to
   non-phosphorus glycerolipids, based on UPLC/MS analyzes. The proportions
   of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and sulfoquinovosyldiacyglycerol
   (SQDG) fluctuated during adaptation, accumulating 305% and 317% of the
   WT levels respectively by the final sampling. Time-course transcriptome
   profiling ofA. protothecoidesacross all adaptation stages revealed
   initial increases in transcript levels, followed by global decreased
   expression. The short-term transcriptomic changes, prior to ~11
   generations, were associated with major metabolic pathways. The
   long-term changes indicated increased fatty acid turnover and a decrease
   in photosynthesis-related gene expression. Transcripts predicted to
   encode alternative oxidase and pyrophosphate-dependent
   phosphofructokinase fluctuated during adaptation. The selection ofA.
   protothecoidesunder low Pi conditions resulted in a microalga variant
   that after only ~40 generations utilized Pi more efficiently for growth
   than its wild type progenitor population, while also producing 1.22
   times more biomass. The adaptive processes described herein produced
   commercially relevant strain material and provide avenues for future,
   targeted engineering of molecular pathways for increased Pi use
   efficiency in similar organisms.

AB Background: Microalgae have received considerable interest as a source
   of biofuel production. The unicellular green algaPseudochoricystis
   ellipsoidea(non-validated scientific name) strain Obi appears to be
   suitable for large-scale cultivation in outdoor open ponds for biodiesel
   production because it accumulates lipids to more than 30% of dry cell
   weight under nitrogen-depleted conditions. It also grows rapidly under
   acidic conditions at which most protozoan grazers of microalgae may not
   be tolerant. The lipid productivity of this alga could be improved using
   genetic engineering techniques; however, genetically modified organisms
   are the subject of regulation by specific laws. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to develop a self-cloning-based positive selection system
   for the breeding ofP. ellipsoidea. Results: In this study, uracil
   auxotrophic mutants were isolated after the mutagenesis ofP.
   ellipsoideausing either ultraviolet light or a transcription
   activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) system. The cDNA of the uridine
   monophosphate synthase gene (PeUMPS) ofP. ellipsoideawas cloned
   downstream of the promoter of either a beta-tubulin gene (PeTUBULIN1) or
   the gene for the small subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase (PeRBCS) to construct the pUT1 or pUT2 plasmid,
   respectively. These constructs were introduced into uracil auxotroph
   strains, and genetically complementary transformants were isolated
   successfully on minimal agar plates. Use of Noble agar as the
   solidifying agent was essential to avoid the development of
   false-positive colonies. It took more than 6 weeks for the formation of
   colonies of pUT1 transformants, whereas pUT2 transformants formed
   colonies in 2 weeks. Real-time PCR revealed that there were
   morePeUMPStranscripts in pUT2 transformants than in pUT1 transformants.
   Uracil synthesis (Ura+) transformants were also obtained using a gene
   cassette consisting solely ofPeUMPSflanked by thePeRBCSpromoter and
   terminator. Conclusions: A self-cloning-based positive selection system
   for the genetic transformation ofP. ellipsoideawas developed.
   Self-clonedP. ellipsoideastrains will require less-stringent containment
   measures for large-scale outdoor cultivation.

AB Background: Microalgae are currently considered as a promising feedstock
   for the production of biofuels and high-value products. However, the
   efficient harvest of microalgal biomasses from their culture broth is a
   major challenge. The harvesting of algal biomass by flocculation
   combined with gravity sedimentation is more convenient and
   cost-effective than traditional methods such as centrifugation and
   filtration. Compared to inorganic and chemically synthetic flocculants,
   bioflocculants are a suitable choice for microalgal harvest due to their
   biodegradable and nontoxic properties. Nonetheless, the high production
   costs associated with expensive substrates hinder the commercial
   applications of bioflocculants. Previous studies have shown that the
   hydrolysates of lignocellulosic biomasses from dilute acid hydrolysis
   can be utilized as an inexpensive carbon source for the production of
   bioflocculants. However, the toxic by-products generated in the dilute
   acid hydrolysis step limit the efficiency of subsequent fermentation.
   The strains that produce bioflocculants by using untreated
   lignocellulosic materials can circumvent the pretreatment process, as
   well as promote the application of bioflocculants in microalgal harvest.
   Results: Under alkaline fermentation conditions, the alkaliphilic
   strainBacillus agaradhaerensC9 secreted 1.69 IU/mL of alkali-tolerant
   xylanase and 0.06 IU/mL of cellulase, indicating that this particular
   strain can efficiently convert untreated rice bran into bioflocculant
   (RBBF-C9), thereby circumventing rice bran pretreatment for downstream
   fermentation. The optimal fermentation conditions that result in the
   highest bioflocculant yield (12.94 g/L) were as follows: 20 g/L of
   untreated rice bran, 3 g/L of yeast extract, and 20 g/L of Na2CO3 at
   37°C for 24 h. RBBF-C9 contained 74.12% polysaccharides and 4.51%
   proteins, and was estimated to be 137 kDa. Furthermore, the
   bioflocculant RBBFC9 exhibited good flocculating efficiency (91.05%) of
   oil algaChlorella minutissimaUTEX2341 when 60 mg/L of RBBFC9 was added
   into the algal culture broth. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that
   untreated rice bran is a suitable inexpensive substrate for the
   production of bioflocculants, and thus provides a novel approach in
   utilizing rice bran. The extracted bioflocculants may be potentially
   used in biomass harvesting of the oil algaeC. minutissimaUTEX2341 from
   the culture broth.

AB Background: This batch study deals with the relation between lipid as
   well as triglyceride contents inNannochloropsis salinaand variation in
   culture conditions such as nitrogen concentration and temperature.
   Results: The tested parameters caused reduction in growth expressed as
   cell count, optical density and dry weight, as well strongly involved in
   lipids and triglycerides accumulation and significantly affected the
   lipid productivity. At the beginning of the work, the concentration of
   nitrogen in the medium was reduced to three quarter, half and quarter of
   the original f2 medium while the temperature kept constant. After that,
   the optimal nitrogen concentration (quarter of the original media)
   giving high lipid yield was tested with different temperature degrees
   from 15 to 35°C with five degree intervals. Although the growth was
   insignificantly influenced, a considerable increase in lipid and
   triglyceride (56.1 and 15.1% of dry weight respectively) was observed
   when the concentration of nitrogen in the medium was reduced to the
   quarter. Moreover, 59.3% lipid and 17.1% triglyceride on the basis of
   dry weight were obtained by the combination of 25% nitrogen
   concentration and 30°C. Simple regressions recommended that the
   interaction effect of nitrogen limitation and temperature on lipid and
   triglyceride accumulation was not as fundamental as for nitrogen
   limitation stress. Conclusion: The degree of nitrogen availability in
   the combination of temperature effect has been identified as the
   critical determinant for the maximal production of lipid inN. salina.
   Nevertheless, major advances in this field can be considered by studying
   more stresses techniques and genetic strategies.

AB The increased demand and consumption of fossil fuels have raised
   interest in finding renewable energy sources throughout the globe. Much
   focus has been placed on optimizing microorganisms and primarily
   microalgae, to efficiently produce compounds that can substitute for
   fossil fuels. However, the path to achieving economic feasibility is
   likely to require strain optimization through using available tools and
   technologies in the fields of systems and synthetic biology. Such
   approaches invoke a deep understanding of the metabolic networks of the
   organisms and their genomic and proteomic profiles. The advent of next
   generation sequencing and other high throughput methods has led to a
   major increase in availability of biological data. Integration of such
   disparate data can help define the emergent metabolic system properties,
   which is of crucial importance in addressing biofuel production
   optimization. Herein, we review major computational tools and approaches
   developed and used in order to potentially identify target genes,
   pathways, and reactions of particular interest to biofuel production in
   algae. As the use of these tools and approaches has not been fully
   implemented in algal biofuel research, the aim of this review is to
   highlight the potential utility of these resources toward their future
   implementation in algal research.

AB High outdoor temperatures significantly inhibit the growth and lipid
   production of the industrially promising marine microalgaTetraselmis
   suecica, which is viewed as a potential feedstock for high-value
   bioproducts and biofuels. To overcome this limitation,T. suecicawas
   subjected to ultraviolet irradiation to generate mutants capable of
   being productive at higher temperatures. The top two high-lipid mutants
   UV-25 and UV-31 isolated at 25°C and 31°C, respectively, were compared
   to the wild type (WT) to delineate physiological alterations and shed
   light on the mutants' increased biomass and lipid productivity. At 25°C,
   UV-25 and UV-31 exhibited lipid productivity of 36.12 and 31.33 mg/L
   day, which were 1.4- and 1.2-fold higher than WT, respectively. This
   increase in lipid biosynthesis correlated well with increased carotenoid
   content in UV-25 (2.2-fold) and UV-31 (3.6-fold), indicating an improved
   capacity to quench reactive oxygen species. At 31°C, the growth and
   lipid accumulation of UV-31 remained high, signifying adaptation to
   higher temperatures. This is attributed to a well-coordinated modulation
   of the mutant's cellular metabolism through an increase in galactose and
   phosphatidylglycerol levels, as well as in protein, all of which
   contributed to its performance at elevated temperatures. The study
   successfully established a UV mutagenesis strategy for producing
   superior- performing microalgae strains with industrially desired
   traits, paving the way for future outdoor cultivation deployment.

AB Background: Cyanobacteria are ideal model organisms to exploit
   photosynthetically derived electrons or fixed carbon for the
   biotechnological synthesis of high value compounds and energy carriers.
   Much effort is spent on the rational design of heterologous pathways to
   produce value-added chemicals. Much less focus is drawn on the basic
   physiological responses and potentials of phototrophs to deal with
   natural or artificial electron and carbon sinks. However, an
   understanding of how electron sinks influence or regulate cellular
   physiology is essential for the efficient application of phototrophic
   organisms in an industrial setting, i.e., to achieve high productivities
   and product yields. Results: The physiological responses of the
   cyanobacteriumSynechocystissp. PCC 6803 to electron sink variation were
   investigated in a systematic and quantitative manner. A variation in
   electron demand was achieved by providing two N sources with different
   degrees of reduction. By additionally varying light and
   CO2availabilities, steady state conditions with strongly differing
   source-sink ratios were established. Balancing absorbed photons and
   electrons used for different metabolic processes revealed physiological
   responses to sink/source ratio variation. Surprisingly, an additional
   electron sink under light and thus energy limitation was found not to
   hamper growth, but was compensated by improved photosynthetic efficiency
   and activity. In the absence of carbon and light limitation, an increase
   in electron demand even stimulated carbon assimilation and growth.
   Conclusion: The metabolism ofSynechocystissp. PCC 6803 is highly
   flexible regarding the compensation of additional electron demands.
   Under light limitation, photosynthesis obviously does not necessarily
   run at its maximal capacity, possibly for the sake of robustness.
   Increased electron demands can even boost photosynthetic activity and
   growth.

AB Microalgae have received a great deal of attention among researchers in
   recent decades in the production of sustainable bioenergy due to the
   limitations of second-generation biofuels. However, scalability and
   economics are the two key challenges that need to be overcome for
   sustainable biofuel production at field level, and mathematical
   modelling can be utilized as an effective tool to evaluate the
   influencing factors. This article focuses on the mathematical modelling
   of microalgal growth and carbon dioxide sequestration potential of a
   fixed photobioreactor (PBR) at 25° inclination facing south and a
   two-axis trackable PBR in Odisha, India. The total geographic area of
   Odisha has been represented in 1195 spatial sites, each site
   representing around 130 sq. km of the real scale dimensions
   approximately. The model incorporates site-specific data of solar
   radiation, climatic conditions and PBR configurations to derive the
   bioenergy content of microalgal biomass by photon energy balance. The
   effect of photoinhibition was also studied, and the outputs from the
   mathematical modelling, such as daily microalgal lipid production and
   carbon dioxide sequestration potential were plotted for the whole of
   Odisha using QGIS software. The net microalgal biomass production rate
   drastically reduced to around 30% and 40% due to the effect of
   photoinhibition in the case of fixed and trackable PBR systems
   respectively. The outcome of the present study could influence the
   policy-makers for selecting suitable sites for the implementation of
   microalgal-based biofuel production facility.

AB Microalgae have been used widely as a biological source for several
   industries, such as biofuel, pharmaceutical and food. Recently, the
   agricultural industry has also began using microalgae as an alternative
   source for sustainable products to replace agrochemicals. Due to the
   lack of scientific articles in this research area, the objective of this
   study was to search for applications of microalgae and to characterize
   its use in agriculture using the patent documents available in three
   patent databases, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),
   European Patent Office (EPO) and Brazilian Institute of Industrial
   Property (INPI). The search was carried out using the keyword
   "microalgae" and applying the filter for International Patent
   Classification (IPC) code "A01N" which corresponds to patents related to
   agriculture and cultivation of microalgae. Our patent database search
   returned 669 documents and 132 patents were selected for the study based
   on their abstracts. The first patent was registered in 1982 and
   described the use of microalgaeChlorellaextract as a plant growth
   promoter. After that, no patent was registered for 15 years. From 2005
   to 2014, only seven patents were found. However, the scenario changed
   from 2015 when the number of patents increased mainly in the United
   States, China and Europe. The patent analysis showed several
   applications for microalgae in the agricultural sector, such as plant
   growth promotion, biofertilization, plant disease control, weed
   management, and post-harvest quality. This review confirmed the
   increasing interest in microalgae-derived products in agriculture and
   the value of using patent documents to assess innovative areas.

AB Biofuel is an ideal alternative to traditional fossil fuels, and
   microalgae is excellent raw materials for the production of biofuels.
   Through the understanding of the synthesis and regulation of microalgae
   lipid, the production efficiency of biodiesel by microalgae can be
   effectively improved. Transcription factors are protein molecules with
   special functional structures that perform the function of regulating
   gene expression. In the complex lipid synthesis and metabolism process,
   transcription factors can collectively regulate multiple enzyme lines in
   the metabolic process, thus promoting lipid accumulation in algal cells.
   The synthesis pathway of microalgae lipid was introduced, the key
   enzymes in the synthesis pathway were briefly introduced, and the
   regulation effect of bZIP, MYB, Dof and bHLH transcription factors on
   the microalgae lipid synthesis was reviewed. Microalgae lipid synthesis
   involves multiple pathways of multiple subcellular units, and is a very
   complex metabolic network process, and changing the expression of
   related enzymes in the synthetic pathways by genetic engineering means
   can increase lipid accumulation in microalgae.

U2 361
AB Microalgae are considered as the most promising renewable feedstock for
   biofuel production and biorefineries, due to their advantages of fast
   growth, efficient carbon dioxide fixation, not competing for arable
   lands and potable water, and potentially accumulating high amounts of
   lipids and carbohydrates. Since carbohydrates in microalgae biomass are
   mainly cellulose in the cell wall and starch in the plastids without
   lignin and low hemicelluloses contents, they can be readily converted
   into fermentable sugars. However, to date there are very few studies
   focusing on the use of microalgae-based carbohydrates for biofuel
   production, which requires more understanding and knowledge to support
   the technical feasibility of this next-generation feedstock. This review
   article elucidates comprehensive information on the characteristics and
   metabolism of main fermentable microalgal carbohydrates (e.g., starch
   and cellulose), as well as the key factors and challenges that should be
   addressed during production and saccharification of microalgal
   carbohydrates. Furthermore, developments on the utilization of
   microalgae-based feedstock in producing liquid and gaseous biofuels are
   summarized. The objective of this article is to provide useful knowledge
   and information with regard to biochemistry, bioprocess engineering, and
   commercial applications to assist in the viable technology development
   of for biofuels generation from microalgae-based carbohydrates.

AB This case study is part of a circular bioeconomy project for a winery
   company aiming to integrate a microalgae-based system within the
   existing facilities of the winery WWTP, promoting nutrient recovery and
   transformation into valuable products and bioenergy. Microalgae were
   used for wastewater treatment, removing N-NH4+ (97%) and P-PO4-3 (93%).
   A pilot anaerobic reactor was used for batch anaerobic mono-digestion of
   secondary sludge (WAS) and for co-digestion of WAS and algal biomass.
   The methane yield using WAS from two different wine production seasons
   was 155.4 and 132.9 NL CH4 kg VS-1. Co-digestion led to the highest
   methane yield (225.8 NL CH4 kg VS-1). The application of the bio-wastes
   for fertilization was assessed through plant growth bioassays: mono- and
   co-digestion digestates and dry algal biomass enhanced plant biomass
   accumulation (growth indexes of 163%, 155% and 121% relative to those of
   the control - commercial amendment, respectively), demonstrating a lack
   of phytotoxicity.

AB Catabolism of glycogen stored by cyanobacteria occurs during anaerobic
   auto-fermentation and produces a range of C1-C3 fermentation products
   and hydrogen via hydrogenase. We investigated both augmenting and
   rerouting this carbon catabolism by engineering the glycolysis pathway
   at the NAD+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
   (GAPDH-1), its major regulation site at the nexus of two pathways
   (Oxidative Pentose Phosphate pathway, OPP, and
   glycolysis/gluconeogenesis). Null (gap1::aphII) and overexpression
   (gap1+) strains of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 were constructed in
   order to produce more NADPH (via rerouting carbon through OPP) and more
   NADH (via opening the glycolytic bottleneck), respectively. For
   gap1::aphII quantitative analyses after four days of dark
   auto-fermentation showed undiminished glycogen catabolism rate,
   significant increases of intracellular metabolites in both OPP and
   upper-glycolysis, decrease in lower-glycolysis intermediates, 5.7-fold
   increase in NADPH, 2.3-fold increase in hydrogen and 1.25-fold increase
   in CO2vs. wild type (WT). These changes demonstrate the expected outcome
   of redirection of carbon catabolism through the OPP pathway with
   significant stimulation of OPP product yields. The gap1+ strain exhibits
   a large 17% increase in accumulation of glycogen during the prior
   photoautotrophic growth stage (gluconeogenesis), in parallel with a
   2-fold increase in the total [NAD++NADH] pool, foreshadowing an
   increased catabolic capacity. Indeed, the rate of glycogen catabolism
   during subsequent dark auto-fermentation increased significantly (58%)
   vs. WT, resulting in increases in both NADH (4.0-fold) and NADPH
   (2.9-fold) pools, and terminal fermentation products, hydrogen
   (3.0-fold) D-lactate (2.3-fold) and acetate (1.4-fold). The overall
   energy conversion yield over four days from catabolized glycogen to
   hydrogen increased from 0.6 mole of hydrogen per mole of glucose (WT) to
   1.4 (gap1::aphII) and 1.1 (gap1+) under headspace accumulation
   conditions (without hydrogen milking). These findings demonstrate the
   significant potential of metabolic engineering for redirecting carbon
   pathways for carbohydrate catabolism and hydrogen production in
   cyanobacteria.

AB Wastewater contains many organic and inorganic contaminants that can
   cause serious damage to the environment and health of people, Therefore,
   they have to be eliminated before being downloaded into sensitive areas.
   Different methods of wastewater purification have been used for
   contaminants removal. However, they present some technical and economic
   limitations. Thus, new methods of nutrients removal by microalgae based
   on phytoremediation techniques, become promising methods due to its
   viability. The objective of wastewater treatment is to improve and
   purify the water. For that, the removal of all or some of the nutrients
   present in water is carried out, resulting in a reusable or suitable
   water to be returned to its natural environment. This study investigates
   the capacity of Chlorella vulgaris microalga as a potential candidate
   for removing the phosphorous and organic matter from wastewater. The
   strain of microalga was cultivated in synthetic wastewater at room
   temperature with artificial illumination and aeration. Algal growth
   parameters such as pH, chemical oxygen demand, phosphorus, cell number,
   optical density and dry weight were measured during experimental period.
   Under these conditions, microalgae were able to remove the phosphorus
   concentration by more than 99%. By other hand, the chemical oxygen
   demand was reduced at 71%. After 9 days of cultivation, the biomass
   concentration increased from 0.05 to 0.57 g/L. The results of this study
   suggest that growing Chlorella Vulgaris microalgae in wastewater offers
   a new option of applying algae to manage the nutrient load. After then
   obtained biomass can be used for biofuel production.

   possess several advantages as organisms for bioindustrial processes,
   including simple input requirements, tolerance of marginal agricultural
   environments, rapid genetics, and carbon-neutral applications that could
   be leveraged to address global climate change concerns. Here, we review
   recent research involving the engineering of cyanobacterial species for
   the production of valuable bioindustrial compounds, including natural
   cyanobacterial products (e.g. sugars and isoprene), biofuels (e.g.
   alcohols, alkanes and hydrogen), and other commodity chemicals.
   Biological and economic obstacles to scaled cyanobacterial production
   are highlighted, and methods for increasing cyanobacterial production

AB Background: Cyanobacteria are potential sources of renewable chemicals
   and biofuels and serve as model organisms for bacterial photosynthesis,
   nitrogen fixation, and responses to environmental changes. Anabaena
   (Nostoc) sp. strain PCC 7120 (hereafter Anabaena) is a multicellular
   filamentous cyanobacterium that can "fix" atmospheric nitrogen into
   ammonia when grown in the absence of a source of combined nitrogen.
   Because the nitrogenase enzyme is oxygen sensitive, Anabaena forms
   specialized cells called heterocysts that create a microoxic environment
   for nitrogen fixation. We have employed directional RNA-seq to map the
   Anabaena transcriptome during vegetative cell growth and in response to
   combined-nitrogen deprivation, which induces filaments to undergo
   heterocyst development. Our data provide an unprecedented view of
   transcriptional changes in Anabaena filaments during the induction of
   heterocyst development and transition to diazotrophic growth. Results:
   Using the Illumina short read platform and a directional RNA-seq
   protocol, we obtained deep sequencing data for RNA extracted from
   filaments at 0, 6, 12, and 21 hours after the removal of combined
   nitrogen. The RNA-seq data provided information on transcript abundance
   and boundaries for the entire transcriptome. From these data, we
   detected novel antisense transcripts within the UTRs (untranslated
   regions) and coding regions of key genes involved in heterocyst
   development, suggesting that antisense RNAs may be important regulators
   of the nitrogen response. In addition, many 5′ UTRs were longer than
   anticipated, sometimes extending into upstream open reading frames
   (ORFs), and operons often showed complex structure and regulation.
   Finally, many genes that had not been previously identified as being
   involved in heterocyst development showed regulation, providing new
   candidates for future studies in this model organism. Conclusions:
   Directional RNA-seq data were obtained that provide comprehensive
   mapping of transcript boundaries and abundance for all transcribed RNAs
   in Anabaena filaments during the response to nitrogen deprivation. We
   have identified genes and noncoding RNAs that are transcriptionally
   regulated during heterocyst development. These data provide detailed
   information on the Anabaena transcriptome as filaments undergo
   heterocyst development and begin nitrogen fixation.

AB In recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), waste management of
   nutrient-rich byproducts accounts for 30-50% of the whole production
   costs. Integrating microalgae into RAS offers complementary solutions
   for transforming waste streams into valuable co-products. This review
   aims to provide an overview of recent advances in microalgae application
   to enhance RAS performance and derive value from all waste streams by
   using RAS effluents as microalgal nutrient sources. Aquaculture solid
   waste can be converted by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), then the
   resultant aqueous phase of HTL can be used for microalgae cultivation.
   In addition, microalgae generate the required oxygen while sequestering
   carbon dioxide. The review suggests a novel integrated system focusing
   on oxygenation and carbon dioxide capture along with recent
   technological developments concerning efficient microalgae cultivation
   and nutrient recovery techniques. In such system, microalgae-based
   biorefineries provide environmentally-conscious and economically-viable
   pathways for enhanced RAS performance and conversion of effluents into
   high-value products.

AB The Azolla-Anabaena symbiotic association has been the focus of
   attention as a N-biofertilizer in many South East Asian countries. Its
   widespread utilization has been limited mainly due to its relative
   sensitivity to extremes of temperature and light intensity, and labour
   intensive production technology. Besides its utilization in agriculture,
   Azolla has been also employed in bioremediation of waste water and
   reclamation of saline soils. Its high protein content makes it suitable
   as a feed supplement for cattle and poultry and its rich biomass finds
   use in bioenergy production. This review traces the historical
   background of Azolla utilization and synthesizes the past and present
   research findings on its potential in agriculture and environmental
   management. The development of molecular techniques in recent times has
   aided in improving our understanding regarding several aspects of the
   diversity and evolution of Azolla-Anabaena symbioses. There is a
   definite need to exploit the potential of this symbiotic association in
   a more efficient manner in the future, through biotechnological
   interventions and in-depth analyses of metabolic networks existing in
   this prokaryotic-eukaryotic association.

AB Replacement of energy intensive mechanical aeration with sustainable
   oxygenic photosynthesis by microalgae at cathode was studied in
   dual-chambered microbial fuel cell (MFC). The synergistic association
   between bacterial fermentation at anode and the oxygenic photosynthesis
   of microalgae at cathode facilitated good power output as well as
   treatment efficiency. However, MFC operation during spring showed higher
   bioelectrogenic activity (57.0 mW/m2) over summer (1.1 mW/m2) due to the
   higher oxygenic photosynthetic activity of microalgae and respective
   dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. This can be attributed to RuBisCO
   inactivation under high temperatures and light intensity of summer,
   which prevented rich algal biomass growth as well as their
   photosynthetic activity. Unlike abiotic cathode, the algal cathode
   potential increased with operation time due to the algal biomass growth
   during spring but was negligible during summer. The catalytic currents
   on voltammetric signatures and the bioprocess parameters also
   corroborated well with the observed power output.

AB Background: Microalgae are widely studied for biofuel production.
   Nevertheless, harvesting step of biomass is still a critical challenge.
   Bioflocculants have been applied in numerous applications including the
   low-cost harvest of microalgae. A major bottleneck for commercial
   application of bioflocculant is its high production cost.
   Lignocellulosic substrates are abundantly available. Hence, the
   hydrolyzates of rice stover and corn stover have been used as carbon
   source to produce the bioflocculant in previous studies. However, the
   hydrolyzates of biomass required the neutralization of pH before the
   downstream fermentation processes, and the toxic by-products produced
   during hydrolysis process inhibited the microbial activities in the
   subsequent fermentation processes and contaminated the bioflocculant
   product. Therefore, strains that can secrete plant cell-wall-degrading
   enzymes and simultaneously produce bioflocculants through directly
   degrading the lignocellulosic biomasses are of academic and practical
   interests. Results: A lignocellulose-degrading strainCellulosimicrobium
   cellulansL804 was isolated in this study, which can produce the
   bioflocculant MBF-L804 using untreated biomasses, such as corn stover,
   corn cob, potato residues, and peanut shell. The effects of culture
   conditions including initial pH, carbon source, and nitrogen source on
   MBF-L804 production were analyzed. The results showed that over 80%
   flocculating activity was achieved when the corn stover, corn cob,
   potato residues, and peanut shell were used as carbon sources and 4.75
   g/L of MBF-L804 was achieved under the optimized condition: 20 g/L dry
   corn stover as carbon source, 3 g/L yeast extract as nitrogen source, pH
   8.2. The bioflocculant MBF-L804 contained 68.6% polysaccharides and
   28.0% proteins. The Gel permeation chromatography analysis indicated
   that the approximate molecular weight (MW) of MBF-L804 was 229 kDa. The
   feasibility of harvesting microalgaeChlamydomonas
   reinhardtiiandChlorella minutissimausing MBF-L804 was evaluated. The
   highest flocculating efficiencies forC. reinhardtiiandC. minutissimawere
   99.04 and 93.83%, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows for the
   first time thatC. cellulansL804 can directly convert corn stover, corn
   cob, potato residues and peanut shell into the bioflocculants, which can
   be used to effectively harvest microalgae.

AB The purpose of this work was to investigate the viability of a
   microalgae catalytic pyrolysis/hydrotreating plant to kerosene, diesel
   and gasoline using Aspen Plus. A series of 2000 dry tonne per day
   scenarios were simulated with the final goal of determine the price in
   USD per litre of the drop-in fuels produced and the economic feasibility
   of the technique at a large-scale. Different scenarios (mechanical,
   solar and thermal drying), microalgae (NannochloropsisandIsochrysis) and
   catalysts (Li-LSX zeolite, Ni-Ce/Al2O3, Ni-Ce/ZrO2). For this work, a
   systematic design approach by Douglas was considered and the whole
   process was actualised with the Marshall and Swift Cost Index of 2016.
   The lowest minimum fuel selling price (1.418 $/L) was found for
   Isochrysis and Li-LSX-zeolite. Finally, the sensitivity analysis showed
   that the bio-oil yield was the most influent factor, leading to a
   variation of the fuel price between 1.158 $/L to 1.751 $/L assuming a
   20% of variation. The techno-economic assessment and sensitivity
   analysis indicated thatIsochrysisand Li-LSX-zeolites are promising for
   the production of drop-in fuels, but further research is required to
   further reduce the price of the feedstock production and drying to be
   competitive with lignocellulosic materials.

AB Microalgae are photosynthetic microbes that can synthesize compounds of
   therapeutic potential with wide applications in the food, bioprocessing
   and pharmaceutical sector. Recent research advances have therefore,
   focused on finding suitable economic substrates for the sustainable
   cultivation of microalgae. Among such substrates, food derived waste
   specifically from the starch, meat, dairy, brewery, oil and fruit and
   vegetable processing industries has gained popularity but poses numerous
   challenges. Pretreatment, dilution of waste water supernatants, mixing
   of different food waste streams, utilizing two-stage cultivation and
   other biorefinery approaches have been intensively explored for
   multifold improvement in microalgal biomass recovery from food waste.
   This review discusses the advances and challenges associated with
   cultivation of microalgae on food waste. The review suggests that there
   is a need to standardize different waste substrates in terms of general
   composition, genetically engineered microalgal strains, tackling process
   scalability issues, controlling wastewater toxicity and establishing a
   waste transportation chain.

AB Bio-coatings serve as artificial scaffolds for immobilizing microalgae
   to facilitate cell concentration and harvesting. It has been used as an
   additional step to enhance the natural microalgal biofilm cultivation
   and to promote new opportunities in artificially-immobilize cultivation
   technology of microalgae. This technique is able to enhance biomass
   productivities, enable energy and cost saving, water volume reduction
   and ease of biomass harvesting since the cells are physically isolated
   from the liquid medium. However, scientific discoveries of bio-coatings
   for process intensification are still lacking and their working
   principles remained unclear. Therefore, this critical review aims to
   shed light on the advancement of cell encapsulation systems (hydrogel
   coating, artificial leaf, bio-catalytic latex coating, and cellular
   polymeric coating) over the years and aid in the selection of
   appropriate bio-coating techniques for various applications. Discussion
   on the different preparation routes of bio-coatings, as well as the
   exploration towards the potential of bio-based coating materials such as
   natural/synthetic polymers, latex binders, and algal organic matters are
   also included, with a focus on sustainable pursuits. This review also
   presents in-depth investigations into the environmental applications of
   bio-coatings in wastewater remediation, air purification, carbon
   bio-fixation, and bio-electricity. The field of bio-coating in
   microalgae immobilization gives rise to a new ecofriendly strategy with
   scalable cultivation footprint and a balanced environmental risk
   aligning with the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals with
   potential towards the contribution of Zero Hunger, Clean Water and

AB Microalgae-based bioenergy has been long considered as a promising
   substitute to replace the fossil fuels at large-scale. After the decades
   of research, several bottlenecks remain to be overcome to make the
   large-scale production of microalgal bioenergy commercially viable. In
   this review, the bottlenecks that restrict the commercial production of
   microalgal bioenergy are summarized as "high cost" and "low efficiency"
   and then identified in detailed categories. Several solutions which aim
   to solve the bottlenecks are presented and discussed correspondingly.
   The solutions presented in this review including cultivating in
   wastewater, recycling water and nutrients, utilizing the whole biomass,
   selecting indigenous strains, cultivating mixed-species, supplementing
   low-cost organic substrates, mixing vertically in reactor, optimizing
   metabolic pathway and attaching the cells on suspended-solids.
   Furthermore, a novel system integrated with the solutions, which is
   combined with the wastewater treatment system and characterized as the
   mixed-species cultivation of wild-selected mixotrophic microalgal
   strains in suspended-solid phase bioreactor based on low-cost substrate,
   is proposed to promote the scale-up of the microalgal cultivation for
   bioenergy production.

AB Flue gas generated by combustion of natural gas in a boiler was used for
   outdoor cultivation ofChlorellasp. in a 55 m2culture area
   photobioreactor. A 6 mm thick layer of algal suspension continuously
   running down the inclined lanes of the bioreactor at 50 cm s-1was
   exposed to sunlight. Flue gas containing 6-8% by volume of
   CO2substituted for more costly pure CO2as a source of carbon for
   autotrophic growth of algae. The degree of CO2mitigation (flue gas
   decarbonization) in the algal suspension was 10-50% and decreased with
   increasing flue gas injection rate into the culture. A dissolved
   CO2partial pressure (pCO2) higher than 0.1 kPa was maintained in the
   suspension at the end of the 50 m long culture area in order to prevent
   limitation of algal growth by CO2. NOXand CO gases (up to 45 mg
   m-3NOXand 3 mg m-3CO in flue gas) had no negative influence on the
   growth of the alga. On summer days the following daily net
   productivities of algae [g (dry weight) m-2] were attained in
   comparative parallel cultures: flue gas=19.4-22.8; pure CO2=19.1-22.6.
   Net utilization (eta) of the photosynthetically active radiant (PAR)
   energy was: flue gas=5.58-6.94%; pure CO2=5.49-6.88%. The mass balance
   of CO2obtained for the flue gas stream and for the algal suspension was
   included in a mathematical model, which permitted the calculation of
   optimum flue gas injection rate into the photobioreactor, dependent on
   the time course of irradiance and culture temperature. It was estimated
   that about 50% of flue gas decarbonization can be attained in the
   photobioreactor and 4.4 kg of CO2is needed for production of 1 kg (dry
   weight) algal biomass. A scheme of a combined process of farm unit size
   is proposed; this includes anaerobic digestion of organic agricultural
   wastes, production and combustion of biogas, and utilization of flue gas
   for production of microalgal biomass, which could be used in animal
   feeds. A preliminary quantitative assessment of the microalgae
   production is presented.

AB Currently, lipid extraction remains a major bottleneck in microalgae
   technology for biofuel production. In this study, an effective and
   easily controlled cell wall disruption method based on electro-Fenton
   reaction was used to enhance lipid extraction from the wet biomass of
   Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1. The results showed that 1.27 mM of
   hydroxide radical (HO*) was generated under the optimal conditions with
   9.1 mM FeSO4 in a 16.4 mA.cm-2 current density for 37.0 min. After the
   electro-Fenton treatment, the neutral lipid extraction yield of
   microalgae (~155 mg) increased from 40% to 87.5%, equal to from 12.2% to
   26.7% dry cell weight (DCW). In particular, the fatty acid composition
   remained stable. The cell wall disruption and lipid extraction processes
   were displayed by the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and
   fluorescence microscopy (FM) observations, respectively. Meanwhile, the
   removal efficiency of algal cells reached 85.2% within 2 h after the
   reaction was terminated. Furthermore, the biomass of the microalgae
   cultured in the electrolysis wastewater treated with fresh nutrients
   reached 3 g/L, which is 12-fold higher than that of the initial after 24
   days. These finds provided an economic and efficient method for lipid
   extraction from wet microalgae, which could be easily controlled by
   current magnitude regulation.

AB In order to study the role of sufficient phosphorus (P) in biodiesel
   production by microalgae, Phaeodactylum tricornutum were cultivated in
   six different media treatments with combination of nitrogen (N)
   sufficiency/deprivation and phosphorus
   sufficiency/limitation/deprivation. Profiles of N and P, biomass, and
   fatty acids (FAs) content and compositions were measured during a 7-day
   cultivation period. The results showed that the FA content in microalgae
   biomass was promoted by P deprivation. However, statistical analysis
   showed that FA productivity had no significant difference (p=0.63,
   >0.05) under the treatments of N deprivation with P sufficiency (N-P)
   and N deprivation with P deprivation (N-P-), indicating P sufficiency in
   N deprivation medium has little effect on increasing biodiesel
   productivity from P. triornutum. It was also found that the P absorption
   in N-P medium was 1.41 times higher than that in N sufficiency and P
   sufficiency (NP) medium. N deprivation with P limitation (N-P-l) was the
   optimal treatment for producing biodiesel from P. triornutum because of
   both the highest FA productivity and good biodiesel quality.

   freshwater microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Scenedesmus
   subspicatus grown in batch culture in limiting concentrations of
   nitrogen (N). Both algae exhibited restricted cell division and
   increased cell size following N-limitation. FTIR spectra of cells in
   N-limited media showed increasing lipid:amide I and carbohydrate:amide I
   ratios over time. The use of lipid- and starch-staining dyes confirmed
   that the observed ratio changes were due to increased lipid and
   carbohydrate synthesis. These results demonstrate rapid metabolic
   responses of C. reinhardtii and S. subspicatus to changing nutrient
   availability, and indicate the efficiency of FTIR as a reliable method
   for high-throughput determination of lipid induction.

AB Bio-butanol, composed of four carbon hydrocarbons, is a biofuel produced
   from biomass feedstock by microbial activities. Butanol is used in
   making pharmaceutical, cosmetics, plastic, textiles, and fuel additives.
   Bio-production of butanol merely depends on acetone-butanol-ethanol
   (ABE) fermentation of clostridia at present. However, industrial butanol
   production with native and primitive organisms is not quantitatively and
   economically compatible as compared to that of fossil fuels, due to low
   titer, oxygen intolerance, slow growth, butanol toxicity, and by-product
   accumulation in the process. Therefore, metabolic engineering of
   microbes, including yeast, cyanobacteria, clostridial, and other
   bacterial species, was adopted as an approach for removing limitations
   associated with the process and produces a cost-effective butanol in
   higher amounts. In this regard, metabolic engineering strategies, such
   as inactivation of pathways competing with butanol by knocking out
   genes, introduction of engineered and more efficient enzymes in both
   natural and heterologous butanol producers, overexpression of genes
   involved in the butanol pathway, increased strain robustness to
   solvents, and creation of butanol pathway in non-native producers, have
   been applied to enable microorganisms, to enhance their capability to
   produce high amounts of cost-effective butanol and to reduce
   difficulties associated with bio-butanol synthesis such as butanol
   toxicity and by-product production. Therefore, we reviewed and
   summarized the recent advancements in metabolic engineering of
   microorganisms for butanol isomers (1-butanol and isobutanol)
   production.

AB Background: Butanol production directly from CO2in photosynthetic
   cyanobacteria is restricted by the high toxicity of butanol to the
   hosts. In previous studies, we have found that a few two-component
   signal transduction systems (TCSTSs) were differentially regulated
   inSynechocystissp. PCC 6803 after butanol treatment. Results: To explore
   regulatory mechanisms of butanol tolerance, in this work, by
   constructing gene knockout mutants of the butanol-responsive TCSTS genes
   and conducting tolerance analysis, we uncovered that an
   orphanslr1037gene encoding a novel response regulator was involved in
   butanol tolerance inSynechocystis. Interestingly, the
   &Delta;slr1037mutant grew similarly to the wild type under several other
   stress conditions tested, which suggests that its regulation on butanol
   tolerance is specific. Using a quantitative iTRAQ LC-MS/MS proteomics
   approach coupled with real-time reverse transcription PCR, we further
   determined the possible butanol-tolerance regulon regulated by Slr1037.
   The results showed that, afterslr1037deletion, proteins involved in
   photosynthesis and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis of central metabolic
   processes, and glutaredoxin, peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase and
   glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase with stress-responsive functions
   were down-regulated, suggesting that Slr1037 may exhibit regulation to a
   wide range of cellular functions in combating butanol stress.
   Conclusions: The study provided a proteomic description of the putative
   butanol-tolerance regulon regulated by theslr1037gene. As the first
   signal transduction protein identified directly related to butanol
   tolerance, response regulator Slr1037 could be a natural candidate for
   transcriptional engineering to improve butanol tolerance
   inSynechocystis.

AB Microalgal lipids hold significant potential for the production of
   biodiesel and dietary supplements. To enhance their cost-effectiveness
   and commercial competitiveness, it is imperative to improve microalgal
   lipid productivity. Metabolic engineering that targets the key enzymes
   of the fatty acid synthesis pathway, along with transcription factor
   engineering, are effective strategies for improving lipid productivity
   in microalgae. This review provides a summary of the advancements made
   in the past 5 years in engineering the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway
   in eukaryotic microalgae. Furthermore, this review offers insights into
   transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and transcription factor
   engineering aimed at enhancing lipid production in eukaryotic
   microalgae. Finally, the review discusses the challenges and future
   perspectives associated with utilizing microalgae for the efficient
   production of lipids.

AB Free fatty acids (FFA) generated in cyanobacterial cells can be utilized
   for the biodiesel that is required for our sustainable future. The
   combination of FFA and strong light induces severe photoinhibition of
   photosystem II (PSII), which suppresses the production of FFA in
   cyanobacterial cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of
   exogenously added FFA on the photoinhibition of PSII inSynechocystissp.
   PCC 6803. The addition of lauric acid (12:0) to cells accelerated the
   photoinhibition of PSII by inhibiting the repair of PSII and the de novo
   synthesis of D1. alpha-Linolenic acid (18:3) affected both the repair of
   and photodamage to PSII. Surprisingly, palmitic (16:0) and stearic acids
   (18:0) enhanced the repair of PSII by accelerating the de novo synthesis
   of D1 with the mitigation of the photoinhibition of PSII. Our results
   show chemical potential of FFA in the regulation of PSII without genetic
   manipulation.

AB New sources of biomass for biofuels production had been studied in
   recent years. Microalgae as oil donors for biodiesel production are a
   very attractive alternative due to their several benefits but it still
   is a process that must overcome several technological barriers. Oil
   composition and the amount of free fatty acid (FFA) makes the microalgae
   oil a difficult yet promising alternative. In this paper, sequential
   stages of esterification and then transesterification were studied to
   convert the microalgae oil (MAO) in biodiesel, glycerol, and water
   mostly. A more realistic microalgae oil composition was simulated using
   9 triglycerides (TG) and 9 FFA's in contrast with other studies were 1-5
   components are used to represent the oil. A sensitivity analysis was
   performed to determine the temperature effect on the glycerol and water
   concentration. Finally, energy integration alternatives were analyzed to
   find a cost-effective way to produce biodiesel from MAO.

TI Enhanced starch accumulation in Chlorella sorokiniana as sugar platform
   and the expression profiling of key regulatory proteins.
SO Industrial Crops and Products
VL 213
PY 2024
U1 4
U2 20
AB Microalgae can accumulate considerable starch as a renewable sugar
   platform for biofuel production. In this study, Chlorella sorokiniana
   exhibited a significant increase in starch content from 3.0% to 49.5% DM
   under sulfur limitation (SL) conditions, and the lower the concentration
   of sulfur was, the more effective it was. Direct enzymatic hydrolysis of
   wet biomass resulted in a glucose yield of 97.1%, indicating its
   potential for fermentable sugar production. However, C. sorokiniana grew
   slowly, and cell division and biomass accumulation decreased under SL
   conditions, which could be explained by the decreased photosynthetic
   efficiency and protein content. The sulfur replenishment (SR) confirmed
   the rapid response of C. sorokiniana in starch accumulation to sulfur
   availability. Thus, we further investigated the expression profiling of
   key regulatory proteins under Control-SL-SR stages. The expression of
   AGPase A was strongly induced in the SL stage and subsequently
   downregulated during SR stage, suggesting its role as a key regulatory
   protein for enhanced starch accumulation. Additionally, downregulation
   of SBE and GBE expression likely contributed to structural modifications
   of the starch molecules. These proteins could serve as potential targets
   for metabolic engineering in further improving the starch production
   capacity in C. sorokiniana.

AB Large-scale microalgae cultivation for biofuel production is currently
   limited by the possibility of maintaining high microalgae yield and high
   lipid content, concomitantly. In this study, the physiological changes
   of Chlorella vulgaris NIES 227 during lipid accumulation under nutrient
   limitation was monitored in parallel with the photosynthetic capacity of
   the microalgae to fix carbon from the proxy of oxygen productivity. In
   the exponential growth phase, as the biomass composition did not vary
   significantly (approx. 53.6  7.8% protein, 6.64  3.73% total lipids, and
   26.0  9.2% total carbohydrates of the total biomass dry-weight), the
   growth capacity of the microalgae was preserved (with net O2
   productivity remaining above (4.44  0.93) * 10-7 g O2.mol PAR-1). Under
   nutrient limitation, protein content decreased (minimum of approx. 18.6 
   6.0%), and lipid content increased (lipid content up to 56.0  0.8%). The
   physiological change of the microalgae was associated with a loss of
   photosynthetic activity, down to a minimum (1.27  0.26) * 10-7 g O2.mol
   PAR-1. The decrease in photosynthetic O2 productivity was evidenced to
   correlate to the cell internal-protein content (R2 = 0.632, p = 2.04 *
   10-6, N = 25). This approach could serve to develop productivity models,
   with the aim of optimizing industrial processes.

U1 2
U2 34
AB Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, are a group of prokaryotic
   microorganisms largely distributed in both terrestrial and aquatic
   environments. They produce a wide range of bioactive compounds that are
   mostly used in cosmetics, animal feed and human food, nutraceutical and
   pharmaceutical industries, and the production of biofuels. Nowadays, the
   research concerning the use of cyanobacteria in agriculture has pointed
   out their potential as biofertilizers and as a source of bioactive
   compounds, such as phycobiliproteins, for plant pathogen control and as
   inducers of plant systemic resistance. The use of alternative products
   in place of synthetic ones for plant disease control is also encouraged
   by European Directive 2009/128/EC. The present up-to-date review gives
   an overall view of the recent results on the use of cyanobacteria for
   both their bioprotective effect against fungal and oomycete
   phytopathogens and their plant biostimulant properties. We highlight the
   need for considering several factors for a proper and sustainable
   management of agricultural crops, ranging from the mechanisms by which
   cyanobacteria reduce plant diseases and modulate plant resistance to the
   enhancement of plant growth.

AB This special issue includes a selection of 10 articles presented at the
   conference providing information on the global food crisis, long-term
   sustainability of biofuels, food safety and nutrition, and constraints
   and incentives for innovation and globalization. In addition, two
   roundtable sessions were held on co-existence and intellectual property
   rights. Article 1 provides an overview of the structural outline of the
   conference and then a concise summary of the four themes of the
   conference. In article 2, the Black Swan metaphor, introduced by Nicolas
   Talab, is described as the 2008/09 financial crisis. It is argued that
   the financial crisis provides an opportunity to address other
   threatening issues that can result in Black Swan events, such as energy
   insecurity and climate change with the associated extreme weather
   events. The third article showed that the introduction of biofuels
   reduced international fuel prices and gasoline consumed by oil-importing
   countries by 1 and 1.2%, respectively. At the same time however, the
   total amount of fuel consumed (oil-importing and exporting countries)
   increased by 1.15% due to the reduction in fuel prices. Article 4
   compares two types of microalgae production technology using Monte Carlo
   simulation. One production assessment is based on standard technologies,
   while the other is calibrated on more advanced technologies. An
   assessment of the European biofuel policy landscape is described in
   article 5. The main European biofuel policy consists of a mandate for a
   5.75% rate by 2010 and a 10% rate by 2020 of the final consumption of
   energy in transport from renewable energy sources within each EU member
   state. Article 6 estimates the effect of the hurdle rate on adoption and
   diffusion of GM crops in the United States, which is the first study
   using ex-post cultivation data. A significant irreversibility effect for
   the adoption of Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) and herbicide-resistant
   maize and the diffusion of herbicide-resistant soyabeans are
   illustrated. A comparison is given in article 7 regarding the attitudes
   of stakeholders in Switzerland and New Zealand with respect to
   agricultural biotechnology as part of sustainable agriculture. Article 8
   presents the results of the Institute for Prospective Technological
   Studies' workshop on 'The Global Commercial Pipeline of New GM Crops.
   The workshop acknowledged that as of 2008, there were 33 different GM
   crops in production worldwide and that this is expected to increase to
   124 by 2015. Meanwhile, article 9 provides one of the initial
   assessments on the role of industry associations relating to
   agricultural biotechnology. The review and economic impact of Ag-West
   Biotech, a not-for-profit corporation located in the agricultural
   biotechnology cluster in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, highlights the
   importance of a central actor in the facilitation of innovative
   clusters. The structure of the business model is presented, and then
   undertakes an assessment of the entity's three key activities:
   financing, networking, and advocacy. The last article provides an
   analysis of the potential economic impacts of cloning in the dairy
   industry, including an extensive review of reproductive technology
   options and a description of the advantages and limitations of using
   cloning as a reproductive technology. To provide an economic estimate of
   the impacts, a Monte Carlo simulation model is used to generate changes
   in net present values.

AB The high content of lipids in microalgae (>60% w/w in some species) and
   of carbohydrates in seaweed (up to 75%) have promoted intensive research
   towards valorisation of algal components for the production of biofuels.
   However, the exploitation of the carbohydrate fraction to produce a
   range of chemicals and chemical intermediates with established markets
   is still limited. These include organic acids (e.g. succinic and lactic
   acid), alcohols other than bioethanol (e.g. butanol), and biomaterials
   (e.g. polyhydroxyalkanoates). This review highlights current and
   potential applications of the marine algal carbohydrate fractions as
   major C-source for microbial production of biomaterials and building
   blocks.

AB This review provides a complete overview over a spectrum of areas where
   value-added applications of algae are in sight, from conventional food,
   feed, dietary supplement, and cosmetics to novel technologies for
   environmental and biofuel applications. In most cases macro- and
   microalgae are discussed separately due to their inherent differences
   from cultivation. Comparison of various cultivation systems are made in
   relation to specific value-added products. The potential uses of algal
   biomeal, the sizable waste stream generated after extraction of targeted
   compounds such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
   (DHA) from the biomass of cultivated microalgae, are also discussed
   based on the concept of waste-recovery and biorefinery. The article
   presents some promising patents on potential industrial applications of
   macro- and microalgae.

AB Exogenous supplementation of phytohormones to promote the selective
   enrichment of biomolecules without hampering biomass production is
   regarded as a promising approach to improve the techno-economic
   feasibility of biofuels and other value-added products derived from
   microalgae. The present work outlines the influence of natural auxin,
   indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and two synthetic analogues, 1-naphthalene
   acetic acid (NAA), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acetic acid (2,4-D) on
   the growth pattern and biochemical productivity of the green
   algaAnkistrodesmus falcatusCMSACR1001. A maximum biomass production of
   431 mg L-1with a concomitant increase in the protein and carbohydrate
   content (20.2% and 49.6% DCW respectively) was achieved under
   supplementation of 10 muM IAA. Biomass productivity at 1 muM
   concentration was found to be comparable for both IAA and NAA (32.8 mg
   L-1day-1and 32.4 mg L-1day-1). At higher supplemented concentrations
   2,4-D induced a 30-40% increase in carotenoid production and exhibited
   an increased lipid content of 41-47% DCW as compared with control (34.2%
   DCW). The current study also reports a substantial increase in the
   neutral lipid proportion as much as 73.9% and 79% under supplementation
   of NAA and 2,4-D respectively at 100 muM. The results indicate that the
   auxin and its analogues under the study could increase the biomass
   production and favourably modulate the biochemical composition ofA.

AB Microalgae have long been considered as one of most promising feedstocks
   with better characteristics for biofuels production over conventional
   energy crops. There have been a wide range of estimations on the
   feasibility of microalgal biofuels based on various productivity
   assumptions and data from different scales. The theoretical maximum
   algal biofuel productivity, however, can be calculated by the amount of
   solar irradiance and photosynthetic efficiency (PE), assuming other
   conditions are within the optimal range. Using the actual surface solar
   irradiance data around the world and PE of algal culture systems,
   maximum algal biomass and biofuel productivities were calculated, and
   feasibility of algal biofuel were assessed with the estimation. The
   results revealed that biofuel production would not easily meet the
   economic break-even point and may not be sustainable at a large-scale
   with the current algal biotechnology. Substantial reductions in the
   production cost, improvements in lipid productivity, recycling of
   resources, and utilization of non-conventional resources will be
   necessary for feasible mass production of algal biofuel. Among the
   emerging technologies, cultivation of microalgae in the ocean shows
   great potentials to meet the resource requirements and economic
   feasibility in algal biofuel production by utilizing various marine
   resources.
