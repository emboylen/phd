# From Algae to Energy: A Sustainable Roadmap for WA’s Biofuel Future

## Overview

This PhD research investigates the development of sustainable microalgal biofuel production systems in Western Australia (WA). Algae-based biofuels present a promising alternative to fossil fuels, owing to their high biomass productivity and lipid content. WA offers ideal conditions for large-scale cultivation due to its vast land area, favourable climate, and potential supply chains; however, commercial implementation remains limited due to insufficient investment and policy support.

This project adopts an interdisciplinary **Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA)** framework integrating environmental, economic, social, and technological dimensions, alongside policy analysis, to identify optimal microalgal biofuel production pathways specifically for Geraldton and Karratha regions.

## Research Objectives

1. **Feasibility Assessment:** Evaluate technical, economic, environmental, and social feasibility of case study microalgal biofuel systems in Geraldton and Karratha.
2. **Policy Development:** Formulate evidence-based policy recommendations and an implementation roadmap to promote algae biofuel adoption in WA.
3. **Model Development:** Create and validate predictive models forecasting long-term sustainability and performance under varying scenarios and uncertainties.
4. **Knowledge Integration:** Bridge bioenergy research and policy to support Western Australia’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

## Background

- Microalgal biofuels efficiently produce biomass rich in lipids suitable for biofuel conversion.
- WA's geographic and climatic conditions support cost-effective large-area cultivation.
- Global case studies (e.g., Brazil, USA) demonstrate the critical role of policy in biofuel industry development.
- Sustainability assessments typically focus on Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC), but social factors require more attention via Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA).
- The LCSA framework uniquely integrates environmental, economic, and social aspects to present a holistic feasibility study.

## Methodology

- **Literature Review:** Identify research gaps concerning sustainability and biofuel policy, especially in the WA context.
- **Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment:** Employ LCSA and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to evaluate biofuel options comprehensively.
- **Policy Analysis:** Compare global biofuel policies and tailor recommendations suitable for WA’s economic and regulatory environment.
- **Modelling & Validation:** Develop predictive sustainability models; conduct scenario and sensitivity analyses; deliver a practical implementation roadmap.

## Expected Contributions

- Holistic sustainability evaluation of microalgal biofuels in WA specific settings.
- Novel integrated policy-research framework to facilitate biofuel industry uptake.
- Predictive tools aiding decision-making under future uncertainties.
